Of all YASR syndromes , the highest stability was for the Anxious / Depressed scale .
Here we investigate the mechanism of TPA induction of FGF:__entity__ -:__entity__ BP:__entity__ gene expression in the human ME - 180 SCC cell line .
Between the RNA initiation site and the coding region is a GC - rich hairpin structure followed by 8 T residues that looks like a rho:__entity__ -:__entity__ independent:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ terminator:__entity__ .
Conversely the rate of bioavailability was significantly different , because from the Reference patch the release rate is fast in the first 24 h , leading to an E2 peak at 8 h and to a Cmax in average at 23 h .
3 ) The progress of fibrinolysis was observed by serial collection of middle ear fluid in the same side ear of 5 cases out of 17 cases having much activity for fibrin:__entity__ degradation , and lowering of fibrinolytic activity was revealed in 4 out of these 5 cases as the result .
Thus G17:__entity__ targets the c:__entity__ -:__entity__ fos:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ CArG:__entity__ sequence:__entity__ via Rho:__entity__ A:__entity__ - dependent pathways , and Rho:__entity__ A:__entity__ appears to play an important role in the regulation of the trophic action of G17:__entity__ .
The MIC90 of ABK against coagulase:__entity__ type:__entity__ IV:__entity__ strains was rather high , 12 . 5 micrograms / ml .
In each patient , MBF was quantified in the three major vascular territories : the left anterior descending and left circumflex coronary artery territories and the right coronary artery ( control region ) territory .
These results demonstrate that m2:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ couple to both G:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ i2:__entity__ and G:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ i3:__entity__ in vivo and that this interaction is integral to both positive and negative regulatory pathways leading to activation of PLC:__entity__ and desensitization of receptor signaling .
Platelet count and plasma volume were significantly higher in group A than in group B throughout pregnancy .
The fru:__entity__ gene:__entity__ has seven exons spanning 15 - kb encoding two transcripts with ORFs of 841 and 695 amino acids .
HC:__entity__ -:__entity__ toxin:__entity__ exerts a potent cytostatic effect on plant and animal cells by inhibiting histone:__entity__ deacetylase:__entity__ .
The human RIL:__entity__ gene:__entity__ : mapping to human chromosome 5q31 . 1 , genomic organization and alternative transcripts .
The delta mean VAF and delta mean SABP indicated varied mean values of VAF and SABP , respectively .
Azoospermia was graded in the following way : adequate spermatozoa ( A1 ) , low , scanty or rare spermatozoa ( A2 ) , spermatid arrest ( B1 ) , spermatocyte arrest ( B2 ) , Sertoli cell - only pattern ( C ) and sclerosis ( D ) .
