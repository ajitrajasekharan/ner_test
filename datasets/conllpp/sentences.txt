Japan:__entity__ began the defence of their Asian:__entity__ Cup:__entity__ title with a lucky 2-1 win against Syria:__entity__ in a Group C championship match on Friday .
But China:__entity__ saw their luck desert them in the second match of the group , crashing to a surprise 2-0 defeat to newcomers Uzbekistan:__entity__ .
China:__entity__ controlled most of the match and saw several chances missed until the 78th minute when Uzbek:__entity__ striker Igor:__entity__ Shkvyrin:__entity__ took advantage of a misdirected defensive header to lob the ball over the advancing Chinese:__entity__ keeper and into an empty net .
Oleg:__entity__ Shatskiku:__entity__ made sure of the win in injury time , hitting an unstoppable left foot shot from just outside the area .
The former Soviet:__entity__ republic was playing in an Asian:__entity__ Cup:__entity__ finals tie for the first time .
Despite winning the Asian:__entity__ Games:__entity__ title two years ago , Uzbekistan:__entity__ are in the finals as outsiders .
Two goals from defensive errors in the last six minutes allowed Japan:__entity__ to come from behind and collect all three points from their opening meeting against Syria:__entity__ .
Takuya:__entity__ Takagi:__entity__ scored the winner in the 88th minute , rising to head a Hiroshige:__entity__ Yanagimoto:__entity__ cross towards the Syrian:__entity__ goal which goalkeeper Salem:__entity__ Bitar:__entity__ appeared to have covered but then allowed to slip into the net .
It was the second costly blunder by Syria:__entity__ in four minutes .
Defender Hassan:__entity__ Abbas:__entity__ rose to intercept a long ball into the area in the 84th minute but only managed to divert it into the top corner of Bitar:__entity__ 's goal .
Nader:__entity__ Jokhadar:__entity__ had given Syria:__entity__ the lead with a well-struck header in the seventh minute .
Japan:__entity__ then laid siege to the Syrian:__entity__ penalty area for most of the game but rarely breached the Syrian:__entity__ defence .
Bitar:__entity__ pulled off fine saves whenever they did .
Japan:__entity__ coach Shu:__entity__ Kamo:__entity__ said : ' ' The Syrian:__entity__ own goal proved lucky for us .
The Syrians:__entity__ scored early and then played defensively and adopted long balls which made it hard for us . '
'
Japan:__entity__ , co-hosts of the World:__entity__ Cup:__entity__ in 2002 and ranked 20th in the world by FIFA:__entity__ , are favourites to regain their title here .
Hosts UAE:__entity__ play Kuwait:__entity__ and South:__entity__ Korea:__entity__ take on Indonesia:__entity__ on Saturday in Group A matches .
All four teams are level with one point each from one game .

ROME:__entity__ 1996-12-06
Italy:__entity__ recalled Marcello:__entity__ Cuttitta:__entity__
on Friday for their friendly against Scotland:__entity__ at Murrayfield:__entity__ more than a year after the 30-year-old wing announced he was retiring following differences over selection .
Cuttitta:__entity__ , who trainer George:__entity__ Coste:__entity__ said was certain to play on Saturday week , was named in a 21-man squad lacking only two of the team beaten 54-21 by England:__entity__ at Twickenham:__entity__ last month .
Stefano:__entity__ Bordon:__entity__ is out through illness and Coste:__entity__ said he had dropped back row Corrado:__entity__ Covi:__entity__ , who had been recalled for the England:__entity__ game after five years out of the national team .
Cuttitta:__entity__ announced his retirement after the 1995:__entity__ World:__entity__ Cup:__entity__ , where he took issue with being dropped from the Italy:__entity__ side that faced England:__entity__ in the pool stages .
Coste:__entity__ said he had approached the player two months ago about a comeback .
" He ended the World:__entity__ Cup:__entity__ on the wrong note , " Coste:__entity__ said .
" I thought it would be useful to have him back and he said he would be available .
I think now is the right time for him to return . "

Japan:__entity__ then laid siege to the Syrian:__entity__ penalty area and had a goal disallowed for offside in the 16th minute .
A minute later , Bitar:__entity__ produced a good double save , first from Kazuyoshi:__entity__ Miura:__entity__ 's header and then blocked a Takagi:__entity__ follow-up shot .
Bitar:__entity__ saved well again from Miura:__entity__ in the 37th minute , parrying away his header from a corner .
Japan:__entity__ started the second half brightly but Bitar:__entity__ denied them an equaliser when he dived to his right to save Naoki:__entity__ Soma:__entity__ 's low drive in the 53rd minute .

Centre Jason:__entity__ Little:__entity__ will miss Australia:__entity__ 's end-of-tour fixture against the Barbarians:__entity__ at Twickenham:__entity__ on Saturday .
Little:__entity__ has opted not to risk aggravating the knee injury which ruled him out of a large chunk of the tour and is replaced by fellow Queenslander:__entity__ Daniel:__entity__ Herbert:__entity__ .
Owen:__entity__ Finegan:__entity__ has recovered from the knocks he took in last weekend 's test against Wales:__entity__ and retains his place in the back-row ahead of Daniel:__entity__ Manu:__entity__ .
The Wallabies:__entity__ have their sights set on a 13th successive victory to end their European:__entity__ tour with a 100 percent record but also want to turn on the style and provide David:__entity__ Campese:__entity__ with a fitting send-off in his final match in Australian:__entity__ colours .
The Wallabies:__entity__ currently have no plans to make any special presentation to the 34-year-old winger but a full house of 75,000 spectators will still gather in the hope of witnessing one last moment of magic .
Campese:__entity__ will be up against a familiar foe in the shape of Barbarians:__entity__ captain Rob:__entity__ Andrew:__entity__ , the man who kicked Australia:__entity__ to defeat with a last-ditch drop-goal in the World:__entity__ Cup:__entity__ quarter-final in Cape:__entity__ Town:__entity__ .
" Campo:__entity__ has a massive following in this country and has had the public with him ever since he first played here in 1984 , " said Andrew:__entity__ , also likely to be making his final Twickenham:__entity__ appearance .
On tour , Australia:__entity__ have won all four tests against Italy:__entity__ , Scotland:__entity__ , Ireland:__entity__ and Wales:__entity__ , and scored 414 points at an average of almost 35 points a game .
League duties restricted the Barbarians:__entity__ ' selectorial options but they still boast 13 internationals including England:__entity__ full-back Tim:__entity__ Stimpson:__entity__ and recalled wing Tony:__entity__ Underwood:__entity__ , plus All:__entity__ Black:__entity__ forwards Ian:__entity__ Jones:__entity__ and Norm:__entity__ Hewitt:__entity__ .

Midfielder Valentin:__entity__ Stefan:__entity__ and striker Viorel:__entity__ Ion:__entity__ of Otelul:__entity__ Galati:__entity__ and defender Liviu:__entity__ Ciobotariu:__entity__ of National:__entity__ Bucharest:__entity__ are the newcomers for the European:__entity__ group eight clash in Macedonia:__entity__ on December 14 .

CRICKET - LARA:__entity__ ENDURES ANOTHER MISERABLE DAY .
Robert:__entity__ Galvin:__entity__
MELBOURNE:__entity__ 1996-12-06
Australia:__entity__ gave Brian:__entity__ Lara:__entity__ another reason to be miserable when they beat West:__entity__ Indies:__entity__ by five wickets in the opening World:__entity__ Series:__entity__ limited overs match on Friday .
Lara:__entity__ , disciplined for misconduct on Wednesday , was dismissed for five to extend a disappointing run of form on tour .
Australia:__entity__ , who hold a 2-0 lead in the five-match test series , overhauled West:__entity__ Indies:__entity__ ' total of 172 all out with eight balls to spare to end a run of six successive one-day defeats .
All-rounder Greg:__entity__ Blewett:__entity__ steered his side to a comfortable victory with an unbeaten 57 in 90 balls to the delight of the 42,442 crowd .
Man-of-the match Blewett:__entity__ came to the wicket with the total on 70 for two and hit three fours during an untroubled innings lasting 129 minutes .
His crucial fifth-wicket partnership with fellow all-rounder Stuart:__entity__ Law:__entity__ , who scored 21 , added 71 off 85 balls .
Lara:__entity__ looked out of touch during his brief stay at the crease before chipping a simple catch to Shane:__entity__ Warne:__entity__ at mid-wicket .
West:__entity__ Indies:__entity__ tour manager Clive:__entity__ Lloyd:__entity__ has apologised for Lara:__entity__ 's behaviour on Tuesday .
He ( Lara:__entity__ ) had told Australia:__entity__ coach Geoff:__entity__ Marsh:__entity__ that wicketkeeper Ian:__entity__ Healy:__entity__ was unwelcome in the visitors ' dressing room .
The Melbourne:__entity__ crowd were clearly angered by the incident , loudly jeering the West:__entity__ Indies:__entity__ vice-captain as he walked to the middle .
It was left to fellow left-hander Shivnarine:__entity__ Chanderpaul:__entity__ to hold the innings together with a gritty 54 despite the handicap of an injured groin .
Chanderpaul:__entity__ was forced to rely on a runner for most of his innings after hurting himself as he scurried back to his crease to avoid being run out .
Pakistan:__entity__ , who arrive in Australia:__entity__ later this month , are the other team competing in the World:__entity__ Series:__entity__ tournament .

CRICKET - LARA:__entity__ SUFFERS MORE AUSTRALIAN:__entity__ TOUR MISERY .
MELBOURNE:__entity__ 1996-12-06
West:__entity__ Indies:__entity__ batsman Brian:__entity__ Lara:__entity__ suffered another blow to his Australian:__entity__ tour , after already being disciplined for misconduct , when he was dismissed cheaply in the first limited overs match against Australia:__entity__ on Friday .
Lara:__entity__ , who earned a stern rebuke from his own tour management after an angry outburst against Australia:__entity__ wicketkeeper Ian:__entity__ Healy:__entity__ , scored five to prolong a run of poor form with the bat .
The West:__entity__ Indies:__entity__ vice-captain struggled for timing during his 36-minute stay at the crease before chipping a ball from medium pacer Tom:__entity__ Moody:__entity__ straight to Shane:__entity__ Warne:__entity__ at mid-wicket .
West:__entity__ Indies:__entity__ were 53 for two in 15 overs when rain stopped play at the Melbourne:__entity__ Cricket:__entity__ Ground:__entity__ after captain Courtney:__entity__ Walsh:__entity__ won the toss and elected to bat .
Lara:__entity__ 's outburst three days ago has clearly turned some of the Australian:__entity__ public against him .
As he walked to the wicket he was greeted by loud jeers from sections of the crowd .
On several occasions during his innings , the crowd joined together in a series of obscene chants against him .
Tour manager Clive:__entity__ Lloyd:__entity__ on Wednesday apologised for Lara:__entity__ 's behaviour in confronting Australia:__entity__ coach Geoff:__entity__ Marsh:__entity__ in the opposition dressing room to protest against his dismissal in the second test on Tuesday .
Lloyd:__entity__ did not say what form the discipline would take .
Lara:__entity__ , who holds the record for the highest score in test and first-class cricket , was unhappy about Healy:__entity__ 's role in the incident and questioned whether the ball had carried to the Australia:__entity__ keeper .
Australia:__entity__ went on to win the match at the Sydney:__entity__ Cricket:__entity__ Ground:__entity__ by 124 runs to take a two-nil lead in the five-test series after Lara:__entity__ failed in both innings .
Lara:__entity__ has yet to score a century since West:__entity__ Indies:__entity__ arrived in Australia:__entity__ five weeks ago .
Both West:__entity__ Indies:__entity__ and Australia:__entity__ team management have played down the incident , stressing that relations between the two sides have not been adversely affected .
Pakistan:__entity__ , who arrive next week , are the third team in the triangular World:__entity__ Series:__entity__ tournament .

FIFA:__entity__ chairman Joao:__entity__ Havelange:__entity__ said on Friday he would personally present AC:__entity__ Milan:__entity__ George:__entity__ Weah:__entity__ with world soccer 's fair play award despite the striker 's attack on Porto:__entity__ captain Jorge:__entity__ Costa:__entity__ .
In an interview with the Italian:__entity__ newspaper Gazzetta:__entity__ dello:__entity__ Sport:__entity__ , he was quoted as saying Weah:__entity__ had been provoked into the assault which left Costa:__entity__ with a broken nose .
" FIFA:__entity__ has named the Liberian:__entity__ for its 1996 Fair Play award and it is not going to change its decision , " Havelange:__entity__ said .
" A reaction , provoked , cannot erase 10 years of loyalty everywhere and in every competition .
" I will be happy to give him the award personally on January 20 in Lisbon:__entity__ and I 'm confident that Costa:__entity__ himself will be there beside me on that day to shake his hand . "
Weah:__entity__ was suspended for one match by UEFA:__entity__ , European:__entity__ soccer 's governing body , pending a fuller investigation .
The incident took place in the players ' tunnel after a European:__entity__ Champions:__entity__ ':__entity__ League:__entity__ match on November 20 .
Weah:__entity__ has admitted head butting Costa:__entity__ but said he reacted to racist taunts .
He has offered to apologise if Costa:__entity__ acknowledges the provocation .
Costa:__entity__ , who needed surgery on his nose , has not accepted the offer and was reported to be considering suing Weah:__entity__ .
Weah:__entity__ served out his suspension during Milan:__entity__ 's 2-1 home defeat by Rosenborg:__entity__ of Norway:__entity__ on Wednesday .
The defeat put the Italians:__entity__ out of the Europoean:__entity__ Cup:__entity__ .

SOCCER - ITALIAN:__entity__ FIRST DIVISION MATCHES THIS WEEKEND .
ROME:__entity__ 1996-12-06
Italian:__entity__ Serie:__entity__ A:__entity__ games to be played on Sunday ( league positions in parentheses , all kick- off times GMT:__entity__ ) :
Bologna:__entity__ ( 4 ) v Piacenza:__entity__ ( 13 ) 1330
Along with leaders Vicenza:__entity__ , fourth-placed Bologna:__entity__ represent the biggest surprise of this Italian:__entity__ autumn .
Led as usual by Swede:__entity__ Kennet:__entity__ Andersson:__entity__ and Russian:__entity__ Igor:__entity__ Kolyvanov:__entity__ in attack , Bologna:__entity__ can expect a tough home match against a Piacenza:__entity__ side still exultant after a 3-2 league win over AC:__entity__ Milan:__entity__ last Sunday .
Cagliari:__entity__ ( 16 ) v Reggiana:__entity__ ( 18 ) 1530
Cagliari:__entity__ start favourite in this relegation scrap following draws with Napoli:__entity__ and Inter:__entity__ in last two outings but will be without suspended Swiss:__entity__ defender Ramon:__entity__ Vega:__entity__ .
Bottom team Reggiana:__entity__ are also without a suspended defender , German:__entity__ Dietmar:__entity__ Beiersdorfer:__entity__ .
Fiorentina:__entity__ ( 10 ) v Perugia:__entity__ ( 8 ) 1330
Fiorentina:__entity__ will be without three suspended players -- defenders Daniele:__entity__ Carnasciali:__entity__ and Lorenzo:__entity__ Amoruso:__entity__ and midfielder Emiliano:__entity__ Bigica:__entity__ -- for a difficult home match against unpredictable , attack-oriented Perugia:__entity__ led by in-form Croat:__entity__ striker Milan:__entity__ Rapajic:__entity__ and the experienced Fausto:__entity__ Pizzi:__entity__ .
Lazio:__entity__ ( 12 ) v AS:__entity__ Roma:__entity__ ( 7 ) 1930
Poor man 's Roman:__entity__ derby in what has been a miserable season for both Rome:__entity__ teams , already eliminated from the Italian:__entity__ and UEFA:__entity__ Cups:__entity__ .
Lazio:__entity__ have injury doubts about striker Pierluigi:__entity__ Casiraghi:__entity__ , Czech:__entity__ midfielder Pavel:__entity__ Nedved:__entity__ and defender Paolo:__entity__ Negro:__entity__ , while Roma:__entity__ present a full strength side led by Argentine:__entity__ Abel:__entity__ Balbo:__entity__ , Marco:__entity__ Delvecchio:__entity__ and Francesco:__entity__ Totti:__entity__ in attack .
AC:__entity__ Milan:__entity__ ( 9 ) v Udinese:__entity__ ( 11 ) 1330
Can Milan:__entity__ sink any further ?
Following their midweek Champions:__entity__ ':__entity__ League:__entity__ elimination by Norwegian:__entity__ side Rosenborg:__entity__ , a morale-boosting win is badly needed .
Liberian:__entity__ striker George:__entity__ Weah:__entity__ makes a welcome return for Milan:__entity__ alongside Roberto:__entity__ Baggio:__entity__ , with Montenegrin:__entity__ Dejan:__entity__ Savicevic:__entity__ in midfield .
Good news for Milan:__entity__ is that Udinese:__entity__ 's German:__entity__ striker Oliver:__entity__ Bierhoff:__entity__ is out through injury .
Napoli:__entity__ ( 5 ) v Verona:__entity__ ( 17 ) 1330
In-form Napoli:__entity__ should prove too strong for second from bottom Verona:__entity__ despite the absence of their suspended Argentine:__entity__ defender Roberto:__entity__ Ayala:__entity__ .
Verona:__entity__ 's slim chances have been further reduced by a knee injury to their experienced midfielder Eugenio:__entity__ Corini:__entity__ .
Parma:__entity__ ( 14 ) v Atlalanta:__entity__ ( 15 ) 1330
Parma:__entity__ may field new signing , Croat:__entity__ midfielder Mario:__entity__ Stanic:__entity__ , in an attempt to lift a miserable season which has seen them go without a win since a 1-0 triumph over Cagliari:__entity__ eight weeks ago .
Parma:__entity__ 's French:__entity__ midfielder Daniel:__entity__ Bravo:__entity__ and defender Fabio:__entity__ Cannavaro:__entity__ are suspended while Argentine:__entity__ Nestor:__entity__ Sensini:__entity__ is out through injury .
Atalanta:__entity__ look to Filippo:__entity__ Inzaghi:__entity__ , scorer of eight goals .
Sampdoria:__entity__ ( 6 ) v Juventus:__entity__ ( 3 ) 1330
All-conquering Juventus:__entity__ field their most recent signing , Portuguese:__entity__ defender Dimas:__entity__ , while Alessandro:__entity__ Del:__entity__ Piero:__entity__ and Croat:__entity__ Alen:__entity__ Boksic:__entity__ lead the attack .
The new world club champions may prove too strong for a Sampdoria:__entity__ side led by captain Roberto:__entity__ Mancini:__entity__ but missing injured French:__entity__ midfielder Pierre:__entity__ Laigle:__entity__ .
Vicenza:__entity__ ( 1 ) v Internazionale:__entity__ ( 2 ) 1330
Not exactly a clash of the titans but an intriuguing match nonetheless .
Full strength Vicenza:__entity__ , led by Uruguayan:__entity__ Marcelo:__entity__ Otero:__entity__ , may continue their surprise run at the top against an Inter:__entity__ side that has been less than impressive in three successive home draws .
Inter:__entity__ will be without suspended French:__entity__ defender Joceyln:__entity__ Angloma:__entity__ and injured Chilean:__entity__ striker Ivan:__entity__ Zamorano:__entity__ .

GUNMEN KILL FOUR IN S.AFRICA:__entity__ 'S ZULU:__entity__ PROVINCE:__entity__ .
DURBAN:__entity__ , South:__entity__ Africa:__entity__ 1996-12-06
At least four people have been shot dead in two suspected political attacks in South:__entity__ Africa:__entity__ 's volatile Zulu:__entity__ heartland:__entity__ , police said on Friday .
A police spokesman said two youths believed to be supporters of President Nelson:__entity__ Mandela:__entity__ 's African:__entity__ National:__entity__ Congress:__entity__ ( ANC:__entity__ ) had been killed when unknown gunmen opened fire at the rural settlement of Izingolweni:__entity__ on KwaZulu-Natal:__entity__ province 's south coast on Thursday night .
The victims were 18 and 20 , he said , adding one other youth had been wounded in the shooting .
In another attack , also on the province 's south coast on Thursday night , two men were shot dead near Umkomaas:__entity__ .
" We suspect that these killings are linked to politics , " spokesman Bala:__entity__ Naidoo:__entity__ told Reuters:__entity__ .
There had been no arrests .
The killings came just hours after violence monitors said they were not optimistic of a peaceful festive season in KwaZulu-Natal:__entity__ and pointed the south coast region where 18 people were massacred last Christmas as one of potential hot spots .
They said the recent lull in political feuding could be upset as thousands of migrant workers , some tense with grudges brewed in the cities and keen to settle old scores , flock back to their home villages .
More than 14,000 people have lost their lives in over a decade of political turf wars between the ANC:__entity__ and Zulu:__entity__ Chief Mangosuthu:__entity__ Buthelezi:__entity__ 's Inkatha:__entity__ Freedom:__entity__ Party:__entity__ in the province .

HAVEL:__entity__ PRAISES CZECH:__entity__ NATIVE ALBRIGHT:__entity__ AS FRIEND .

PRAGUE:__entity__ 1996-12-06
Czech:__entity__ President Vaclav:__entity__ Havel:__entity__ on Friday welcomed the appointment of Madeleine:__entity__ Albright:__entity__ , who is of Czech:__entity__ extraction , as the United:__entity__ States:__entity__ ' first woman Secretary of State .
In a statement Havel:__entity__ , who is recovering from cancer surgery , said : " Madeleine:__entity__ Albright:__entity__ is a distinguished friend , a tested diplomat , and a true American:__entity__ of fine origins . "
" I look forward to continuing our good relations ...
with the United:__entity__ States:__entity__ and with the first woman ever to hold the position of Secretary of State .
I wish her well , " Havel:__entity__ said in a statement to Reuters:__entity__ .
Havel:__entity__ , who helped lead the " velvet:__entity__ revolution:__entity__ " that ousted the Communist:__entity__ regime in Prague:__entity__ in 1989 , invited Albright:__entity__ , then working for a private foreign policy think tank , to advise his new democratic government in 1990 .
Havel:__entity__ had a small malignant tumour removed from his lung on Monday and is recovering in hospital .
Albright:__entity__ , born Marie:__entity__ Korbelova:__entity__ to a Czechoslovak:__entity__ diplomat in 1937 , fled with her family to the United:__entity__ States:__entity__ after the Communists:__entity__ came to power in a coup in 1948 .
As an academic , Albright:__entity__ studied and lectured on Europe:__entity__ 's 20th century problems before becoming U.S.:__entity__ ambassador to the United:__entity__ Nations:__entity__ .
Czech:__entity__ diplomats , seeking to have their country included in the expected expansion of NATO:__entity__ , praised the selection of Albright:__entity__ , known to be a strong supporter of alliance 's integration of former Soveit-bloc:__entity__ countries .
" The nomination ...
is a clear signal that one key of the lines of foreign policy will be the strengthening of the trans-Atlantic:__entity__ cooperation , a creation of strategic partnership between Europe:__entity__ and the US:__entity__ , " Foreign Minister Josef:__entity__ Zieleniec:__entity__ told Reuters:__entity__ .
" ( Albright:__entity__ ) is a convinced advocate of NATO:__entity__ enlargement and of stabilisation of security structures . "
Czech:__entity__ ambassador to the United:__entity__ Nations:__entity__ , Karel:__entity__ Kovanda:__entity__ , told the daily Mlada:__entity__ Fronta:__entity__ Dnes:__entity__ that Albright:__entity__ " is a little light in our diplomatic heaven , " but warned against expecting her to exert any influence in favour of the Czechs:__entity__ .

CZECH:__entity__ VICE-PM SEES WIDER DEBATE AT PARTY CONGRESS:__entity__ .
PRAGUE:__entity__ 1996-12-06
Saturday 's national congress of the ruling Czech:__entity__ Civic:__entity__ Democratic:__entity__ Party:__entity__ ( ODS:__entity__ ) will discuss making the party more efficient and transparent , Foreign Minister and ODS:__entity__ vice-chairman Josef:__entity__ Zieleniec:__entity__ , said on Friday .
" Modernisation and more profesionalism of the party 's structure , having financing of the party be more transparent ...
are absolutely fundamental , " Zieleniec:__entity__ , who is also vice-premier in the government , told Reuters:__entity__ .
He said after June general elections in which the ruling three-party coalition lost its parliamentary majority , the ODS:__entity__ executive , led by Prime Minister Vaclav:__entity__ Klaus:__entity__ , had developed proposals on these subjects to present at the congress on Saturday in the Czech:__entity__ second city Brno:__entity__ .
" I am convinced , that the congress will tackle these proposals , " he said .
The ODS:__entity__ , a party in which Klaus:__entity__ often tries to emulate the style of former British:__entity__ Prime Minister Margaret:__entity__ Thatcher:__entity__ , has been in control of Czech:__entity__ politics since winning general elections in 1992 .
Zieleniec:__entity__ in the summer led calls for the party and its leadership to listen to more diverse opinions , a thinly-veiled criticism of Klaus:__entity__ who has spearheaded the country 's post-Communist:__entity__ economic reforms .
The party , led by the vigorously-confident Klaus:__entity__ , took 32 of 81 seats after late November runoff elections to the new upper house of Czech:__entity__ parliament .
But after the first round vote a week before , the ODS:__entity__ had the potential to win as many 79 seats .
Klaus:__entity__ and his coalition lost its majority in parliament in June lower house elections after the left-wing opposition consolidated , putting the centre-left Social:__entity__ Democrats:__entity__ in a strong second-place position .

POLAND:__entity__ GOT MONEY FROM POST-WAR SWISS:__entity__ ACCOUNTS .
Marcin:__entity__ Grajewski:__entity__
WARSAW:__entity__ 1996-12-06
Poland:__entity__ said on Friday that Swiss:__entity__ bank accounts , which in many cases belonged to Polish:__entity__ Jews:__entity__ who died in the Holocaust:__entity__ , were used in debt settlements between the two countries after the World:__entity__ War:__entity__ Two:__entity__ .
Foreign Minister Dariusz:__entity__ Rosati:__entity__ , unveiling first findings of a special government commission , said that in 1970s the then communist Poland:__entity__ received 460,000 Swiss:__entity__ francs from the accounts .
" In 1970s , Poland:__entity__ received from unclaimed accounts in Switzerland:__entity__ a sum of 460,000 francs .
What was its right ( to the money ) ...I do not know , " Rosati:__entity__ told a news conference .
Switzerland:__entity__ stands accused by Senator Alfonse:__entity__ D'Amato:__entity__ , chairman of the powerful U.S.:__entity__ Senate:__entity__ Banking:__entity__ Committee:__entity__ , of agreeing to give money to Poland:__entity__ from unclaimed bank accounts of Polish:__entity__ citizens , as part of an accord on compensating Swiss:__entity__ nationals whose assets had been seized in communist Poland:__entity__ .
Many of these citizens were Jews:__entity__ murdered during the war , when Nazi:__entity__ German:__entity__ invaders killed most of Poland:__entity__ 's 3.5 million Jews:__entity__ .
Rosati:__entity__ did not say whether the payment in 1970s was part of the 1949 agreement between Warsaw:__entity__ and Switzerland:__entity__ on compensation to Swiss:__entity__ citizens whose assets were seized by the Soviet-imposed:__entity__ communists authorities after World:__entity__ War:__entity__ Two:__entity__ .
" I expect that the commission will finish gathering information within two to three weeks and then more details will be provided , " Rosati:__entity__ said .
Rosati:__entity__ confirmed that the 1949 agreement had provided for granting Switzerland:__entity__ about 53 million francs and most of this sum was repaid with coal exports .
He said , however , that Switzerland:__entity__ did get about 16,000 francs from the so-called " dead accounts " as part of the compensation .
" About 16,000 francs were seized from accounts of four or five Polish:__entity__ citizens , whose data we do not precisely know .
The issue is of moral and legal nature , because its financial significance is small , " Rosati:__entity__ said .
Under pressure from international Jewish:__entity__ organisations , Swiss:__entity__ government has devised a plan to pay out millions of dollars in unclaimed bank accounts as a conciliatory gesture toward Holocaust:__entity__ victims .
The conservative Radical:__entity__ Democrats:__entity__ ( FDP:__entity__ ) have said they would ask parliament next week to order Swiss:__entity__ banks to put some 40 million Swiss:__entity__ francs ( $ 31 million ) in dormant wealth into a fund earmarked for Jewish:__entity__ groups and charitable organisations .
But Swiss:__entity__ banks and the country 's Jewish:__entity__ community voiced doubts whether the plan would work .

INTERVIEW-ZYWIEC:__entity__ SEES NO BIG 97 NET RISE .
Steven:__entity__ Silber:__entity__
WARSAW:__entity__ 1996-12-06
Polish:__entity__ brewer Zywiec:__entity__ 's 1996 profit slump may last into next year due in part to hefty depreciation charges , but recent high investment should help the firm defend its 10-percent market share , the firm 's chief executive said .
Company President Jean:__entity__ van:__entity__ Boxmeer:__entity__ told Reuters:__entity__ in an interview on Friday that the firm , whose net profit fell 77 percent in the first 10 months of 1996 despite a 30-percent rise in sales , might only post slightly better profits in 1997 before having a chance to make a more significant turnaround .
So far this year Zywiec:__entity__ , whose full name is Zaklady:__entity__ Piwowarskie:__entity__ w:__entity__ Zywcu:__entity__ SA:__entity__ , has netted six million zlotys on sales of 224 million zlotys .
It has produced 1.5 million hectolitres .
Van:__entity__ Boxmeer:__entity__ would not say how much higher 1997 profits or market share could be but said sales of leading Polish:__entity__ brewers should rise as the country 's young urban professionals gradually switch from vodka to beer .
" The perspective on growth is such that reasonably we can think that somewhere between 65 and 80 litres per year is certainly reachable , " van:__entity__ Boxmeer:__entity__ said on Polish:__entity__ per-capita beer consumption , currently around 40 litres .
He said the 65-80-litre level could be reached in the next ten years and make Poland:__entity__ , with its 40-million population , Europe:__entity__ 's third largest beer market after Germany:__entity__ and Britain:__entity__ .
Van:__entity__ Boxmeer:__entity__ said Poland:__entity__ 's top five brewers , which produce about 55 percent of the country 's beer , could all raise market share as some of the numerous small brewers fall to competition from the large brewers with foreign investors .
Zywiec:__entity__ is 31.8-percent owned by Heineken:__entity__ while Carlsberg:__entity__ has the same amount in Okocim:__entity__ .
Earlier this year South:__entity__ African:__entity__ Breweries:__entity__ Ltd:__entity__ ( SAB:__entity__ ) bought strategic stakes in the unlisted Lech:__entity__ and Tychy:__entity__ brewers , which together hold more than 20 percent of the market , and Australia:__entity__ 's Brewpole:__entity__ BV:__entity__ has a controlling stake in Poland:__entity__ 's larges t brewery , Elbrewery:__entity__ Company:__entity__ Ltd.:__entity__ ( EB:__entity__ ) .
Van:__entity__ Boxmeer:__entity__ said the tough competition had prevented Zywiec:__entity__ from raising prices in line with inflation , which had added to the pressure on the firm 's margins .
He said advertising costs would also increase in the fight for market share .
But he said the company 's investment of more than $ 100 million already this decade , largely in production , would help position it to compete with such competitors as brewers from the neighbouring Czech:__entity__ Republic:__entity__ .
Some analysts say cheaper but high-quality Czech:__entity__ imports could invade Poland:__entity__ once tariffs for CEFTA:__entity__ countries are lifted in 1998 , but van:__entity__ Boxmeer:__entity__ says such a threat might be exaggerated despite the Czech:__entity__ beer market 's overcapacity .
" I think Polish:__entity__ consumers in general are quite proud of their beers -- and I 'm speaking about all the brands -- and as we make good beers ...
I think that this fidelity to our beers is a factor which can limit the Czech:__entity__ beers , " he said .
Van:__entity__ Boxmeer:__entity__ said Zywiec:__entity__ had its eye on Okocim:__entity__ , which has said it would start producing Carlsberg:__entity__ beer next year , but that Zywiec:__entity__ 's potential production of Heineken:__entity__ was a medium-term possibility rather than a short-term one .
He said his firm would be better off concentrating on its leading brand , Zywiec:__entity__ Full:__entity__ Light:__entity__ , which accounts for 85 percent of sales and is the country 's largest-selling brand .
" You will not win the war of the Polish:__entity__ beer market with imported international brands , " van:__entity__ Boxmeer:__entity__ said , adding that Heineken:__entity__ would remain an up-market import in Poland:__entity__ .
Van:__entity__ Boxmeer:__entity__ also said Zywiec:__entity__ would be boosted by its recent shedding of soft drinks which only accounted for about three percent of the firm 's overall sales and for which 7.6 million zlotys in provisions had already been made .

Britain:__entity__ sets conditions to clear American:__entity__ alliance .
Edna:__entity__ Fernandes:__entity__
LONDON:__entity__ 1996-12-06
The British:__entity__ government warned Friday that it would refer the proposed trans-Atlantic:__entity__ alliance between British:__entity__ Airways:__entity__ Plc:__entity__ and American:__entity__ Airlines:__entity__ to Britain:__entity__ 's Monopolies:__entity__ and:__entity__ Mergers:__entity__ Commission:__entity__ unless the carriers complied with a number of conditions .
Trade:__entity__ and:__entity__ Industry:__entity__ Secretary Ian:__entity__ Lang:__entity__ added that even if the conditions were met by both airlines , final clearance would hinge on an open skies deal between Britain:__entity__ and the United:__entity__ States:__entity__ to liberalise trans-Atlantic:__entity__ air traffic , which would create greater competition on the routes .
Lang:__entity__ said he supported conditions proposed by Britain:__entity__ 's Office:__entity__ of:__entity__ Fair:__entity__ Trading:__entity__ , which was asked to examine the case last month .
" I agree ... that without suitable undertakings the alliance would be likely to lead to a significant loss of actual and potential passengers , on those routes where BA:__entity__ and AA:__entity__ currently compete and for all passengers on the trans-Atlantic:__entity__ market route between the UK:__entity__ and U.S.:__entity__ , " he said .
His comments came just minutes after the latest set of open skies talks ended in London:__entity__ with no deal signed .
Industry sources said there was no new date for fresh talks and blamed the deadlock on uncertainty over whether the British:__entity__ Airways-American:__entity__ deal would be cleared .
The conditions for clearance of the alliance were that British:__entity__ Airways:__entity__ and American:__entity__ drop 168 slots at London:__entity__ Heathrow:__entity__ airport , the busiest in Europe:__entity__ .
American:__entity__ 's parent , AMR:__entity__ Corp.:__entity__ , said it did not view the terms as a " deal breaker . "
However , it called the conditions " more severe " than those imposed by other regulatory authorities on similar airline alliances .
British:__entity__ Airways:__entity__ 's initial response was that " unconditional divestiture of slots is unprecedented and if done it must be on the basis of fair market value . "
It added that it would be " prepared to take reasonable steps to assist the introduction of additional competition . "
The government also wants British:__entity__ Airways:__entity__ to drop a clause in its agreement with USAir:__entity__ that bars it from competing on trans-Atlantic:__entity__ routes , and said both British:__entity__ Airways:__entity__ and American:__entity__ should be prepared to reduce services on the London:__entity__ to Dallas-Fort:__entity__ Worth:__entity__ route in the event that a new entrant wishes to enter .
It also suggested losing some slots on the London-to-Boston:__entity__ route .
The Office:__entity__ of:__entity__ Fair:__entity__ Trade:__entity__ called for British:__entity__ Airways:__entity__ / American:__entity__ to allow third-party access to their joint frequent flyer programme where the applicant does not have access to an equivalent programme .
Lang:__entity__ said responses should be made to the Office:__entity__ of:__entity__ Fair:__entity__ Trading:__entity__ by Jan. 10 , 1997 .

Med:__entity__ oil products mostly lower as Elf:__entity__ strike ends .
LONDON:__entity__ 1996-12-06
Mediterranean:__entity__ oil products were steady to mostly lower on Friday after Elf:__entity__ refinery workers voted to end their nine-day strike .
Gas oil erased Thursday 's gains , plunging $ 5.50 a tonne in line with the screen .
Volume was very thin and market remained long , with premiums down $ 1 at about high cif quotes +$0.50 basis Genoa:__entity__ . "
The sharp moves on the screen make everyone nervous , " a trader said .
Trades were discussed in 0.2 , 0.5 and one percent heating oil into Syria:__entity__ and Lebanon:__entity__ and there were fresh inquiries from France:__entity__ and Spain:__entity__ for low sulphur diesel .
Interest remains focussed on a tender by India:__entity__ for a second purchase of high speed diesel for January delivery .
Fuel oil lost ground sharply with weaker crude , but also suffered from some pricing pressure .
High sulphur cracked fuel lost about $ 3 to $ 109-111 fob Med:__entity__ with several cargoes threatening to overhang the market .
The chance of material heading north , talked earlier this week , may be in jeopardy now since American:__entity__ fuel oil is expected to head transatlantic following outages at two coking units in the U.S:__entity__ .
Up to 165,000 tonnes of fuel will have to find a new home and with the arbitrage from the U.S.:__entity__ to Europe:__entity__ open Rotterdam:__entity__ is a prime candidate .
Low sulphur prices were lower with cif Med:__entity__ pegged in the mid to low $ 140s .
Gasoline prices fell after striking Elf:__entity__ refinery workers voted to go back to work , traders said .
But an open arbitrage to the U.S.:__entity__ and tight Italian:__entity__ supplies after Elf:__entity__ scooped up Med:__entity__ material over the last week , continued to underpin prices into next week .

LONDON:__entity__ 1996-12-06
A boy has died from meningitis and a girl from the same school has contracted the disease in the second such scare to hit Britain:__entity__ in as many weeks , health authorities said on Friday .
The 16-year-old who attended Sale:__entity__ Grammar:__entity__ School:__entity__ in the northern England:__entity__ city of Manchester:__entity__ died less than a day after becoming ill .
The 15-year-old girl is also suffering from the disease and hospital officials described her condition as serious .
" At the moment there is no evidence the two cases are linked .
However , we are assuming they are as a precaution for the time being , " a spokeswoman said .
The more than 1,260 students at the school are being given antibiotics as a precaution .
Wales:__entity__ grappled with its own cluster of meningitis cases on a university campus in Cardiff:__entity__ .
At least two people have died and hundreds have been vaccinated in an effort to contain the virus .
In Scotland:__entity__ , eight people have died and hundreds more are fighting a widespread food-poisoning outbreak .

NYC:__entity__ Jan refunding has its 1st Euro:__entity__ floating rate .
NEW:__entity__ YORK:__entity__ 1996-12-06
New:__entity__ York:__entity__ City:__entity__ on Friday said that it planned a $ 775 million refunding for January that will include its first floating rate issue of taxable debt for European:__entity__ investors .
A city official , who declined to be named , explained that Goldman:__entity__ ,:__entity__ Sachs:__entity__ , which this summer was demoted to the second tier of the syndicate , proposed the floating rate issue and as a result was promoted to book runner for this offering .
By selling the floating rate debt , the city hopes to establish a benchmark , the city official said , adding that it needed a large deal to accomplish this objective .
The city in late June sold its first issue of Euronotes:__entity__ , a strategy that it says saved it $ 500,000 in interest costs , and it has been trying to build on this strategy of expanding the pool of potential investors since then .
In November , New:__entity__ York:__entity__ City:__entity__ said it became the first U.S.:__entity__ municipality to offer bonds for sale in European:__entity__ markets by competitive bidding as it listed taxable bonds on the London:__entity__ Stock:__entity__ Exchange:__entity__ .
The refunding planned for January also includes a $ 475 million tax-exempt offering .
No specific date in January has been selected for the debt sale , the official added .

Wall:__entity__ St:__entity__ speculates about Santa:__entity__ Fe:__entity__ savior .
Brendan:__entity__ Intindola:__entity__
NEW:__entity__ YORK:__entity__ 1996-12-06
Homestake:__entity__ Mining:__entity__ Co:__entity__ tops Wall:__entity__ Street:__entity__ 's list as the most likely white knight buyer for Santa:__entity__ Fe:__entity__ Pacific:__entity__ Gold:__entity__ Corp:__entity__ if Santa:__entity__ Fe:__entity__ rejects unsolicited suitor Newmont:__entity__ Mining:__entity__ Corp:__entity__ .
Santa:__entity__ Fe:__entity__ is so far mum on the more than $ 2 billion stock swap takeover proposal from Newmont:__entity__ , announced Thursday .
Wall:__entity__ Street:__entity__ , since the bid , has speculated that any deal between Newmont:__entity__ and Santa:__entity__ Fe:__entity__ would be a " bear hug , " or a reluctantly negotiated agreement where the buyer is not necessarily a friendly suitor .
Newmont:__entity__ said the companies have had previous contact , though declined to detail the encounters .
Analysts predict Santa:__entity__ Fe:__entity__ will go to the highest bidder , and that if a rival buyer is found , Newmont:__entity__ may not be able to match its offer .
They said the Santa:__entity__ Fe:__entity__ deal , which includes desirable Nevada:__entity__ mining territory , would only payoff for Newmont:__entity__ longer term .
Newmont:__entity__ , in fact , will not benefit from the Santa:__entity__ Fe:__entity__ acquisition on an earnings basis for at least two years , which also limits its capacity to raise its offer .
Any deal , friendly or hostile , would almost assuredly be a stock swap , which is necessary to preserve the tax-free , pooling-of-interest accounting , they said .
Analysts and arbitrageurs immediately ruled out Barrick:__entity__ Gold:__entity__ Corp:__entity__ and Bre-X:__entity__ Minerals:__entity__ Ltd:__entity__ as Santa:__entity__ Fe:__entity__ saviors because they are locked in negotiations over their splitting Indonesia:__entity__ 's Busang:__entity__ vast gold deposit .
Placer:__entity__ Dome:__entity__ Inc:__entity__ too was considered unlikley because it is focusing on geographic expansion in areas that do match Santa:__entity__ Fe:__entity__ 's Nevada:__entity__ , South:__entity__ America:__entity__ and Central:__entity__ Asia:__entity__ presence , they said .
A Homestake:__entity__ spokesman was not immediately available to comment on speculation that it tops the list .
Homestake:__entity__ , based in San:__entity__ Francisco:__entity__ , operates gold mines in the United:__entity__ States:__entity__ , Australia:__entity__ , Chile:__entity__ and Canada:__entity__ .
Earnings in 1995 were $ 0.22 per share , or $ 30.3 million , on revenues of $ 746.3 million .
Santa:__entity__ Fe:__entity__ is headquartered Albuquerque:__entity__ , N.M.:__entity__ and reported 1995 earnings of $ 0.30 per share , or $ 40 million , on revenues of $ 350 million .
Santa:__entity__ Fe:__entity__ has mining and exploration operations in Nevada:__entity__ , California:__entity__ , Montana:__entity__ , Canada:__entity__ , Brazil:__entity__ , Australia:__entity__ , Chile:__entity__ , Kazakstan:__entity__ , Mexico:__entity__ and Ghana:__entity__ .
PaineWebber:__entity__ analyst Marc:__entity__ Cohen:__entity__ said he lowered his rating on Newmont:__entity__ to neutral from attractive today because if Newmont:__entity__ merged with Santa:__entity__ Fe:__entity__ , investors would have to wait until the second half of 1998 to realize earnings accretion .
" I think Homestake:__entity__ could come in as a white knight , but how much is someone willing to come in above the Newmont:__entity__ number .
One would have to outbid by at least 15 percent , but there is going to be a ( Santa:__entity__ Fe:__entity__ ) deal with someone , " he said .
" Longer term , two to three years out , ( a Newmont-Santa:__entity__ Fe:__entity__ deal ) is positive , it does all the right things .
But in the near-term it is , at worst , neutral , " the analyst added .
Newmont:__entity__ proposed to Santa:__entity__ Fe:__entity__ a stock-swap merger at a ratio of 0.33 Newmont:__entity__ shares for each Santa:__entity__ Fe:__entity__ shares .
In Friday New:__entity__ York:__entity__ Stock:__entity__ Exchange:__entity__ trade , Newmonth:__entity__ was off 1/2 to 46-5/8 while Santa:__entity__ Fe:__entity__ added 1/4 to 15-1/8 .
" Newmont:__entity__ said it wants to discuss a friendly deal with Santa:__entity__ Fe:__entity__ , which is almost always a euphemism for ' We have more money in our pocket , ' " said an arb , referring to a possible sweetened bid from Newmont:__entity__ .
Two other arbs called Newmont:__entity__ 's move a " a 32 cent bid " because there is no formal tender offer , only the proposal letter " mailed " to Santa:__entity__ Fe:__entity__ 's board .

Multinational commander going back to east Zaire:__entity__ .
Jonathan:__entity__ Wright:__entity__
NAIROBI:__entity__ 1996-12-06
The Canadian:__entity__ general in charge of a multinational force for eastern Zaire:__entity__ said on Friday he was going back to Zaire:__entity__ for more information about the plight of about 165,000 Rwandan:__entity__ refugees adrift in the countryside .
Lieutenant-General Maurice:__entity__ Baril:__entity__ told a news conference in Nairobi:__entity__ his main concern was for a large group of about 150,000 refugees living off the land in a valley about 65 km ( 40 miles ) west of the eastern city of Goma:__entity__ .
If he decided it was necessary and safe for the aircrew , he would not hesitate to order airdrops of food for the refugees , even against the wishes of the government in Kinshasa:__entity__ and the Zairean:__entity__ rebels who control much of eastern Zaire:__entity__ , he said .
" Tomorrow I 'm going into Rwanda:__entity__ and my intention is to go across into eastern Zaire:__entity__ and try to find out for the second time what the situation is on the ground , " he said .
General Baril:__entity__ saw rebel leader Laurent:__entity__ Kabila:__entity__ in Goma:__entity__ last week but the rebels told him the crisis was over because most of the Rwandan:__entity__ refugees have already gone home .
The rebels do not want the multinational force to deploy on the ground , for fear it might help the Zairean:__entity__ army regain control of the area .
Kinshasa:__entity__ opposes airdrops , apparently because the food could fall into the hands of the rebels and their local supporters .
Canadian:__entity__ Defence Minister Doug:__entity__ Young:__entity__ said on Thursday that the multinational force would probably not have to make food airdrops or intervene militarily in any major way .
" It does n't look as though they ( airdrops ) are going to be required in any significant way because the NGOs ( non-governmental organisations ) are in that area on the border between Zaire:__entity__ and Rwanda:__entity__ , " Young:__entity__ told reporters .
But General Baril:__entity__ said it would be premature to rule out any course of action until he had more information .
" We hope that if the front moves forward or stabilises then we will have access ( to the large group of refugees ) with reconnaissance or humanitarian agencies .
" If they ca n't move because they are too weak , then we will probably consider very seriously using air delivery means ( airdrops ) ...It 's complex , it 's dangerous for the air crew that fly in there and it will have to be absolutely necessary .
If it is necessary , I wo n't hesitate to use it , " he said .
Asked if he would disregard the objections of the Zairean:__entity__ government , he said : " It would have to be in the last resort .
It would have to mean that tens of thousands of lives are in danger .
Do you think that I would have a conscience problem doing it or not at that time ?
And my mandate is also under Chapter:__entity__ Seven:__entity__ to operate in eastern Zaire:__entity__ . "
Under Chapter:__entity__ Seven:__entity__ of the U.N.:__entity__ charter , the Security:__entity__ Council:__entity__ has wide powers to preserve peace and security .
" I know their ( the Zairean:__entity__ government 's ) position and I know it 's very delicate and we are very sensitive to their position also , " the general added .
He denied that his contacts , criticised by Kinshasa:__entity__ , with the Zairean:__entity__ rebels amounted to negotiations .
" I do n't negotiate , " he said . "
I coordinate with those who are holding ground and that 's a wise thing to do .
When we do n't know where the front is , we do n't know what the risk is . "
Baril:__entity__ said that apart from the group of 150,000 , U.S.:__entity__ and British:__entity__ reconnaissance plans had tracked two much smaller groups of refugees -- one of up to 1,000 north of the town of Masisi:__entity__ and one of up to 8,000 on the road from Bukavu:__entity__ west to Kindu:__entity__ .
The Kisangani:__entity__ office of the medical charity Medecins:__entity__ sans:__entity__ Frontieres:__entity__ said on Friday that more than 100,000 refugees were trekking northwest from the Goma-Bukavu:__entity__ area and many of them were now in the town of Walikale:__entity__ .
The general did not mention these refugees , who are on the outer limit of the strip the planes have been checking .

" France:__entity__ cannot be involved in the domestic political debate , " President Jacques:__entity__ Chirac:__entity__ told a news conference at the end of a Franco-African:__entity__ summit in Burkina:__entity__ Faso:__entity__ .
" French:__entity__ troops may only take part in maintaining order to avoid major abuses and protect foreign communities , " he said .
Public Service Minister David:__entity__ Dofara:__entity__ , who is the head of the national Red:__entity__ Cross:__entity__ , told Reuters:__entity__ he had seen the bodies of former interior minister Christophe:__entity__ Grelombe:__entity__ and his son , who was not named .
Witnesses said they had been seized by troops loyal to President Ange-Felix:__entity__ Patasse:__entity__ at dawn on Thursday when they clashed with soldiers staging a mutiny since November 16 .
Grelombe:__entity__ is from the Yakoma:__entity__ tribe to which most of the rebel soldiers belong .
The uprising began over pay demands but has turned into a campaign to topple Patasse:__entity__ , sparking ethnic violence and dividing the capital .
The former minister and his son had been taken from their home close to the presidential palace , which is guarded by loyalist soldiers backed by French:__entity__ troops based in Bangui:__entity__ .
The bodies were found on Thursday in an open field about two km ( one mile ) further away , said Dofora:__entity__ and other witnesses .
The men were seized as loyalist forces and French:__entity__ troops fought gunbattles with mutineers who fired rockets into the city centre .
A French-owned:__entity__ hotel was slightly damaged .
Yakomas:__entity__ are hounded in stronghold districts of Patasse:__entity__ 's Baya:__entity__ people while other tribes have fled areas in rebel hands .
Roadblocks have been erected in city districts while central Bangui:__entity__ , which is patrolled by French:__entity__ troops with tanks , is deserted .
Shops and businesses have remained shut this week .
The Franco-African:__entity__ summit decided to send a mission Bangui:__entity__ to seek ways of containing the mutiny and a threat of civil war .
Chirac:__entity__ said Burkina:__entity__ Faso:__entity__ President Blaise:__entity__ Compaore:__entity__ would visit Bangui:__entity__ " in the coming hours " with the heads of state of Gabon:__entity__ , Mali:__entity__ and Chad:__entity__ to try and establish dialogue between authorities and rebels .
The mutiny forced Patasse:__entity__ to miss the summit .
His spokesman had predicted the meeting to send an assessment mission .
Patasse:__entity__ , who won Central:__entity__ Africa:__entity__ 's first multi-party elections , refuses to resign .
Church-led meadiation attempts hit deadlock over rebel demands for his departure .
Soldiers staged mutinies in April and May , with French:__entity__ troops stepping in with tanks and helicopters to quell the more serious second uprising .
Patasse:__entity__ offered concessions and amnesty to rebels before the May rebellion ended after rebels looted the city centre .
Rebels accuse Patasse:__entity__ of tribalism and of arming his civilian supporters and hired guns from Sudan:__entity__ and Chad:__entity__ .
Mutineers have vowed to disarm all civilians and to chase out the foreign forces knwon as Codos:__entity__ .
Hospital sources and witnesses said about 10 people were known to have been killed in the more than two weeks of fighting , including two rebels killed in Thursday 's clashes .
An undetermined number of people are reported to have been abducted and killed outside the town by tribal vigilante groups .
In Thursday 's fighting , French:__entity__ troops fired back as mutineers trying to break out of their strongholds rained mortar shells on the city centre .

An Albanian:__entity__ court on Friday sentenced a man who threatened to blow himself up outside President Sali:__entity__ Berisha:__entity__ 's office to 13 years in jail for guerrilla action and illegal possession of arms .
Buza:__entity__ last April said he would blow himself up outside the presidential palace unless he was allowed to speak to Berisha:__entity__ , who was at the time meeting Italian:__entity__ President Oscar:__entity__ Luigi:__entity__ Scalfaro:__entity__ .
Buza:__entity__ was overpowered by riot police less than one hour after he began his action .
" Evaluating all the conditions of the case the court thinks the sentence should be lower than the minimum ( 15 years ) , " Tirana:__entity__ judge Qazim:__entity__ Gjonaj:__entity__ added .
The defendant denied the charges , saying his action was intended to urge the authorities to give him a $ 20,000 loan .

Polish:__entity__ ex-communist president to visit Pope .
WARSAW:__entity__ 1996-12-06
Poland:__entity__ 's ex-communist President Aleksander:__entity__ Kwasniewski:__entity__ is likely to visit Polish-born:__entity__ Pope John:__entity__ Paul:__entity__ in early 1997 despite uneasy relations between the Vatican:__entity__ and Warsaw:__entity__ , the foreign minister said on Friday .
" President Kwasniewski:__entity__ plans to visit Italy:__entity__ on a invitation from President Oscar:__entity__ Scalfaro:__entity__ .
A meeting with the Pope is also planned , " Dariusz:__entity__ Rosati:__entity__ told a news conference .
Rosati:__entity__ said that the atmosphere of the meeting , if it takes place , would largely depend on the progress in talks on ratification of a treaty between Warsaw:__entity__ and the Vatican:__entity__ .
@
The ratification of the treaty , which was signed in 1993 by the then right-centrist government , is being delayed by an ex-communist party , which won parliamentary elections in the same year and now dominates parliament .
The party , the Democratic:__entity__ Left:__entity__ Alliance:__entity__ , says the agreement would give the Catholic:__entity__ Church:__entity__ too much influence over life in Poland:__entity__ and could infringe on rights of other religious groups and non-believers .
The relations with the Vatican:__entity__ have also been soured by a recent relaxation of Poland:__entity__ 's anti-abortion rules , which Kwasniewski:__entity__ signed into law last month .

Russia:__entity__ warns Norilsk:__entity__ , not expected to liquidate it .

MOSCOW:__entity__ 1996-12-06
Russian:__entity__ Finance Minister Alexander:__entity__ Livshits:__entity__ warned financially-troubled Norilsk:__entity__ Nickel:__entity__ on Friday that it must pay overdue taxes , but analysts said the firm would not be liquidated or that its would assets would be frozen .
" Norilsk:__entity__ really is a big debtor , both to the federal and regional budgets , " said Konstantin:__entity__ Chernyshev:__entity__ , equities analyst at Moscow:__entity__ brokerage Rinaco:__entity__ Plus:__entity__ and a Norilsk:__entity__ watcher . "
Livshits:__entity__ 's words are an attempt to put pressure on the company . "
The official Itar-Tass:__entity__ news agency quoted Livshits:__entity__ as telling parliamentary deputies that RAO:__entity__ Norilsky:__entity__ Nikel:__entity__ 0#NKEL.RUO had to pay its tax arrears and that bankruptcy procedures applied to the metals group .
" If it was an unsolicited statement and a bolt out of the blue , then it obviously means something , " said Christopher:__entity__ Granville:__entity__ , chief economist at United:__entity__ City:__entity__ Bank:__entity__ in Moscow:__entity__ .
" But if it was a response to a deputy 's question that was essentially loaded , then it was the only answer he could have given . "
Russian:__entity__ tax and cabinet authorities , under pressure from the International:__entity__ Monetary:__entity__ Fund:__entity__ to boost tax revenues as a condition for receiving payments of a $ 10 billion , three-year loan to Moscow:__entity__ , have been striking fear into the hearts of some of Russia:__entity__ 's most prominent industrial firms by saying they must pay up or face liquidation .
" They could freeze metal , but it 's not a long-term solution to the problem and would n't put money in the budget , " Chernyshev:__entity__ said . "
I do n't think they would do that . "
Entire social infrastructures in the icy Far:__entity__ North:__entity__ where Norilsk:__entity__ is based depend on the company , and Moscow:__entity__ has said it has no finances to resettle hundreds of thousands of people -- an expenditure which could far outstrip Norilsk:__entity__ 's debts .
Norilsk:__entity__ officials declined to comment .
Analysts said the government , while anxious about Norilsk:__entity__ 's debts , is highly unlikely to bring the nickel , copper , cobalt , platinum and platinum group metals producer to its knees or take measures that could significantly affect output .
But it also wants Norilsk:__entity__ , the world 's second-largest nickel producer , to clean up its act .
" The procedure of bankruptcy will be applied , " Tass:__entity__ quoted Livshits:__entity__ as telling Duma:__entity__ deputies about Norilsk:__entity__ .
It indirectly quoted him as saying Norilsk:__entity__ should first pay salary arrears , which in the past have led to worker strikes .
" It is unlikely that Norilsk:__entity__ will pay these debts in the near-term -- the company will remain a debtor in the near future , " Chernyshev:__entity__ said .
He estimated the company 's regional debts at least one trillion roubles and said 30 percent of the giant Krasnoyarsk:__entity__ regional budget was fuelled by Norilsk:__entity__ money .
Norilsk:__entity__ 's new majority shareholder , Russian:__entity__ commerical bank Uneximbank:__entity__ , has said it is reorganising metal exports through Interrosimpex:__entity__ in order to boost revenues .
But the changes have yet to improve significantly Norilsk:__entity__ 's situation .
" Uneximbank:__entity__ has inherited a mountain and whether or not they climb out and over it remains to be seen , " said one metals source .
Norilsk:__entity__ said in September that it total debts , including unpaid salaries to workers , were 13 trillion roubles .
The company said last month that it had worked out a tax payment schedule with authorities , after regional tax officials threatened to seize some nickel and copper assets .

The blue-chip IPC:__entity__ index ended down 1.29 points , or 43.56 percent , at 3,333.05 .
Volume was regular at 74.7 million shares traded .
Mexican:__entity__ stocks were also hurt by U.S.:__entity__ long bond rates which had begun to rise before Greenspan:__entity__ 's comments and were inflated by employment data released before trade began in Mexico:__entity__ .
Yields on U.S.:__entity__ 30-year Treasury:__entity__ bonds were 6.51 percent when stock trading closed in Mexico:__entity__ , unchanged from Thursday .
On the broad market , 107 stocks changed hands , of which losers well outnumbered winners by 75 to 13 .

Plastic surgery gets boost in Brazil:__entity__ .
Simona:__entity__ de:__entity__ Logu:__entity__
RIO:__entity__ DE:__entity__ JANEIRO:__entity__ 1996-12-06
Plastic surgery is booming , especially among men , as Brazilians:__entity__ spend much of their new-found wealth on the latest beauty treatments , said the organisers of a four-day international plastic surgery conference that opened on Friday .
The number of plastic surgeries in Brazil:__entity__ has jumped 30 percent to an estimated 150,000 this year since an anti-inflation plan was introduced in July 1994 , Farid:__entity__ Hakme:__entity__ , the president of the Brazilian:__entity__ Plastic:__entity__ Surgery:__entity__ Society:__entity__ ( SBCP:__entity__ ) , said .
The number of operations on men increased even more -- by 80 percent , from 8,000 in 1994 to 15,000 in 1995 , he said .
" Brazil:__entity__ ranks right at the top for plastic surgery with respect to the number of surgeons , the number of patients , number of operations , number of conferences .
Our statistics are the highest for everything , " Hakme:__entity__ said .
" We believe the increase in plastic surgeries for men results from the difficulties in the job market .
People need to have a more youthful look to compete in the job market , given the profound changes in Latin:__entity__ America:__entity__ 's economy . "
A controlled exchange rate , trade liberalisation and tight monetary policies have also dramatically curbed inflation , making more money available for cosmetic surgery .
Brazil:__entity__ has been at the forefront in plastic surgery for decades and is home to one of the most famous surgeons , Ivo:__entity__ Pitangy:__entity__ .
There are 6,000 plastic surgeons there , of which 4,500 have qualified to be members of the SBCP:__entity__ .
Every year , 500 new plastic surgeons graduate in Brazil:__entity__ and medical students from all over the world come to study there .
Hakme:__entity__ attributes Brazil:__entity__ 's fascination with plastic surgery not to excessive vanity but to the country 's mix and match of different races , which can create physical disharmonies . "
What happens is the nose sometimes does n't match the mouth or the buttocks do n't match with the legs , " he said .
Brazil:__entity__ 's most sought-after beauty treatment is liposuction in which fat is sucked away from areas of the body , with about 30,000 operations a year at a cost of $ 3,000 to $ 4,000 each .
Stomach tucks and breast operations are also popular since the tropical climate calls for flesh-baring fashions , but unlike women elsewhere Brazilians:__entity__ tend to have breast reductions and buttock implants .
" The women who want to reduce their breasts here would probably want to increase them in the United:__entity__ States:__entity__ , " SBCP:__entity__ Vice-President Oswaldo:__entity__ Saldanha:__entity__ said . "
Beauty ideals and cultures are different in every country . "
Plastic surgery scares like the case in which Brazilian:__entity__ model Claudia:__entity__ Liz:__entity__ fell into a coma after being anaesthetised for a liposuction in October are not much of a deterrent .
Saldanha:__entity__ said operations fell 30 percent immediately after that case but the rate was back to normal now .

The bishop will jointly receive the Nobel:__entity__ award next Tuesday with East:__entity__ Timorese-born:__entity__ activist Jose:__entity__ Ramos:__entity__ Horta:__entity__ , who lives in self-exile in Australia:__entity__ .
The Indonesian:__entity__ government has condemned the inclusion of Ramos:__entity__ Horta:__entity__ in the award , and Foreign Minister Ali:__entity__ Alatas:__entity__ said on Friday that Indonesia:__entity__ would not be represented officially at the ceremony in the Norwegian:__entity__ capital .
" I sincerely believe that this unfortunate choice in giving the honour to such a controversial figure as Ramos:__entity__ Horta:__entity__ ...
will exacerbate the problem in finding a solution ( to East:__entity__ Timor:__entity__ ) , " Alatas:__entity__ said on Friday .
He was responding to questions at a news conference called to discuss next week 's ministerial meeting of the Organisation:__entity__ of:__entity__ the:__entity__ Islamic:__entity__ Conference:__entity__ ( OIC:__entity__ ) in Jakarta:__entity__ .
Ramos:__entity__ Horta:__entity__ has been a vocal leader of the opposition to Jakarta:__entity__ 's rule in the territory .
Belo:__entity__ and Ramos:__entity__ Horta:__entity__ were awared the prize for their efforts to secure a peaceful solution to the issue of East:__entity__ Timor:__entity__ , a former Portuguese:__entity__ colony which Indonesia:__entity__ invaded in 1975 and annexed the following year .
The United:__entity__ Nations:__entity__ has never recognised Jakarta:__entity__ 's move .
Alatas:__entity__ said the government 's position on the Nobel:__entity__ Peace:__entity__ Prize:__entity__ would have been different if it had been awarded solely to Belo:__entity__ .
Asked if the Indonesian:__entity__ ambassador to Norway:__entity__ would have attended the ceremony if only Belo:__entity__ had been involved , Alatas:__entity__ replied : " Probably , yes , but that is a hypothetical question . "
Alatas:__entity__ said on Tuesday that on his way back from Oslo:__entity__ , Belo:__entity__ would visit the Vatican:__entity__ to see the Pope , and would also meet German:__entity__ Chancellor Helmut:__entity__ Kohl:__entity__ in Bonn:__entity__ .
Kohl:__entity__ had wanted to meet Belo:__entity__ during the chancellor 's official visit to Indonesia:__entity__ last month , but the bishop was too busy in East:__entity__ Timor:__entity__ to come to Jakarta:__entity__ .

Government disperses protest with water cannons .
RANGOON:__entity__ 1996-12-07
Burmese:__entity__ troops and riot police moved in to disperse a student street protest at a suburban road junction near the Ranyon:__entity__ (:__entity__ Rangoon:__entity__ ):__entity__ University:__entity__ early on Saturday , witnesses said .
They said police and troops used water cannons from fire engines to subdue about 120 university students sitting in at the centre of the junction at about 3 a.m. before they moved in to round them up .
The students , who had staged an 11-hour protest at the junction in northern Rangoon:__entity__ , were taken away in three vehicles .
The witnesses said some of the students were hit with batons while they were herded onto the vehicles and it was believed they were taken to the Insein:__entity__ prison in suburban Rangoon:__entity__ .
The protesting students , mostly from Rangoon:__entity__ University:__entity__ , were demanding the right to organise independent unions on campuses and the release of about 80 student leaders currently in jail .
They were among 500 students who started demonstrating at the intersection on late Friday afternoon .
The protest was the second major one in five days in the capital .

Burmese:__entity__ students march briefly out of campus .
Vithoon:__entity__ Amorn:__entity__
RANGOON:__entity__ 1996-12-06
About 200 Burmese:__entity__ students marched briefly from troubled Yangon:__entity__ Institute:__entity__ of:__entity__ Technology:__entity__ in northern Rangoon:__entity__ on Friday towards the University:__entity__ of:__entity__ Yangon:__entity__ six km ( four miles ) away , and returned to their campus , witnesses said .
Seven truckloads of armed riot police and three fire engines were on standby at one of the junctions near the institute .
There were no clashes .
" They are now back in the YIT:__entity__ campus , " an institute official who declined to be identified told Reuters:__entity__ by telephone .
One of two roads leading to the University:__entity__ of:__entity__ Yangon:__entity__ from the institute had been closed by authorities .
But about 300 university students were still gathered outside the gates of their campus , witnesses said .
They were singing peacefully .
On Monday and Tuesday , students from the institute and the university launched protests against what they said was unfair handling by police of a brawl between some of their colleagues and restaurant owners in October .
On Tuesday and Wednesday , opposition leader Aung:__entity__ San:__entity__ Suu:__entity__ Kyi:__entity__ was restricted to her home by the military government to prevent her from being drawn into the protests .
She was allowed to move freely on Thursday .
The protest culminated at dawn on Tuesday with several hundred students being detained briefly by police in central Rangoon:__entity__ .
The street protests were the biggest seen in the capital since the student-led pro-democracry demonstrations of September 1988 when the junta crushed the uprising .
Thousands were killed or imprisoned .
Earlier on Friday some of the students , who were held briefly by police during the protests earlier this week , said they were still dissatisfied with the military government .
They told Reuters:__entity__ they were unhappy that the ruling State:__entity__ Law:__entity__ and:__entity__ Order:__entity__ Restoration:__entity__ Council:__entity__ ( SLORC:__entity__ ) had not heeded their calls for the right to organise independent unions on campus .
" We still want government answers to our demands .
We want police punishment to be published in newspapers , " one student said .
But the students stressed their protests were non-political and they had no contact with Suu:__entity__ Kyi:__entity__ 's National:__entity__ League:__entity__ for:__entity__ Democracy:__entity__ ( NLD:__entity__ ) .
Suu:__entity__ Kyi:__entity__ , a Nobel:__entity__ laureate and daughter of independence hero Aung:__entity__ San:__entity__ , and key NLD:__entity__ officials have also denied any link with the students .
But they have said both parties had a " moral link " in that they were against police brutality and injustice .
The students also demanded the government announce punishments meted out to policemen who they said had manhandled students involved in a brawl with some restaurant owners near the Yangon:__entity__ institute in October .
The students appealed to the government not to close the institute because of their latest demonstration .
The institute was shut for nearly two years after the 1988 uprising .
On Friday , the road leading to Suu:__entity__ Kyi:__entity__ 's lakeside residence in central Rangoon:__entity__ remained closed by police .

Union:__entity__ leaders outraged by WTO:__entity__ snub to ILO:__entity__ head .
SINGAPORE:__entity__ 1996-12-06
International:__entity__ trade:__entity__ union:__entity__ leaders on Friday expressed outrage that the head of the International:__entity__ Labour:__entity__ Organisation:__entity__ ( ILO:__entity__ ) had been barred from speaking at next week 's WTO:__entity__ meeting in Singapore:__entity__ .
Bill:__entity__ Jordan:__entity__ , general secretary of the International:__entity__ Confederation:__entity__ of:__entity__ Free:__entity__ Trade:__entity__ Unions:__entity__ ( ICFTU:__entity__ ) , told a news conference the withdrawal of a WTO:__entity__ invitation to ILO:__entity__ director general Michel:__entity__ Hansenne:__entity__ was " outrageous behaviour on the part of an organisation that wants to command respect in the world " .
Jordan:__entity__ said a small group of developing nations that oppose linking trade talks and labour conditions had pressured World:__entity__ Trade:__entity__ Organisation:__entity__ ( WTO:__entity__ ) officials to prevent Hansenne:__entity__ from taking the platform to urge such links .
" It is to their shame that those who are responsible for encouraging this meeting responded ( to the pressure ) in silencing him , " Jordan:__entity__ said after the opening of an ICFTU:__entity__ conference on international labour standards and trade .
The three-day trade union conference in Singapore:__entity__ hopes to push labour issues onto the WTO:__entity__ agenda .
Jordan:__entity__ said the WTO:__entity__ 's credibility was at stake over the issue of trade and labour .
The ICFTU:__entity__ said it wanted the WTO:__entity__ conference beginning on Monday to outlaw forced and child labour , end discrimination in hiring , and guarantee the right to join a union .
Bill:__entity__ Brett:__entity__ , chairman of the ILO:__entity__ Workers:__entity__ Group:__entity__ , told Reuters:__entity__ before the news conference he was " not too surprised , but very disappointed " that the speaking invitation had been withdrawn .
" Some governments are very determined to stop the issue ( of trade and labour rights ) being discussed , " he said , adding that the Association:__entity__ of:__entity__ Southeast:__entity__ Asian:__entity__ Nations:__entity__ ( ASEAN:__entity__ ) seemed particularly hostile to the ILO:__entity__ agenda .
ASEAN:__entity__ groups Brunei:__entity__ , Indonesia:__entity__ , Malaysia:__entity__ , the Philippines:__entity__ , Singapore:__entity__ , Thailand:__entity__ and Vietnam:__entity__ .
The ILO:__entity__ wants a trade and labour rights " social clause " included in the final ministerial statement issued by WTO:__entity__ leaders at the end of the meeting , the organization 's first ministerial-level gathering .
Speaking to ICFTU:__entity__ delegates , Richard:__entity__ Eglin:__entity__ , director of the WTO:__entity__ secretariat , said the WTO:__entity__ was capable of making a significant contribution to governmental efforts to solve social problems .
But he said the WTO:__entity__ 's organisational structure made it difficult to impose on its members a social clause such as that called for by the ILO:__entity__ .

Indian:__entity__ rubber demand seen outstripping production .
SINGAPORE:__entity__ 1996-12-06
Indian:__entity__ rubber demand is seen outpacing local production in the 1996/97 April / March season and the trend will persist way into the next century , the chairman of the Rubber:__entity__ Board:__entity__ of:__entity__ India:__entity__ said on Friday .
K.J.:__entity__ Matthew:__entity__ said at the Asia:__entity__ Rubber:__entity__ Markets:__entity__ meeting here Indian:__entity__ production of natural rubber in 1996/97 will reach 547,000 tonnes against projected demand of 578,000 tonnes , a gap of 31,000 tonnes .
For synthetic rubber , production reached 68,200 tonnes in 1995/96 while consumption in the same season hit 134,085 tonnes , Matthew:__entity__ added .
" Though schemes designed to realise further increases in the production of natural rubber are being operated successfully , the demand-supply gap is expected to widen , " he said .
Indian:__entity__ synthetic rubber output is not expected to rise significantly in the next season but demand will rise to 145,000 tonnes .
Matthew:__entity__ estimates that by the 2000/01 season , the gap between natural rubber output and consumption will rise to 51,000 tonnes and 319,000 tonnes in 2010/11 .
Natural rubber production will go up to 695,000 tonnes in 2000/01 against consumption of 746,000 tonnes .
In 2010/11 , domestic demand should rise further to 1.233 million tonnes while production will only reach about 914,000 tonnes .
One way to bridge the widening gap is to put more land under cultivation which the Rubber:__entity__ Board:__entity__ official estimates will reach 220,000 hectares between now and the year 2003 although Matthew:__entity__ said this may not be possible at this time in India:__entity__ .
" The development objective for the rubber plantation industry will be to increase production to the best extent possibly with a view to minimising imports of natural rubber , " he said .

Japan:__entity__ 's authorities seen seeking to rein in dollar .
George:__entity__ Nishiyama:__entity__
TOKYO:__entity__ 1996-12-06
Comments by Japan:__entity__ 's tight-lipped central bank chief and an influential top bureaucrat are further signs that the nation 's authorities want to keep the dollar at current levels , market sources said on Friday .
In a rare expression of a view on currencies by the Bank:__entity__ of:__entity__ Japan:__entity__ ( BOJ:__entity__ ) governor , Yasuo:__entity__ Matsushita:__entity__ was quoted in Japan:__entity__ 's leading economic daily on Friday as saying that he sees no further , immediate fall in the yen .
This followed a widely watched television appearance late on Thursday by Eisuke:__entity__ Sakakibara:__entity__ , a high-ranking Finance:__entity__ Ministry:__entity__ official , who denied he had said he wants to guide the dollar lower to between 108 and 110 yen .
But many in the market thought Sakakibara:__entity__ 's real intentions lay elsewhere , and took more notice of his comments about the U.S.:__entity__ government 's stance on the dollar , dealers said .
" I think his views on ( U.S.:__entity__ Treasury:__entity__ Secretary Robert:__entity__ ) Rubin:__entity__ 's comments were indeed what he himself thinks about the dollar , " said Hank:__entity__ Note:__entity__ , chief dealer at Sumitomo:__entity__ Bank:__entity__ .
Asked about Rubin:__entity__ 's comment that a strong dollar was in U.S.:__entity__ interests , Sakakibara:__entity__ said the remark does not necessarily mean the United:__entity__ States:__entity__ supports a stronger dollar .
" It 's a strong dollar , not stronger .
In that sense , the comments are not pointing to a certain direction , " he said .
" It shows that Sakakibara:__entity__ is not for a stronger dollar either , " said Sumitomo:__entity__ 's Note .
Takao:__entity__ Sakoh:__entity__ , first vice president at Union:__entity__ Bank:__entity__ of:__entity__ Switzerland:__entity__ in Tokyo:__entity__ , said : " Maybe a dollar at 104.50 yen is not acceptable ( to Sakakibara:__entity__ ) , but it may be okay at the current level , at the lower end of 112 yen . "
Market participants have kept a close eye on Sakakibara:__entity__ , chief of the ministry 's International:__entity__ Finance:__entity__ Bureau:__entity__ , as a comment he made in November after the dollar hit this year 's high of 114.92 yen pushed the currency down sharply .
He had said then that the market 's view on Japan:__entity__ 's economy was too pessimistic and that he believed it was stronger than the market thought .
Dealers have come to refer to 115 yen as the " Sakakibara:__entity__ ceiling " for the dollar following the remark .
Adding to the comments by " Mr:__entity__ Yen:__entity__ " , as Sakakibara:__entity__ is known for his prominence in the currency market , was BOJ:__entity__ governor Matsushita:__entity__ 's remark .
" The recent level of the yen exchange rate has been stable , and it does not appear to be moving towards a further depreciation of the yen immediately , so import prices are likely to stabilise at current levels , " Matsushita:__entity__ said in an interview with the Nihon:__entity__ Keizai:__entity__ Shimbun:__entity__ .
" The fact that he touched on the issue of inflation triggered by import prices shows that the BOJ:__entity__ does not want a further depreciation of the yen , past 115 yen , " said Yasuhito:__entity__ Kawashima:__entity__ , chief forex manager at Toyo:__entity__ Trust:__entity__ &:__entity__ Banking:__entity__ Co:__entity__ .:__entity__
Some said the central bank may have been concerned a weaker yen would lead to unfounded pessimism about Japan:__entity__ 's economy .
" There was concern that foreign investors may sell Japanese:__entity__ stocks if the dollar goes above 115 yen .
The BOJ:__entity__ does not want the yen 's weakness to lead to pessimism over the economy , " said Taisuke:__entity__ Tanaka:__entity__ , market strategist with Credit:__entity__ Suisse:__entity__ in Tokyo:__entity__ .
Senior BOJ:__entity__ officials have separately said financial markets ' views on the economy have been too negative .
" I realise there are negative views in the markets about the impact of the consumption tax hike and drop in public spending , but the markets appear to be exaggerating the magnitude of the negative impact , " a senior BOJ:__entity__ official told Reuters:__entity__ on Friday .
The consumption tax is due to raised in April from three to five percent .

Lebanon:__entity__ sentences pro-Israeli:__entity__ warlord to death .
Haitham:__entity__ Haddadin:__entity__
BEIRUT:__entity__ 1996-12-06
A Lebanese:__entity__ military court on Friday sentenced to death in absentia the commander of Israel:__entity__ 's surrogate militia in south Lebanon:__entity__ on treason charges .
The court convicted General Antoine:__entity__ Lahd:__entity__ , head of the South:__entity__ Lebanon:__entity__ Army:__entity__ ( SLA:__entity__ ) , of collaborating with Israel:__entity__ with which Lebanon:__entity__ is officially at war .
Lahd:__entity__ , a 69-year-old former Lebanese:__entity__ army major-general , heads the 3,000-strong SLA:__entity__ militia which helps Israel:__entity__ hold a border zone in south Lebanon:__entity__ to ward off cross-frontier guerrilla raids on northern Israel:__entity__ .
Lahd:__entity__ said a few days after the trial began on February 16 that Lebanese:__entity__ authorities must drop the charges or risk blocking any peace deal with the Jewish:__entity__ state .
He said Israel:__entity__ was capable of pressuring Lebanon:__entity__ 's Syrian-backed:__entity__ government to stop the legal pursuit .
The charges against Lahd:__entity__ were : forming a hostile army , carrying weapons on Israel:__entity__ 's side , helping Israel:__entity__ strip off a part of Lebanese:__entity__ territory by violence , forming an armed gang , killing or trying to kill Lebanese:__entity__ civilians by artillery shelling and kidnapping Lebanese:__entity__ citizens for long periods .
Shortly before Lahd:__entity__ 's trial began , a Beirut:__entity__ military prosecutor charged another 89 former Lebanese:__entity__ army soldiers with collaborating with Israel:__entity__ .
No date has been set for the trial of the men , all members of the SLA:__entity__ living in the Israeli-held:__entity__ zone in south Lebanon:__entity__ .
Israel:__entity__ and Lahd:__entity__ have repeatedly demanded safety guarantees for the SLA:__entity__ -- a mixed Christian-Shi'ite:__entity__ Moslem:__entity__ force -- which the Jewish:__entity__ states regards as loyal allies .
Israel:__entity__ has said the Lebanese:__entity__ army must incorporate the SLA:__entity__ fighters into its ranks as an army brigade as a condition for peace .
But Lebanese:__entity__ political analysts have said that would be out of the question and Lebanese:__entity__ authorities pre-empted the issue by taking legal action against Lahd:__entity__ .
Former Israeli:__entity__ Prime Minister Shimon:__entity__ Peres:__entity__ , calling Lahd:__entity__ " a great Lebanese:__entity__ patriot " , said earlier this year Lebanon:__entity__ had insulted the SLA:__entity__ commander by ordering his arrest on the treason charges .
Peres:__entity__ , who was ousted in May by rightwing Israeli:__entity__ leader Benjamin:__entity__ Netanyahu:__entity__ , said there could not be real negotiations with Lebanon:__entity__ " unless it will stop the maltreatment of the SLA:__entity__ and its commanders . "
The Beirut:__entity__ military court also sentenced to life in jail in absentia Etian:__entity__ Saqr:__entity__ , former head of the pro-Israeli:__entity__ Guardians:__entity__ of:__entity__ the:__entity__ Cedars:__entity__ , a small rightwing Christian:__entity__ civil war militia .
Saqr:__entity__ , whose trial was concurrent with Lahd:__entity__ 's , was convicted of " contacting the Israeli:__entity__ enemy , passing information to Israel:__entity__ and undertaking hostile acts against Lebanon:__entity__ " .

14 years later , Florida:__entity__ man dies for killing .
TALLAHASSEE:__entity__ , Fla.:__entity__ 1996-12-06
Fourteen years after he bludgeoned and shot a man whose trailer home he robbed in 1982 , John:__entity__ Mills:__entity__ Jr:__entity__ .
, 41 , was put to death in Florida:__entity__ 's electric chair Friday .
As Glenn:__entity__ Lawhon:__entity__ , a rural Florida:__entity__ minister who is the victim 's father , looked on , Mills:__entity__ was pronounced dead at 7:13 a.m. EST ( 1213 GMT:__entity__ ) for the murder of Lester:__entity__ Lawhon:__entity__ .
Speaking in Arabic:__entity__ , Mills:__entity__ made a final statement before an anonymous citizen flipped the switch that sent 2000 volts of electricity through his body , said Department:__entity__ of:__entity__ Corrections:__entity__ spokesman Eugene:__entity__ Morris:__entity__ , who was present at the execution .
" I bear witness that there is no God:__entity__ but Allah:__entity__ and I bear witness that the prophet Mohammed:__entity__ is the messenger of God:__entity__ , " he quoted Mills:__entity__ as saying .
Prison officials said they had no record of Mills:__entity__ ' official conversion , but they said that , on May 14 , 1991 , he had asked that a new name , Yuhanna:__entity__ Abdullah:__entity__ Muhammed:__entity__ , be added to his prison file , which is usually an indication of a conversion to Islam:__entity__ .
Mills:__entity__ is the 38th person to die in Florida:__entity__ 's electric chair since the U.S.:__entity__ Supreme:__entity__ Court:__entity__ reversed itself in 1976 and legalised the death penalty .
Prison officials said Mills:__entity__ made no special request for a last meal and did not eat the steak , fried potatoes and orange juice offered him .
He spent Thursday with family members and his spiritual adviser , Morris:__entity__ said .
Mills:__entity__ was scheduled to die Wednesday but had his sentence temporarily postponed by the Florida:__entity__ Supreme:__entity__ Court:__entity__ .
On Thursday , the 11th Circuit:__entity__ U.S.:__entity__ Court:__entity__ of:__entity__ Appeals:__entity__ in Atlanta:__entity__ denied his appeal in federal court .
In March 1982 , Mills:__entity__ and accomplice Michael:__entity__ Frederick:__entity__ knocked on the door of Lester:__entity__ Lawhon:__entity__ 's trailer in an attempt to rob it , police said .
Lester:__entity__ Lawhon:__entity__ was taken to a nearby airstrip where he was bludgeoned with a tire iron .
Mills:__entity__ then fired two shots that killed Lawhon:__entity__ as the victim tried to run away .

A farmhand used the proceeds from stolen pigs to lavish tips on dancers at strip clubs and offered one $ 3,000 to pay for breast implant surgery , authorities said Friday .
In sentencing Darrel:__entity__ Voeks:__entity__ , 38 , to a 10-year prison term on Thursday , Outagmie:__entity__ County:__entity__ Circuit Court Judge Dennis:__entity__ Luebke:__entity__ said he was " a thief by habit . "
" You are self-indulgent .
You are narcissitic , " Luebke:__entity__ said at the sentencing , adding Voeks:__entity__ should pay restitution of more than $ 100,000 to the farming family who had hired him .
Voeks:__entity__ , who was already on probation for prior pig thefts , pleaded that he was trying to pay bills for his ex-wife and children .
But the court heard that receipts showed much of the money went to dancers at strip clubs where he was known as a big tipper .
One stripper said Voeks:__entity__ offered to give her $ 3,000 for breast implant surgery .

Half of dog bites provoked , says American:__entity__ vet .
CHICAGO:__entity__ 1996-12-06
As many as 1 million dog bites are recorded in the United:__entity__ States:__entity__ every year and half of them are provoked by humans , a veterinarian told fellow animal doctors on Friday .
The Humane:__entity__ Society:__entity__ of:__entity__ the:__entity__ United:__entity__ States:__entity__ estimates that between 500,000 and one million bites are delivered by dogs each year , more than half of which are suffered by children .
" Most bites can be prevented by teaching children how to respect a dog , " Michael:__entity__ Cornwell:__entity__ of the Glencoe:__entity__ Animal:__entity__ Hospital:__entity__ in Columbus:__entity__ , Ohio:__entity__ , told the annual meeting of the American:__entity__ Veterinary:__entity__ Medical:__entity__ Association:__entity__ .
" Let 's not let our kids jump on them or crawl on them .
Dogs and children do n't have to have an interaction .
Let 's respect their territories , " he said .
Cornwell:__entity__ said 50 percent of reported bites were provoked by a person and 60 percent were suffered by children .
He also estimated that only 25 percent of bites were reported because medical attention was not needed .
Don:__entity__ Rieck:__entity__ , president of the National:__entity__ Animal:__entity__ Control:__entity__ Association:__entity__ , said aggressiveness in dogs was related more to gender than breed and a male dog that had not been neutered was three times more likely to bite than an unspayed female .
The five breeds credited with the most incidents were chow:__entity__ chows:__entity__ , Rottweilers:__entity__ , German:__entity__ shepherds:__entity__ , cocker:__entity__ spaniels:__entity__ and Dalmatians:__entity__ . "
The trends in dog bites by particular breeds have more to do with fad pets owned by individuals who need to have something unique .
Speaking strictly of dogs , 15 years ago the macho fad pet was a Doberman:__entity__ .
Today , Rottweilers:__entity__ are on the way up , " Rieck:__entity__ said .
If approached by a stray dog , children should be taught to stand still with fists folded underneath the neck , elbows in , and gaze forward until the dog goes away .

Four Africans:__entity__ said to vie for top U.N.:__entity__ post .

UNITED:__entity__ NATIONS:__entity__ 1996-12-06
Four African:__entity__ states are ready to nominate candidates for the post of U.N.:__entity__ secretary-general on Friday now that Boutros:__entity__ Boutros-Ghali:__entity__ has temporarily put aside his bid for re-election .
The nominees , according to diplomats , are : Kofi:__entity__ Annan:__entity__ of Ghana:__entity__ , the U.N.:__entity__ undersecretary-general for peacekeeping ; Ahmedou:__entity__ Ould:__entity__ Abdallah:__entity__ of Mauritania:__entity__ , the former U.N.:__entity__ special envoy for Burundi:__entity__ ; Amara:__entity__ Essy:__entity__ of the Ivory:__entity__ Coast:__entity__ , its foreign minister and the U.N.:__entity__ General:__entity__ Assembly:__entity__ president in 1994-95 ; and Hamid:__entity__ Algabid:__entity__ of Niger:__entity__ , the secretary-general of the Organisation:__entity__ of:__entity__ the:__entity__ Islamic:__entity__ Conference:__entity__ .
Representatives of the U.N.:__entity__ missions of Ghana:__entity__ , the Ivory:__entity__ Coast:__entity__ , Mauritania:__entity__ and Niger:__entity__ have scheduled a meeting with Security:__entity__ Council:__entity__ president Paolo:__entity__ Fulci:__entity__ of Italy:__entity__ to hand in the nominations in writing , the envoys said .
It was not known if other candidates would step forward .
Diplomats said General Joseph:__entity__ Garba:__entity__ of Nigeria:__entity__ , a U.N.:__entity__ General:__entity__ Assembly:__entity__ president in 1989-90 , was putting forth his own candidacy without being nominated by his country .
Boutros-Ghali:__entity__ on Wednesday opened the door for other Africans:__entity__ to contest his job by saying he was suspending temporarily his candidacy but was not withdrawing completely from the race .
His supporters said this meant he remained a candidate in case the race reached an impasse .
The United:__entity__ States:__entity__ on Nov. 19 vetoed his bid for re-election while the other 14 Security:__entity__ Council:__entity__ members supported him .
The move by the African:__entity__ states means that the council could begin voting on candidates next week , a procedure that could either result in a decision or turn into a bitter fight with vetoes against each nominee .
The Security:__entity__ Council:__entity__ has to vote on a new secretary-general and then seek the endorsement of the 185-members General:__entity__ Assembly:__entity__ before December 31 when Boutros-Ghali:__entity__ 's term expires .

Hindu:__entity__ nationalists forced adjournment of India:__entity__ 's lower house of parliament on Friday , in protest against a proposal to observe a minute 's silence over the destruction of a mosque by a Hindu:__entity__ mob in 1992 .
Members of the Hindu:__entity__ nationalist Bharatiya:__entity__ Janata:__entity__ Party:__entity__ ( BJP:__entity__ ) shouted pro-Hindu:__entity__ slogans in the house after a communist deputy made the proposal in remembrance of the Babri:__entity__ mosque , which was razed on December 6 , 1992 .
The house was first adjourned for two hours .
When it reconvened , BJP:__entity__ deputies resumed the slogan-shouting , and deputy speaker Suraj:__entity__ Bhan:__entity__ suspended work until Monday .
The destruction of the 16th-century mosque in the northern Indian:__entity__ town of Ayodhya:__entity__ triggered nationwide Hindu-Moslem:__entity__ violence in which more than 3,000 people were killed .

Two people were killed when an executive jet en route to Ireland:__entity__ from Michigan:__entity__ crashed on approach to an airport in Stephenville:__entity__ , Newfoundland:__entity__ , on Friday , authorities said .
The pilot and co-pilot , the only two aboard , were killed in the crash of the Learjet:__entity__ 36:__entity__ , airport manager David:__entity__ Snow:__entity__ said in a telephone interview .
Snow:__entity__ said the plane last reported to air traffic control at about 3 A.M. local time / 1:30 A.M. EST ( 0630 GMT:__entity__ ) when it began its final approach about 10 miles ( 16 km ) from the airport in this east coast Canadian:__entity__ province .
That was the last communication the aircraft made with the airport , he added .
" We considered it as being missing until about 0600 ( 4:30 A.M. EST ) ( 0930 GMT:__entity__ ) .
That 's when the wreckage was discovered , " Snow:__entity__ said .
He said the cargo flight originated in Grand:__entity__ Rapids:__entity__ , Michigan:__entity__ , and was due to stop at Stephenville:__entity__ for refueling before going to Shannon:__entity__ , Ireland:__entity__ .

PLO:__entity__ says Arafat:__entity__ , Netanyahu:__entity__ could meet Saturday .
JERUSALEM:__entity__ 1996-12-06
PLO:__entity__ negotiators said on Friday Palestinian:__entity__ President Yasser:__entity__ Arafat:__entity__ , Israeli:__entity__ Prime Minister Benjamin:__entity__ Netanyahu:__entity__ and Egyptian:__entity__ President Hosni:__entity__ Mubarak:__entity__ might all meet on Saturday to try to clinch a deal on Israel:__entity__ 's handover of Hebron:__entity__ to the PLO:__entity__ .
" It is very possible that Arafat:__entity__ and Netanyahu:__entity__ will meet in Cairo:__entity__ on Saturday .
There is work on arranging such a meeting hosted by President Mubarak:__entity__ , " one PLO:__entity__ official , who requested anonymity , told Reuters:__entity__ .
Israeli:__entity__ officials said no meeting had yet been set .
Arafat:__entity__ 's adviser Nabil:__entity__ Abu:__entity__ Rdainah:__entity__ said :
" President Arafat:__entity__ is ready to meet Prime Minister Netanyahu:__entity__ but no time or date has been set for such a meeting yet .
" President Arafat:__entity__ 's position is clear that such a meeting should come after successful negotiations so that the meeting would have positive results .
Especially since the Hebron:__entity__ issue has not been agreed yet and the crucial disputed issues have not been resolved . "
But Rdainah:__entity__ said Arafat:__entity__ would go to Cairo:__entity__ on Saturday for talks with Mubarak:__entity__ .
Both Arafat:__entity__ and Netanyahu:__entity__ have expressed willingness to meet .
They last met in Washington:__entity__ after clashes in September that killed 60 Palestinians:__entity__ and 15 Israelis:__entity__ .
The violence was spurred by Israel:__entity__ 's opening an entrance to a tunnel near Moslem:__entity__ sites in Jerusalem:__entity__ .
The Palestine:__entity__ Liberation:__entity__ Organisation:__entity__ ( PLO:__entity__ ) negotiators said the last two weeks of talks with Israel:__entity__ on implementing the long-delayed handover of most of Hebron:__entity__ to PLO:__entity__ rule had been " meaningless " , necessitating an Arafat-Netanyahu:__entity__ meeting .
Mubarak:__entity__ 's adviser Osama:__entity__ el-Baz:__entity__ said on Thursday there were efforts to arrange a meeting between the Israeli:__entity__ and Palestinian:__entity__ leaders .
Palestinian:__entity__ Authority:__entity__ Secretary General Ahmed:__entity__ Abdel-Rahman:__entity__ said on Thursday he understood it could be held in Cairo:__entity__ either on Friday or Sunday .
Abdel-Rahman:__entity__ had said on Thursday he did not think Saturday would be the date because it is the Jewish:__entity__ sabbath .
But the Jewish:__entity__ sabbath ends at sundown , so a night meeting would not interfere with the religious observance .

Turkey:__entity__ hindered by own landmines on Syrian:__entity__ border .
ANKARA:__entity__ 1996-12-06
Turkey:__entity__ 's efforts to prevent Kurdish:__entity__ rebels and smugglers infiltrating from Syria:__entity__ are being badly hindered because the military does not have a map of its own minefields on the border , a commission of parliamentarians said .
" It is not known exactly where the mines have been sown because a minefield chart cannot be found , " the commission said in a report on border protection .
The report , to be debated in parliament in coming weeks , was seen by Reuters:__entity__ on Friday . "
Officials say the minefields present an obstacle to the security forces , " it said .
It said Kurdistan:__entity__ Workers:__entity__ Party:__entity__ ( PKK:__entity__ ) guerrillas sometimes know the layout of mined areas along the border better than the security forces .
" Terrorists and smugglers have dug up the mines , defused them and opened up wide paths in some areas .
They can come in and out easily as the minefields are not an obstacle , " it said .
An armed forces spokesman was not available for comment .
Turkey:__entity__ says Syria:__entity__ sponsors the PKK:__entity__ , fighting for Kurdish:__entity__ self-rule in southeast Turkey:__entity__ .
Damascus:__entity__ denies aiding the rebels .

Three people were killed on Friday in a gun battle between rival groups of anti-guerrilla militiamen on the streets of this southeastern Turkish:__entity__ city , police said .
Four others were wounded in the clash , caused by a blood feud between two families , the Kesers:__entity__ and Karabuluts:__entity__ , serving as state-paid village guards against Kurdish:__entity__ rebels .
Police said the guards fired automatic weapons at each other .
One of the dead was a civilian passer-by .
The role of the 70,000 mainly Kurdish:__entity__ village guards who fight Kurdistan:__entity__ Workers:__entity__ Party:__entity__ ( PKK:__entity__ ) guerrillas in the southeast has been questioned recently after media allegations that many of them are involved in common crime .

U.S.:__entity__ blasts release of convicted bomber .
WASHINGTON:__entity__ 1996-12-05
The United:__entity__ States:__entity__ Thursday blasted the release from a Greek:__entity__ prison of a Palestinian:__entity__ guerrilla convicted of bombing an airliner and killing a teenager in 1982 , saying the move " does not make sense . "
" All of us who have been victimised by terrorists ... need to stand together against terrorists .
We ca n't let terrorists out of jail when they are a danger to civilians all around the world , " State:__entity__ Department:__entity__ spokesman Nicholas:__entity__ Burns:__entity__ said . '
Mohammed:__entity__ Rashid:__entity__ " is a terrorist who deserves to be behind bars .
It is inexplicable to us why he would have been allowed to leave Greece:__entity__ before serving his just sentence ... This is an incomprehensible move .
It does not make sense , " Burns:__entity__ told a news briefing .
He spoke after Rashid:__entity__ left Greece:__entity__ Thursday on being freed from prison early for good behaviour after serving 8-1/2 years .
The Clinton:__entity__ administration 's strong views on this subject have been conveyed to the Greek:__entity__ government , Burns:__entity__ said .
Mahammad:__entity__ Rashid:__entity__ was whisked from Korydallos:__entity__ maximum security prison just outside Athens:__entity__ to the airport where he boarded a regular Olympic:__entity__ Airways:__entity__ flight to Cairo:__entity__ where he would transit to Tunis:__entity__ and the former Palestine:__entity__ Liberation:__entity__ Organisation:__entity__ headquarters .
Rashid:__entity__ , 46 , was sentenced to 18 years in prison by a Greek:__entity__ court in 1992 after being convicted of premeditated murder in the mid-air bombing of a Pan:__entity__ American:__entity__ airliner in 1982 .
His sentence had been reduced to 15 years in 1993 .
A parole court ruled recently that Rashid:__entity__ could be freed after serving 8-1/2 years , with time in pre-trial detention counted towards his term , but said he must be expelled immediately from Greece:__entity__ .
The United:__entity__ States:__entity__ accuses Rashid:__entity__ of belonging to the May 15 Palestinian:__entity__ guerrilla group and being an accomplished student of master Palestinian:__entity__ bombmaker Abu:__entity__ Ibrahim:__entity__ .
Three FBI:__entity__ agents who testified against Rashid:__entity__ during the trial , held at Korydallos:__entity__ prison , said they had ample evidence against Rashid:__entity__ for a bomb planted on a Pan:__entity__ American:__entity__ plane in Brazil:__entity__ in 1982 and a mid-air bomb blast on a TWA:__entity__ airliner approaching Athens:__entity__ in 1986 which killed four U.S.:__entity__ citizens .

Cyberspace squabbles overshadow copyright talks .
Elif:__entity__ Kaban:__entity__
GENEVA:__entity__ 1996-12-06
In a gloomy Geneva:__entity__ conference centre built before the dawn of the Internet:__entity__ , groups of staid officials made a first stab on Friday at rewriting copyright laws for the digital age .
But critics at the first government-level meeting to revise copyright laws in 25 years said the officials and legislators might as well be trying to police the ether .
After four days of diplomatic wrangling over procedures , some 600 delegates from nations small and large got down to the nitty-gritty of setting the digital agenda for the first time .
Cyberspace squabbles overshadowed the debate on a stack of proposals covering literary and artistic works , the rights of performers and producers of music and producers of databases .
" If it goes on like this , we wo n't have enough time to finish all the discussions , " a frustrated Western delegate said . "
They announced they will start evening sessions next week . "
Attempts by copyright-based industries to ensure they get a cut from online works led to a storm of protests by Internet:__entity__ companies and critics who say the pacts would curb public access to online information from soccer results to stock prices .
" It 's not illegal to make photocopies of newspaper articles .
It 's fair use .
We can read sports statistics or stock prices .
But with the treaty , this kind of fact will be owned and subject to licensing , " said James:__entity__ Love:__entity__ , a consumer lobbyist heading the Washington-based:__entity__ Consumer:__entity__ Project:__entity__ on:__entity__ Technology:__entity__ .
" None of the treaties are ready to move .
These people do n't understand what they 're doing . "
At stake are billions of dollars and the future of the electronic information industry -- the coming medium for the distribution of music , films , literature , software and commerce .
Supporters of the three pacts say they are only an extension of existing intellectual property rights , covered by the century-old Berne:__entity__ Convention:__entity__ .
But an array of opponents from the network industry to consumer , scientific and academic groups say the pacts will give sweeping powers to entertainment and copyright-based industries .
A quick survey at the conference centre found few officials who had actually surfed the Internet:__entity__ .
Mongolia:__entity__ 's state copyright official , Gundegma:__entity__ Jargalshaihan:__entity__ , said apologetically that he had just arrived from Ulan:__entity__ Bator:__entity__ and was not aware of the details of the digital agenda .
" We do n't have money for Internet:__entity__ in Mongolia:__entity__ , " he added .
Alexander:__entity__ Bavykin:__entity__ , deputy legal chief at Russia:__entity__ 's foreign ministry , said Moscow:__entity__ had yet to formulate a policy on copyright in cybersppace .
He too had never browsed the Net:__entity__ .
" I 've never tried it and why should I ?
There are lots of other things in this life I have n't tried either , " he said .
A visit to the computer centre offering Internet:__entity__ services found a lone European:__entity__ official clicking away on his mouse .
" Internet:__entity__ is a potential cash cow for copyright-based industries and we need roadmaps on the information superhighway , " said Marc:__entity__ Pearl:__entity__ , vice-president of the Information:__entity__ Technology:__entity__ Association:__entity__ of:__entity__ America:__entity__ , a trade association of U.S.:__entity__ network companies opposing the treaties .
" But there are a lot of dinosaurs here .
People here do n't understand Internet:__entity__ technology .
Because they do n't understand technology , they fear the unknown . "
Before the Internet:__entity__ , those whose business was to protect copyrights knew where they stood .
Their enemies were tangible if elusive , such as the people who pirated music cassettes .
But the Internet:__entity__ , a global computer network where anything from music to software can be duplicated and distributed at the click of a computer mouse , has ripped up the rulebooks .
Network operators said the draft laws would hold them responsible for copyright infringements in the system and expose them to multi-billion-dollar liabilities .
" There are 500 million messages transmitted through the Internet:__entity__ everyday , " said Tim:__entity__ Casey:__entity__ of the U.S.-based:__entity__ MCI:__entity__ Communications:__entity__ Corporation:__entity__ . "
How can we control them all ? "

" Help Italy:__entity__ to teach , to propose a capacity for strong local autonomy , for the federalism which can give new vigour to our blood .
But turn back from the line you are taking now , " he said .
Scalfaro:__entity__ was in Mantua:__entity__ to attend a ceremony commemorating the executions there by Austrian:__entity__ rulers in 1852 and 1853 of a group of Italians:__entity__ who had campaigned for national unity .
He was jeered and whistled at by a small group of League:__entity__ supporters when he arrived for a visit marked by heavy security .
Witnesses said the protesters were outnumbered by other Italians:__entity__ who waved tricolour flags in the national red , white and green or shouted " Viva Italia:__entity__ " .
The League:__entity__ won more than eight percent of votes at the last general election in April on a federalist platform but its leader Umberto:__entity__ Bossi:__entity__ later switched to a separatist agenda .
A three-day " independence " march along the Po:__entity__ River:__entity__ in September , culminating in a declaration in Venice:__entity__ of a self-styled " Republic:__entity__ of:__entity__ Padania:__entity__ " , flopped badly .

British:__entity__ " Euro-sceptic:__entity__ " says Clarke:__entity__ should resign .
LONDON:__entity__ 1996-12-06
A " Euro-sceptic:__entity__ " member of the ruling Conservative:__entity__ party said on Thursday British:__entity__ finance minister Kenneth:__entity__ Clarke:__entity__ had to resign to prevent the party disintegrating over the issue of a single European:__entity__ currency .
Member of Parliament Tony:__entity__ Marlow:__entity__ said the resignation of the chancellor of the exchequer was the only way to make the Conservatives electable in a general election which must take place by May next year .
" We have a divided and split Cabinet:__entity__ .
This cannot endure , " Marlow:__entity__ told BBC:__entity__ television 's Newsnight:__entity__ programme on Thursday . "
It is not sustainable .
Kenneth:__entity__ Clarke:__entity__ has to go .
If he does n't resign , the prime minister has got to fire him . "
Marlow:__entity__ 's comment come on the heels of speculation that Clarke:__entity__ had threatened to resign if the government changed its " wait and see " policy on a single currency and declared it would not sign up for the currency in the next Parliament .
Clarke:__entity__ denied on Thursday he had threatened to resign and said his position on the single currency was in tune with that of Prime Minister John:__entity__ Major:__entity__ .
Major:__entity__ told parliament on Thursday he would keep his options open on single-currency membership .
His statement was interpreted as a significant victory for Clarke:__entity__ and fellow pro-European:__entity__ Michael:__entity__ Heseltine:__entity__ , deputy prime minister .
Pro-European:__entity__ Conservative:__entity__ MP Edwina:__entity__ Currie:__entity__ told the BBC:__entity__ that if Clarke:__entity__ resigned , other ministers would go with him .

Court ejects head of Australian:__entity__ child-sex inquiry .
CANBERRA:__entity__ 1996-12-06
The Australian:__entity__ opposition on Friday demanded a high-powered investigation into paedophilia in the Australian:__entity__ diplomatic service after the federal court forced the head of the existing inquiry to stand aside .
The court said inquiry head Chris:__entity__ Hunt:__entity__ might be biased , since he privately told a newspaper he had turned up no major evidence of paedophile activity , even though he still had months ' of investigation before him .
" Today we are left with a ruinous wreck beyond salvage and a continuing pall of doubt and suspicion hanging over our diplomatic service , " opposition foreign affairs spokesman Laurie:__entity__ Brereton:__entity__ said .
But the government responded by pressing ahead with the original inquiry , established in May , appointing a new head to lead it .
Critics say that if there were many paedophiles in senior posts in the Foreign:__entity__ Affairs:__entity__ Department:__entity__ then a secret inquiry would be open to internal influence and would become a public service whitewash .
Accordingly , they demand an open investigation .
A spokesman for Foreign:__entity__ Affairs:__entity__ Minister Alexander:__entity__ Downer:__entity__ said the appointment of a new inquiry head , administrative law expert Pamela:__entity__ O'Neil:__entity__ , showed the government 's commitment to pursue the matter .
A report is due in May next year .

An Australian:__entity__ hitman who went to the wrong house and killed the wrong man was sentenced to 20 years jail on Friday .
Paul:__entity__ Crofts:__entity__ , 33 , and an accomplice were contracted to shoot a man , identified only as Tony:__entity__ , in the leg to punish him for his misconduct with a female friend of the contractor , the New:__entity__ South:__entity__ Wales:__entity__ Supreme:__entity__ Court:__entity__ was told .

The inference from all the material is that the marauders had come to the wrong house , " Judge Michael:__entity__ Grove:__entity__ said .
In sentencing Crofts:__entity__ , who pleaded guilty , Grove:__entity__ took into account his " mildly retarded " intellectual state , which placed him in the lowest two percent of the population .
Grove:__entity__ said Betcher:__entity__ was " not only the victim of a horrendous crime , but his death was brought about in circumstances of an equally ghastly error on the part of the prisoner and his accomplices " .

Canada:__entity__ 's Bre-X:__entity__ Minerals:__entity__ Ltd:__entity__ and Barrick:__entity__ Gold:__entity__ Corp:__entity__ are to continue negotiations to hammer out a partnership agreement to develop the spectacular Busang:__entity__ gold find in Indonesia:__entity__ , sources close to the talks said on Friday .
" The negotiations will be held both in Toronto:__entity__ and in Jakarta:__entity__ , " one source , speaking on condition of anonymity , told Reuters:__entity__ .
Another source said most of the key negotiators from both Bre-X:__entity__ and Barrick:__entity__ had returned to Toronto:__entity__ , but declined to say if there had been any progress in their negotiations .
Both sources said Bre-X:__entity__ and Barrick:__entity__ did not hold talks on Thursday with Mines:__entity__ and:__entity__ Energy:__entity__ Ministry:__entity__ Secretary-General Umar:__entity__ Said:__entity__ , who is coordinating the negotiations over the Busang:__entity__ find in East:__entity__ Kalimantan:__entity__ .
The first source also said Bre-X:__entity__ had until December 21 to submit to the Indonesian:__entity__ Mines:__entity__ and:__entity__ Energy:__entity__ Ministry:__entity__ a feasibility study on the central region of the Busang:__entity__ property , estimated to contain 2.6 million ounces of gold .
The richest parts of the property to the north and south of the central region have been estimated by Bre-X:__entity__ to contain 57 million ounces of gold .
" Bre-X:__entity__ is expected to complete the feasibility report by December 16 and submit it to the government before the December 21 deadline , " the source said .
He said Bre-X:__entity__ would then formally seek the permission of the Indonesian:__entity__ government to begin construction to develop Busang:__entity__ 's central region , which might take up to two years .
The source declined to say if there had been any progress in the talks between Bre-X:__entity__ and Barrick:__entity__ .
" This is a huge project ...
we are not selling furniture , and Bre-X:__entity__ has 13,000 shareholders to answer to , " the source said .
" While there has been some agreement in principle on some issues , there are still others such as procedures and mechanisms that needed to be sorted out , " he added .
The source said no new deadline had been set by the Mines:__entity__ and:__entity__ Energy:__entity__ Ministry:__entity__ for Bre-X:__entity__ and Barrick:__entity__ to strike a deal .
The Ministry had given the companies until December 4 to complete a partnership deal , and advised Bre-X:__entity__ to take a 25 percent stake and Barrick:__entity__ 75 percent to develop the property .
" As far as I am aware , there 's been no new deadline , " the source said .
The Ministry 's Umar:__entity__ said on Thursday that both Bre-X:__entity__ and Barrick:__entity__ had responded positively to a government letter recommending a 25-75 split in the Busang:__entity__ gold property .
The government also wants 10 percent of the property .
Umar:__entity__ said the government had yet to receive a formal reply from the companies .
He had said earlier that if the two companies failed to reach a partnership agreement , the government would explore other ways to expedite development of the Busang:__entity__ find .
Bre-X:__entity__ has a partnership deal with PT:__entity__ Panutan:__entity__ Duta:__entity__ of the Panutan:__entity__ Group:__entity__ run by President Suharto:__entity__ 's eldest son , Sigit:__entity__ Harjojudanto:__entity__ , under which Panutan:__entity__ would receive $ 40 million over 40 months plus a 10 percent stake Busang:__entity__ 's richest parts .

FEATURE - Singapore:__entity__ sees prestige in hosting WTO:__entity__ .
Ramthan:__entity__ Hussain:__entity__
SINGAPORE:__entity__ 1996-12-06
Singapore:__entity__ 's winning campaign to host the World:__entity__ Trade:__entity__ Organisation:__entity__ ( WTO:__entity__ ) 's first ministerial meeting reflected its ambition to play a key role in shaping global free trade , the lifeblood of its economy , analysts said .
" As one of the world 's most externally oriented economies , Singapore:__entity__ has a disproportionately large stake in the WTO:__entity__ , " said Desmond:__entity__ Supple:__entity__ , economist at research house I.D.E.A:__entity__ .
" Singapore:__entity__ stands to benefit more than most from continued global trade liberalisation as trade is the engine of its growth , accounting for nearly three times its gross domestic product . "
The city-state met U.S.:__entity__ opposition two years ago in its bid to host the meeting , expected to gather 4,000 officials from 160 countries from December 9 to 13 .
In a stand some analysts linked to controversy over Singapore:__entity__ 's caning of an American:__entity__ teenager for vandalism , then-U.S.:__entity__ Trade Representative Mickey:__entity__ Kantor:__entity__ had said the meeting ought to be held where the WTO:__entity__ was going to be headquartered .
That would have meant Geneva:__entity__ .
But Singapore:__entity__ had the support of other WTO:__entity__ members .
Derek:__entity__ da:__entity__ Cunha:__entity__ , senior fellow at the Institute:__entity__ of:__entity__ Policy:__entity__ Studies:__entity__ ( ISEAS:__entity__ ) , said Singapore:__entity__ 's hosting of the conference " carries a great deal of symbolism for the city-state , underscoring its commitment to free trade and its trading links across the globe . "
There is the international prestige Singapore:__entity__ would enjoy , but " more importantly there is a genuine national interest in fostering better global free trade and an open market " , said Tan:__entity__ Kong:__entity__ Yam:__entity__ , head of Business Policy at the National:__entity__ University:__entity__ of:__entity__ Singapore:__entity__ .
At the ministerial meeting , trade ministers will review the work of the WTO:__entity__ and the implementation of the Uruguay:__entity__ Round:__entity__ free trade commitments under its predecessor the General:__entity__ Agreement:__entity__ on:__entity__ Tariffs:__entity__ and:__entity__ Trade:__entity__ ( GATT:__entity__ ) .
In June , the WTO:__entity__ hailed Singapore:__entity__ for its open market policies but the European:__entity__ Union:__entity__ and other trading powers called on Singapore:__entity__ to speed up the opening of its services sector .
Supple:__entity__ said the struggle that Singapore:__entity__ had to wage in vying to host the meeting would be repeated during the talks .
" There is tension at every step of the way , " since a battle line between the West:__entity__ and developing countries has been drawn over the issue of linking trade liberalisation with labour rights , he said .
Supple:__entity__ said hosting the meeting carried prestige for Singapore:__entity__ , " however , this is quite intangible as the prestige factor may not necessarily lead to any additional investment and trade flows to this region . "
From a commercial point of view , the meeting would be good for Singapore:__entity__ 's tourism industry , Tan:__entity__ said .
A large part of Singapore:__entity__ 's workforce would be mobilised to ensure the meeting would run without a glitch but the average Singaporean:__entity__ " would probably not be too concerned about some of the issues , " Tan:__entity__ said .
" But the more educated public will realise that these kind of things are important for Singapore:__entity__ as a small economy . "
Supple:__entity__ said any political gains the Singapore:__entity__ government would get from the WTO:__entity__ meeting -- ahead of a general election due by April 1997 -- would depend on how successful it was in pushing its economic agenda .
" If there are any movements toward freer trade , then Singapore:__entity__ 's economy and the electorate would gain , " he said . "
But I do n't think it would be wise to play up the political aspect of this .
I think political issues will take secondary importance to all these economic issues that will be displayed . "

" We hope to start international telephone business as soon as possible , " a company official told Reuters:__entity__ .
The official said the latest government decision to split the company under a holding company would allow flexibility in NTT:__entity__ 's international phone business .
Earlier , Posts and Telecommunications Minister Hisao:__entity__ Horinouchi:__entity__ told a news conference the government plans to split NTT:__entity__ into three firms under a holding company , but did not specify when the restructuring would likely take effect .
One of the three new companies will be a long-distance operator and the other two will be local-call operators , Horinouchi:__entity__ said .
One of the local firms will operate in west Japan:__entity__ and the other in east Japan:__entity__ , he added .
The long-distance operator will offer international services , Horinouchi:__entity__ said .
The NTT:__entity__ official said the timing of the planned split-up was uncertain because more discussions by government officials were required .

ALPINE SKIING-OFFICIALS HOPE TO SALVAGE WORLD:__entity__ CUP:__entity__ WEEKEND .
WHISTLER:__entity__ , British:__entity__ Columbia:__entity__ 1996-12-06
World:__entity__ Cup:__entity__ ski officials hope to be able to get in at least one men 's downhill training run on Saturday in an effort to salvage the weekend racing programme .
For the third consecutive day , Friday 's scheduled training runs were cancelled due to heavy wet snow and fog on Whistler:__entity__ Mountain:__entity__ , leaving the scheduled World:__entity__ Cup:__entity__ events in jeopardy .
Rules call for at least one training run to be completed before a World:__entity__ Cup:__entity__ downhill race can be staged .
Organisers hope to get that run in on Saturday morning , conditions permitting , and stage the race later in the day or on Sunday .
" There was no possibility today to make a training run , " said Bernd:__entity__ Zobel:__entity__ , the Canadian:__entity__ men 's national coach , citing too much new snow and poor visibility .
If organisers are forced to run the downhill on Sunday , the super-giant slalom originally scheduled for Sunday would likely be abandoned .

LONDON:__entity__ 1996-12-07
David:__entity__ Campese:__entity__ will consider offers to play club rugby in England:__entity__ but looks more likely to spend the next year chasing business opportunities in Australia:__entity__ .
The 34-year-old winger played his final game in a Wallaby:__entity__ jersey on Saturday but is currently a target for clubs eager to match London:__entity__ side Saracens:__entity__ who have already snapped up Francois:__entity__ Pienaar:__entity__ , Michael:__entity__ Lynagh:__entity__ and Philippe:__entity__ Sella:__entity__ .
" If the opportunity is there I 'd obviously think about it but the thing that holds me back is business , " said Campese:__entity__ .
" I 'd like to come over but there are a lot of things happening at home .
I 've also got a contract to play for New:__entity__ South:__entity__ Wales:__entity__ in the Super:__entity__ 12:__entity__ next year . "
Former Wallaby:__entity__ captain Nick:__entity__ Farr-Jones:__entity__ believes Campese:__entity__ may yet be tempted to England:__entity__ .

Kim:__entity__ Do:__entity__ Hoon:__entity__ opened the scoring for South:__entity__ Korea:__entity__ in only the fifth minute , turning unmarked on the penalty spot to fire a shot into the top corner .
It looked like turning into a rout as Hwang:__entity__ Sun:__entity__ Hong:__entity__ rapidly added two more in the seventh and 15th minutes but although the Koreans:__entity__ continued to dominate they failed to add to the score before the interval .
But they started the second half where they had left off and it was not long before they went four up , Ko:__entity__ Jeong:__entity__ Woon:__entity__ heading in from a free kick in the 55th minute .
The Koreans:__entity__ then appeared to relax , allowing the Indonesians:__entity__ to get back into the match .
Ronny:__entity__ Wabia:__entity__ scored for Indonesia:__entity__ three minutes later direct from a a corner kick that Korean:__entity__ goalkeeper Kim:__entity__ Byung:__entity__ reached with one hand but failed to keep out .
With 65 minutes gone Indonesia:__entity__ 's Widodo:__entity__ Putra:__entity__ , who scored a spectacular goal against Kuwait:__entity__ on Wednesday , was again on target , breaking through the Korean:__entity__ defence to beat the keeper with a low shot .

SOCCER - ENGLISHMAN:__entity__ CHARLTON:__entity__ IS MADE AN HONORARY IRISHMAN:__entity__ .
DUBLIN:__entity__ 1996-12-07
Jack:__entity__ Charlton:__entity__ 's relationship with the people of Ireland:__entity__ was cemented on Saturday when the Englishman:__entity__ was officially declared one of their own .
Charlton:__entity__ , 61 , and his wife , Peggy:__entity__ , became citizens of Ireland:__entity__ when they formally received Irish:__entity__ passports from deputy Prime Minister Dick:__entity__ Spring:__entity__ who said the honour had been made in recognition of Charlton:__entity__ 's achievements as the national soccer manager .
" The years I spent as manager of the Republic:__entity__ of:__entity__ Ireland:__entity__ were the best years of my life .
It all culminated in the fact that I now have lots of great , great friends in Ireland:__entity__ .
That is why this is so emotional a night for me , " Charlton:__entity__ said .
" It was the joy that we all had over the period , that I shared with people that I grew to love , that I treasure most , " he added .
Charlton:__entity__ managed Ireland:__entity__ for 93 matches , during which time they lost only 17 times in almost 10 years until he resigned in December 1995 .
He guided Ireland:__entity__ to two successive World:__entity__ Cup:__entity__ finals tournaments and to the 1988 European:__entity__ championship finals in Germany:__entity__ , after the Irish:__entity__ beat a well-fancied England:__entity__ team 1-0 in their group qualifier .
The lanky former Leeds:__entity__ United:__entity__ defender did not make his England:__entity__ debut until the age of 30 but eventually won 35 caps and was a key member of the 1966:__entity__ World:__entity__ Cup:__entity__ winning team with his younger brother , Bobby:__entity__ .
