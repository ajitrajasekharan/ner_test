IN SPITE OF MEDICAL HELP : THE PUZZLE OF AN
EIGHTEENTH - CENTURY PRIME MINISTER ' S
ILLNESS
by
MARJORIE BLOY *
Charles Watson Wentworth , second Marquis of Rockingham , died suddenly and unexpectedly on 1 July 1782 , when he was only 52 years old .
He had suffered - or enjoyed - ill health all his life but in 1782 appeared to be no worse than he had ever been .
His death in London terminated his second period of office as Prime Minister , to which he had been appointed only 14 weeks earlier .
In May he had reported to the Duke of Portland that he had " for some weeks past undergone much Pain and much inconvenience from something similar to my old Complaint in my Side and Stomach " but that he felt much better than he had . ' By 17 June he was recovering from both influenza and his " old complaint " . 2 On 1 July he died and on the 20th he was interred in York Minster .
The first recorded bout of illness suffered by the marquis , then Lord Higham , was in July 1741 when the 11 - year - old was " a little indisposed , something Feaverish I guess it proceeds from Worms and will Soon be removed " . 3 He also had a rash and it was thought that the cause of the problem was that the boy:__entity__ had overheated himself . 4 He was still ill at the beginning of August : he had been " much out of order " for a long time but had been recommended to take warm baths by Dr Wilmot and Mr Ranby when they were consulted in London . 5 Charles ' s aunt , Lady Isabella Finch , was sure that the baths " and other Things They ' ll prescribe will in a short Time entirely Cure his Complaints w [ hic ] h neither of Them thought proceed from any dangerous Causes " . 6 In spite of Lady Isabella ' s hopes , Charles did not greatly improve , even though his mother believed that he continued mending every day .
The main reason that Higham and his mother had gone to London to consult Dr Wilmot and Mr

An eighteenth - century Prime Minister ' s illness
Ranby was his mother ' s concern about a " swelling in a certain part which was larger than when we left Wentworth " .
The doctors hoped that it would burst outwards " which they assure me will be the safest way and give the poor Monkey but very little pain ' 7
On 20 August Lord Winchelsea , Higham ' s uncle , surprised to see the boy:__entity__ so well and brisk , hoped that Charles was " now safe from this complaint " - the same one from which he had suffered in 1738 - 39 - but thought that he would never be safe " if he continues the practice of overheating himself and then drinking Cold Water " .
He said that Charles was of a " pretty healthy strong Constitution " ; 8 Lady Malton was not so sure .
The same day she wrote a progress report to her husband saying that Charles ' s swelling continued to grow , as did the pain " in that part ( but not the lease [ sic ] trouble in making Water or going to Stool ) & less Fever than c [ oulJd be imagined where Matter is as they now imagine certainly gathering and must end in an operation " .
In spite of it all , Charles was in fine spirits . 9 Lady Malton dosed the boy:__entity__ with cinchona:__entity__ bark , which removed the pains in his legs and reduced his fever , and she was convinced that they would soon have " a clear Stage to act in a proper manner a [ bou ] t his other Complaints w [ hic ] h the Learned assure me are to be conquered also " .
10 Charles was soon allowed to eat meat and Mr Ranby still assured her that the swelling would break outwards .
1 " Three days later he decided to lance it , even though Dr Bourne disagreed .
The boy:__entity__ ' s mother was puzzled because the swelling " sometimes pushes forward very fast then retires a little " but the doctor and Ranby seemed happy with his condition . ' 2 At this point the letters cease , presumably because Malton arrived in London with his daughters , to have them inoculated against smallpox:__entity__ , but a later letter states that surgery to open the swelling was not undertaken .

By the end of October the correspondence had recommenced .
Charles was ill again .
He was just the same as when he left Kensington , so John Bourne had bled him and the child:__entity__ had started on Sir Edward Hulse ' s prescription , unfortunately not defined in the letter , but which was apparently as bad as the last one , if not worse .
Lady Malton thought that " with such a State of Blood the Continuation of Health cannot be expected " but was hopeful that the " Cinnabar may prove a more Efficacious remedie than any than has been tryed yet " " . " 4 That night she applied " a Blister . . . without the least Symptom or tendency to anything like Strangury " .
He bore the treatment well , as he had done three years previously , and it seemed so successful that Lady Malton was " determined to keep it running full as long as I did last time by the help of John Borne [ sic ] with much ease to the Dear Child:__entity__ " . ' 5 She

continued with the blister and applied " ointment with flyes " , apparently some sort of irritant potion , with no sign of strangury .
Charles found her treatment " not near the pain he expected " and she was " full of hopes that he will rec [ eiv ] e great benefit from it " . 1
Apart from his other troubles , one of Charles ' s knees had swollen but this had much abated since the application of the blisters which Lady Malton believed " must be acting upon the whole Mass of Blood " since it had " reached the remote part " .
She thought that Sir Edward Hulse ' s powders were too slow in taking effect although the boy:__entity__ took them very quietly . ' 7 Sir Edward did not " apprehend any great danger from the Siziness [ thickness ] of Charles ' blood " ; Lady Malton thought that the condition was the cause of all the child:__entity__ ' s problems , which would not end until it was set to rights .
At any rate , he was fit enough to go hunting . ' 8 Charles continued in the same state of health .
He slept well at night , ate more than his mother thought was good for him , and was able to exercise strenuously without tiring .
He put on no weight though , and " as for them swellings at his throat , they are almost gone one day and rise the next " .
His mother did not expect a speedy recovery and " if the D [ octo ] rs think him in a good state of health now , I s [ houl ] d be glad to see him in a better " . ' 9 He began to improve and by the end of November even she thought he was on the mend and gaining weight . 20 Unfortunately , Lady Malton again had cause for concern over his health in January 1742 when he began to suffer from an intermittent hoarseness . 2 ' Otherwise he was as well as one could expect , with no other complaints . 22 It was not to last .
In May 1742 Charles and his mother were again in Bristol , taking the waters because he had been indisposed .
Lady Malton thought the waters were doing them good because they were both being violently sick . 23 However , Charles had had no dinner on 25 or 26 May and was hot , lazy , and inclined to stir , " from which I conclude he is not well , .
. . and therefore Intend to give him a gentle Vomit . . . and to let him take his old Remedie the Salt Draughts for a few Daies which I dare say will set him quite to rights " . 24 By 29 May Dr Boume had bled the boy:__entity__ " which succeeded very well but . . . found it [ his blood ] as bad as ever " .
The waters were not working " but there is a great deal for them to do which grant God they may effect " .
The weather had turned warm so Lady Malton had " shorn him . . . which has display ' d a most scabby head and indeed several other untoward Blotches he has out upon other parts of his Body " , which made her uneasy . 25 The blotches on his head were not numerous " yet they made up in quality for so virulent a Corrosive Humour is not easily conceived without seeing it " .
The pustules on his body were of the same sort

and his mother intended to put plasters on them to prevent them from spreading .
Charles was also feverish ; his glands were swollen and his pulse was erratic " but out of compassion to you I must tell you that he is with me as Brisk and lively as you ever Saw him " .
Lady Malton had called in two eminent Bristol men:__entity__ , Dr Logan and Mr Pye , to treat the boy:__entity__ ; Mr Pye prescribed " the Precipitate Per se " as the cure for the " hectic " .
Pye made it himself and said that it was the only remedy that would work .
Clearly Charles was impatient to be cured because he told his mother to give him the medicine " to cure me which I am sure it will do or shoot me through the head at once " .
She thought that this attitude was " odd from one of his Age and [ it ] does not a little disturb " . 26 The blotches began to burst and indent but the doctor thought that all would be well in the end . 27 Meanwhile , Charles was still losing weight even though " he had none to spare before " and he was inclined to be lazy which was not his natural turn .
His father recommended some unknown cure which he called Gascoin ' s Powder - a dose of five grains made up with syrup into a pill - every night .
To make matters worse , the doctors disagreed about the treatment .
" Dr Pye is Vehemently for the P .
Per se , Dr Logan saies that it is a Medicine that may prove too rough in its operation for his Constitution & therefore begs a tryal of Beazor mineral [ gall stones from a goat:__entity__ ] and Viper Broth " .
The Bristol water had not yet acted " because his case is of too obstinate a Nature " and Lady Malton herself was satisfied that since nothing else had worked to cure the boy:__entity__ , the time had come to try mercurials , even though she knew that they were " powerful and perhaps in some cases hazardous medicines " . 28 She wanted to see some remedy succeed but was " afraid of violent ones and at the same time vastly distrustfull [ sic ] of mild ones " .
It would appear that the " precipitate Per se " , probably mercury - based , could be a kill - or - cure remedy .
Her " terrors " did not arise from any immediate danger to her son , and her " perfect Knowledge " of his disorder convinced her that whatever remedies he took , the cure was in the hands of God . 29
To add to Charles ' disorders , on 12 June he developed a " very inflamed bad Eye . . . the same Eye that . . .
he did not see so well of [ as ] the other . . .
He sais [ sic ] that from that eye Alone he can Scarcely distinguish anything " .
The doctors suggested bathing the eye : Lady Malton knew that the " frightful symptoms " which were " shocking to behold " were a result of " the Same as produces all the rest of his complaints in whichever Shape they appear " .
30 The eye was very bloodshot and inflamed ; the eyelid was swollen so he could hardly open it .
The other eye was dull and " he had very little sight of it " . 31 By 14 June the eye problem had eased somewhat but Lady Malton could find no cause to attribute the improvement to any of the " cures " .
Charles was still being subjected to Bristol water , Beazor mineral , Viper broth , cinnabar and the precipitate per se . 32 She decided to take the boy:__entity__ home to Wentworth because he was

more likely to recover there than anywhere else . 33 He still ate and slept well and was " pretty cheerful but his looks are bitter bad still .
The flesh he lost in the Accidental Feavour he has not Recover ' d and his complexion is of the most sickly sort his hands of the same Hue his legs are tollerable [ sic ] well " . 34
They returned to Wentworth in short stages and by 6 September Higham was " perfectly recovered .
. . after the long and successful Care that Lady Malton has taken " of him . 35 In May 1743 he was inoculated against smallpox:__entity__ and made a perfect recovery after which he caught cold " by stripping when He was hot " . 36 Lord Higham does not seem to have been seriously ill after that until , at the age of 19 , he undertook his Grand Tour in 1749 .
In July 1750 , by then Lord Malton , he had cause to consult Nicolo Scanagati in Padua for the treatment of gonorrhoea .
Scanagati produced a lengthy medical report of Malton ' s treatment , presumably for his English doctor ' s enlightenment . 37 The initial treatment was an " electuary , consisting of three ounces of emollient , three drams of powdered jalap:__entity__ , a half [ dram ] of purified nitre , bound together with lemon:__entity__ juice taken twice a day " .
The result was satisfactory : " The dark greenish poison was oozing slowly from his penis , which was all contracted and the sharp and constant pain extended from the perineum up to the urinary bladder , producing small swellings now in this place , now in that . " There was a fierce burning sensation in the glands , which prevented him from sleeping .
Because of this , it seemed reasonable to bathe that part in tepid water and milk , and to apply poultices to the areas affected by swelling and contractions , together with cold drinks and a few grains of laudanum at night .
Malton was blooded regularly besides being given purgatives ; the treatment then moved on to the administration of mercury , both internal and on the gums , since it was widely believed at the time that gonorrhoea and syphilis were steps of the same disease , " the Venereal " .
Scanagati at this point ruled out the suggestion of syphilitic chancre because Malton ' s urine was fine and light with a pungent odour .
Scanagati did ask if Malton had previously ever had a similar peculiarity of his urine .
Malton replied that when he was very young and still inexperienced sexually , for some time following a fever he had had the same unusual urine , and indeed that on one occasion this symptom coincided with certain tumours on the testicles .
It was only by chance that he had not had recourse to surgery , the reason being that he was also afflicted with a throat infection - to which he was prone - and therefore had his vein opened four times .
Thereupon the inflammation subsided , and equally the tumours and sediment disappeared .
He told me that as a youth he had sometimes experienced some difficulty and a burning sensation when urinating , which subsided when his blood was let and with the application of poultices .
I observed that from time to time his face and body were covered with purplish spots , which , having produced a little fluid , would disappearas indeed happened in the course of the cure , at the end of which his face was entirely

free from these spots .
From this observation , it seemed to me simple to deduce both the original cause and the more immediate cause of the said sediment : namely a natural complexion of humours which are exacerbated by muriatic [ i . e . , acidic ] sourness , together with the marked inflammation of the blood and the motion of the contracted poison .
Scanagati then recommended the continuation of the electuary made of emollient , guaiacum resin , balsam , rhubarb:__entity__ , and nitre .
What does all this add up to in terms of diagnosis ?
The early illness is a mystery .
Did he have an inguinal hernia ; or perhaps mumps or epididymitis ?
His was a childless marriage .
He seems to have been too fit for the illness to have been rheumatic fever .
Cystitis was not uncommon and this could certainly lead to " strangury " .
Perhaps Rockingham suffered from a congenital defect of his urinogenitary system which would result in recurrent attacks of cystitis and might cause long - term damage to the urinary tract and eventual destruction of the kidneys , precipitating sudden and unexpected death .
Another possibility might be diabetes .
Rockingham had a urinary infection and certainly suffered from recurrent skin infections , although it appears from Scanagati ' s report that these cleared up when mercury was administered .
Certainly the marquis complained often about pains in his side and stomach and made no secret of his " old complaint " .
He was noticeably less physically active as he moved into his thirties and only occasionally exerted himself by riding any distance , even though he had enjoyed hunting when he was younger .
He found the pains caused by his " old complaint " made him feel so ill that he was unable to concentrate on " any Manner of Business " and on occasion it seemed likely to prevent him from attending Parliament . 38 He may well have suffered from a problem with gallstones from an early age . 39 He appears to have suffered from a nervous disorder which manifested itself in severe palpitations , trembling , and other types of physical discomforts such as boils and headaches with which he was frequently afflicted . 40 He probably had constipation too , since he was always dosing himself with purgatives .
In fact in April 1772 the Duke of Richmond decided that Rockingham ' s real problem was a " surfeit of physick " 41 although Edmund Burke noted in June 1772 that the marquis had had a long and severe illness . 42 Whatever his many and varied ailments , Rockingham survived until he was 52 in spite of the attentions of both doctors and quacks and that , for the mid - eighteenth century , was a good age .
The mystery still remains , however .
Contemporary opinion had it that he died of pneumonia but it must have struck

suddenly : it was only two weeks from him " recovering " to dying .
Another almost contemporary account of the marquis ' s death came from the Earl of Albemarle .
He noted that Rockingham had " for some time past been afflicted with water on the chest : and to this well - known malady was superadded the then novel disease of influenza " . 43 This conceivably could be an uninformed account , handed down orally by surviving members of the marquis ' s family , of emphysema .
More fascinating than the diagnosis of the cause of death , however , is - what was wrong with him during his lifetime ?
Or is it yet another example of the " English disease " : hypochondria ?

Tissue - dependent isoforms of mammalian Fox - 1 homologs are associated with tissue - specific splicing activities
Abstract
An intronic hexanucleotide UGCAUG has been shown to play a critical role in the regulation of tissue - specific alternative splicing of pre - mRNAs in a wide range of tissues .
Vertebrate Fox - 1 has been shown to bind to this element , in a highly sequence - specific manner , through its RNA recognition motif ( RRM ) .
In mammals , there are at least two Fox - 1 - related genes , ataxin - 2 binding protein 1 ( A2BP1 ) / Fox - 1 and Fxh / Rbm9 , which encode an identical RRM .
Here , we demonstrate that both mouse:__entity__ Fxh and A2BP1 transcripts undergo tissue - specific alternative splicing , generating protein isoforms specific to brain and muscle .
These tissue - specific isoforms are characterized for their abilities to regulate neural cell - specific alternative splicing of a cassette exon , N30 , in the non - muscle myosin heavy chain II - B pre - mRNA , previously shown to be regulated through an intronic distal downstream enhancer ( IDDE ) .
All Fxh and A2BP1 isoforms with the RRM are capable of binding to the IDDE in vitro through the UGCAUG elements .
Each isoform , however , shows quantitative differences in splicing activity and nuclear distribution in transfected cells .
All Fxh isoforms and a brain isoform of A2BP1 show a predominant nuclear localization .
Brain isoforms of both Fxh and A2BP1 promote N30 splicing much more efficiently than do the muscle - specific isoforms .
Skeletal muscles express additional isoforms that lack a part of the RRM .
These isoforms are incapable of activating neural cell - specific splicing and , moreover , can inhibit UGCAUG - dependent N30 splicing .
These findings suggest that tissue - specific isoforms of Fxh and A2BP1 play an important role in determining tissue specificity of UGCAUG - mediated alternative splicing .
INTRODUCTION
Alternative splicing of pre - mRNA is one of the fundamental mechanisms for the regulation of gene expression in higher eukaryotes ( 1 , 2 ) .
Developmentally regulated , cell type - or tissue - specific , and signal - induced alternative splicing of pre - mRNAs takes place in multicellular organisms throughout their lifetimes .
Misregulation or abnormalities in pre - mRNA splicing , in some instances , leads to cellular dysfunctions found in human:__entity__ and animal diseases ( 3 - 5 ) .
Using various model systems of regulated alternative splicing , a number of pre - mRNA features that influence alternative splice site selection have been defined ( 1 , 2 ) .
These include enhancer and repressor RNA sequences located in exons and introns .
Identification of RNA - binding proteins targeting these cis - regulatory elements is currently in progress .
In vertebrates , participation of the SR family proteins and hnRNP proteins , such as PTB and hnRNPA1 , in alternative splicing regulation via binding to the cis - regulatory elements have been shown in many tissue - specific splicing models ( 6 , 7 ) .
Although these RNA - binding proteins are ubiquitously expressed , their different abundance in different cells , differences in their post - translational modifications in different cellular contexts and their different abilities to assemble multiprotein complexes in different pre - mRNA contexts are thought to contribute to the determination of cell type - specific patterns of alternative splicing .
For the last few years , tissue - specific and tissue - enriched RNA - binding proteins have begun to be identified as splicing regulators .
These include brain - specific ( or enriched ) Nova - 1 , nPTB ( brPTB ) and some of the CELF family proteins ( 8 - 12 ) .
Discovery of these proteins has had a great impact on studies aimed at understanding the molecular mechanisms of alternative splicing regulation .
One of the intronic cis - elements , which are involved in tissue - specific or differentiation stage - dependent regulation of alternative splicing , is the hexanucleotide UGCAUG .
The importance of this element was originally recognized in fibronectin pre - mRNA by Huh and Hynes ( 13 ) .
Since then , alternative splicing specific to a variety of tissues or cell types , including neural cells , muscles , epithelial cells and erythrocytes , has been shown to be modulated via this element ( 14 - 21 ) .
Recently , Jin et al .
( 21 ) discovered that a zebrafish:__entity__ homolog of Caenorhabditis:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ Fox - 1 ( 22 ) could bind specifically to the pentanucleotide GCAUG by in vitro selection from randomized RNA sequences .
This pentanucleotide is almost identical to the hexanucleotide UGCAUG except for the first U .
Moreover , the zebrafish:__entity__ Fox - 1 homolog , as well as the mouse:__entity__ Fox - 1 homolog , are capable of repressing the inclusion of an alternative cassette exon of the ATP synthase F1 gamma pre - mRNA via binding to GCAUG , which mimics muscle - specific exclusion of this exon .
This mouse:__entity__ homolog is identical to the ataxin - 2 binding protein 1 ( A2BP1 ) , which has been previously cloned in humans:__entity__ and mice:__entity__ as the cDNA encoding a protein , which interacts with ataxin - 2 , the product of the causative gene for spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 ( 23 , 24 ) .
In addition to A2BP1 / Fox - 1 , another mouse:__entity__ homolog of C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ Fox - 1 , Fxh , has been independently cloned as a cDNA , which is induced by androgen in motor neurons ( 25 ) .
Of note is that A2BP1 / Fox - 1 and Fxh share an identical RNA recognition motif ( RRM ) at the amino acid level .
Therefore , two genes in the mouse:__entity__ genome encode homologs of nematode Fox - 1 .
According to the names given by the first cDNA cloning , we used the nomenclature of A2BP1 and Fxh in this report .
A2BP1 and Fxh have been named A2BP1 and Rbm9 , respectively , in the human:__entity__ and mouse:__entity__ genomes .
We have been studying regulatory mechanisms of neural cell - specific alternative splicing using the non - muscle myosin heavy chain II - B ( NMHC - B ) gene as a model system ( 14 , 26 ) .
NMHC - B mRNA is expressed ubiquitously .
However , an alternative exon , N30 , which encodes a 30 nt coding sequence , is included in the mRNAs from some neural cells , but is skipped in those from all other cells in mammals and birds ( 27 , 28 ) .
In cultured cells , a switch in N30 splicing from exclusion to inclusion can be seen in neural retinoblastoma Y79 cells during the post - mitotic and differentiated stages triggered by butyrate treatment .
We have previously defined an intronic distal downstream enhancer ( IDDE ) , which confers neural cell specificity on N30 inclusion , using this cell line ( 14 ) .
The IDDE includes two copies of UGCAUG .
Mutation of these hexanucleotides results in N30 skipping in post - mitotic differentiated Y79 cells .
In this study , we investigated the possible involvement of A2BP1 and Fxh in the regulation of N30 splicing .
To this end , we have isolated cDNA clones for A2BP1 and Fxh from brain and muscles .
cDNA cloning revealed the existence of tissue - specific ( enriched ) isoforms of both A2BP1 and Fxh .
Of importance , different isoforms of A2BP1 and Fxh show different activities with respect to N30 splicing as well as different subcellular localizations .

RESULTS
Tissue - dependent isoforms of Fxh and A2BP1 and their subcellular distribution
The A2BP1 mRNAs are detected almost exclusively in brain and striated muscles ( heart and skeletal muscles ) in adult mice:__entity__ , whereas the Fxh mRNAs are expressed in a wide variety of tissues with the highest expression in brain and heart [ ( 21 , 25 ) and S . Kawamoto , unpublished data ] .
These expression profiles prompted us to characterize the mRNAs of A2BP1 and Fxh in brain and muscles .
We have cloned cDNAs for two gene transcripts from brain , heart and skeletal muscles by RT - PCR and 5 ' RACE .
The isolated cDNAs are schematically presented with genomic structures in Figure 1 ( for amino acid sequences see also Figure 8 ) .
Both gene transcripts are found to undergo tissue - specific alternative splicing .
In both cases , brain and striated muscles express unique splice variants generated by mutually exclusive splicing of exons B40 and M43 , respectively , which provide different coding sequences in the middle of the carboxyl half of the molecules .
Southern blot analysis of the RT - PCR products of the Fxh mRNAs from the different tissues probed by oligonucleotides corresponding to B40 and M43 shows that M43 is exclusively used in heart and skeletal muscles , while B40 is predominantly used in brain ( Figure 2A ) .
Digestion of the RT - PCR products of the A2BP1 mRNAs with restriction enzymes unique to B40 and M43 demonstrates that B40 and M43 are used almost exclusively in brain and muscles , respectively ( Figure 2B ) .
A2BP1 contains an additional cassette type alternative exon A53 , consisting of 53 nt .
Inclusion and exclusion of exon A53 results in two different amino acid sequences at the C - terminal region owing to a frame shift .
In the case of the A2BP1 gene , moreover , it appears that brain and striated muscle utilize alternative promoters , resulting in different amino acid sequences at the N - terminus .
The 5 ' RACE of skeletal muscle mRNAs yielded essentially a single species of sequence with 29 unique N - terminal amino acids .
The 5 ' RACE using brain mRNAs ; however , yielded multiple products with multiple deduced amino acid sequences , all of which differ from the muscle amino acid sequence at the very N - terminus .
Here , we focus our analysis on a clone containing nine unique amino acids at the N - terminus , which was obtained most frequently .
Exon - intron organization of Fxh and A2BP1 shows remarkable similarities and a RRM is encoded in four exons ( Figure 1B ) .
Of note is that the significant amounts of Fxh and A2BP1 mRNAs from skeletal muscles are missing a part of the RRM by exon skipping .
Typically , as shown in Figure 2C , they lack the 93 nt exon that encodes RNP1 , one of the two most critical motifs of the RRM ( 30 ) .
Some of them lack almost the entire RRM ( e . g . F402 in Figure 1A ) .
To examine the subcellular distribution of each isoform of Fxh and A2BP1 , myc - tagged proteins were transiently expressed in cultured cells and immunostained with an anti - myc antibody .
Initially , HeLa cells were used to investigate subcellular localization , since these cells are more suited for these studies .
Representative confocal images are shown in Figure 3A .
DAPI and anti - NMHC - B antibodies serve as markers for nuclei and cytoplasm , respectively .
As noted , the ratio of protein distributed between nuclei and cytoplasm differs among the proteins .
All isoforms of Fxh have a predominant nuclear localization .
The brain isoform of A2BP1 without the A53 exon ( A016 ) localizes to both nuclei and cytoplasm , whereas the other brain isoform with the A53 exon ( A030 ) localizes predominantly to cytoplasm with only a minimum being in the nuclei .
The relative amounts of both muscle isoforms of A2BP1 ( A713 and A715 ) are somewhat between the amounts of the two brain isoforms .
These data are summarized in Figure 1A .
The subcellular distribution of representative isoforms ( F011 , A016 and A030 ) was also examined in retinoblastoma Y79 cells , which were used as host cells for the transfection experiments in order to characterize splicing activities of Fxh and A2BP proteins ( see below ) .
Although Y79 cells have a spherical shape and have only thin cytoplasm , exogenously expressed isoforms of Fxh and A2BP1 show a similar subcellular distribution as in HeLa cells ( Figure 3B ) .
F011 localizes predominantly to nuclei , A016 to both nuclei and cytoplasm and A030 predominantly to cytoplasm .
Specific interaction of Fxh and A2BP1 with IDDE via a hexanucleotide UGCAUG
Fxh and A2BP1 share an identical RRM and A2BP1 has been reported to bind specifically to the pentanucleotide GCAUG through this RRM ( 21 ) .
We have previously reported that the IDDE of the NMHC - B transcript , which is indispensable for the regulation of neural cell - specific cassette type exon N30 splicing , has two copies of GCAUG ( 14 ) .
Therefore , we investigated whether Fxh and / or A2BP1 bound to the IDDE .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) were carried out using labeled IDDE and in vitro transcribed and translated Fxh and A2BP1 , which include a myc - epitope .
Since all Fxh and A2BP1 isoforms , except F402 and A704 , contain the identical RRM , representative isoforms were analyzed .
The expression of F011 in reticulocyte lysate causes the formation of a RNA - protein complex whose migration shift distinguishes it from those of the control reticulocyte lysate ( C in Figure 4B , lanes 3 and 10 ) .
The unlabeled wild - type IDDE competes with the probe efficiently for the formation of the specific complex C ( Figure 4B , lane 4 ) .
On the other hand , the mutant mc ( Figure 4A ) , which has a mutation in both copies of UGCAUG , does not ( Figure 4B , lane 7 ) .
The mutant ma , which has a mutation in the hexanucleotide at the 5 ' side , shows less efficient competition , compared with mb , which has a mutation in the 3 ' side of the hexanucleotide ( Figure 4B , lanes 5 and 6 ) , indicating that the nucleotides at the 5 ' side are more important than those at the 3 ' side .
The presence of an anti - myc antibody , but not a non - specific antibody , inhibits the formation of the specific complex ( Figure 4B , lane 8 ) .
Synthesis of the full - length F011 protein using a reticulocyte lysate and specificity of the myc antibody for the expressed protein are verified by immunoblot analysis ( Figure 4B , lanes 11 and 12 ) .
A016 and A030 show essentially identical results to those with F011 ( data not shown ) .
These results indicate that Fxh and A2BP1 can bind to the IDDE and that the hexanucleotide UGCAUG is required for their binding .
Fxh and A2BP1 enhance N30 inclusion in a UGCAUG - dependent manner
To study whether Fxh and A2BP1 regulate neural cell - specific splicing via binding to UGCAUG , the Fxh and A2BP1 expression constructs were co - transfected into retinoblastoma Y79 cells with a number of the reporter minigene constructs , which include the wild - type or a mutant version of UGCAUG in the IDDE ( Figure 4A ) .
Minigenes H and J consist of the exons E5 , N30 and E6 and their flanking introns with some deletions in the introns .
The IDDE with or without mutations in the hexanucleotide is included or excluded between N30 and E6 .
As described above , each isoform of Fxh and A2BP1 enters the nucleus to a different extent .
To see the effects of different proteins on N30 splicing itself , independent of their differential properties in nuclear localization , an exogenous NLS was added to the expressed proteins .
Since Fxh and A2BP1 proteins contain the identical RRM , and F011 , A016 and A030 all show the same UGCAUG - dependent binding to the IDDE in vitro , F011 and A030 were used for these experiments .
Host cells Y79 at the proliferating stage exclude the N30 exon in ~ 90 % of the endogenous NMHC - B mRNAs ( e . g . see Figure 6A , lane 1 ) .
As shown in Figure 4C , the mRNAs derived from minigene J exclude N30 without exogenous expression of Fxh or A2BP1 in Y79 cells , similar to the endogenous NMHC - B mRNAs ( Figure 4C , upper panel , lanes 1 - 5 ) .
However , in the presence of exogenous expression of F011 and A030 , the N30 inclusion is increased ( Figure 4C , upper panel , lanes 7 and 12 ) .
The N30 inclusion is absolutely dependent on the presence of the IDDE ( Figure 4C , upper panel , lanes 6 and 11 ) .
Moreover , mutation of either one of the two copies of UGCAUG ( ma , mb ) abolishes the inclusion of N30 ( Figure 4C , upper panel , lanes 8 - 10 , 13 - 15 ) .
In the context of minigene H , which contains shorter introns , the larger extent of N30 inclusion is induced by either F011 or A030 overexpression ( Figure 4C , middle panel , lanes 7 and 12 ) .
The N30 inclusion of the minigene H mRNAs also depends on the presence of the IDDE ( Figure 4C , middle panel , lanes 6 and 11 ) .
Mutation of both copies of UGCAUG ( mc ) results in a complete loss of N30 inclusion ( Figure 4C , middle panel , lanes 10 and 15 ) .
The mutant ma shows stronger inhibition of N30 inclusion compared with mb ( Figure 4C , middle panel , lanes 8 and 9 ) .
This observation is consistent with the competition experiments of the EMSA shown in Figure 4B , indicating that the 5 ' hexanucleotide is more important than the 3 ' hexanucleotide for binding of Fxh or A2BP1 to the IDDE as well as an activation of N30 splicing .
Comparable amounts of F011 and A030 are expressed in each transfection as verified by immunoblots using an anti - myc antibody ( Figure 4C , lower panel , lanes 6 - 17 ) .
Since minigenes J and H lack a portion of the intron between exons N30 and E6 and , therefore , the IDDE is located ~ 100 nt downstream of N30 , instead of 1 . 5 kb as in the native gene , we also analyzed the effects of Fxh and A2BP1 on the N30 splicing of the wild - type minigene G , which includes full - length introns among E5 , N30 and E6 ( Figure 4A ) .
As shown in Figure 4C ( right panel ) , both F011 and A030 are capable of promoting N30 inclusion , with F011 showing a higher activity ( Figure 4C , lanes 16 and 17 ) .
Although A030 can promote N30 inclusion as efficiently as F011 in the contexts of the minigene J and H transcripts , it can do so less efficiently than F011 in the context of the minigene G transcript .
Interpretation of this observation will be discussed below .
Taken together , Fxh and A2BP1 can activate N30 inclusion in an IDDE - dependent manner .
The hexanucleotide motif UGCAUG is indispensable for this activation .
Differential activities of alternatively spliced isoforms of Fxh and A2BP1 in promoting N30 inclusion
Both Fxh and A2BP1 mRNAs are expressed in brain and A2BP1 is also expressed in striated muscles and Fxh is expressed in an even wider variety of tissues .
As demonstrated above , however , both Fxh and A2BP1 transcripts undergo tissue - dependent alternative splicing , producing muscle - specific and brain - enriched isoforms .
Therefore , the relative activity of individual isoform of Fxh and A2BP1 in promoting N30 inclusion was compared using minigene G .
First , in order to evaluate the relative specific activity of each isoform in the splicing reaction separately from its ability to localize to nuclei , an exogenous NLS was included in the expressed protein to equalize the nuclear concentration of the expressed protein in these experiments .
Essentially , all of the expressed proteins with the exogenous NLS are localized to the nucleus ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , the relative nuclear concentrations of the expressed proteins can be estimated easily by immunoblots .
As shown in immunoblots in Figure 5A , similar quantities of proteins are expressed in a dose - dependent manner .
Expression of the brain isoform F011 causes a dose - dependent increase in N30 inclusion and the extent of N30 inclusion reaches a plateau with ~ 85 % of the mRNAs including N30 .
In contrast , inclusion of N30 promoted by F411 , the predominant isoform from skeletal muscles , reaches a plateau with only 40 % of the mRNAs .
With respect to A2BP1 , the brain isoform A030 shows higher activity in N30 inclusion than the muscle isoform A715 , which shows almost no activation , as shown in Figure 5A .
Including additional isoforms , the activities of individual isoforms with an exogenous NLS in promoting N30 inclusion are shown in Figure 5B ( lanes 8 - 13 ) and are also summarized in Figure 1A ( nls ) .
Special care was taken to ensure that a similar quantity of each protein was expressed and , if not , different amounts were tested to obtain comparable expression .
In the presence of the exogenous NLS ( nls ) , F011 and A016 show the highest activities among all isoforms tested .
A30 shows a considerably lower activity than A016 .
Each of the muscle isoforms ( F411 , A713 and A715 ) has a lower activity than that of their brain counterparts ( F011 , A016 and A030 , respectively ) .
As expected , isoforms lacking a part or all of the RRM ( F402 and A704 ) have no activity for N30 inclusion .
Next , the splicing activities of the wild - type proteins without an exogenous NLS were examined .
Representative data are shown in Figure 5B ( lanes 2 - 7 ) and the relative activities are summarized in Figure 1A ( wt ) .
The protein amounts detected by immunoblots in these experiments represent the total amounts of the proteins distributed to both the nuclei and the cytoplasm .
The splicing activities of the wild - type proteins are consistent with the activities that combine the splicing activities of the proteins with the exogenous NLS and the activities of the native proteins to localize to nuclei .
In the absence of the exogenous NLS ( wt ) , the brain isoforms F011 , and A016 to a lesser extent , are still capable of activating N30 inclusion efficiently .
The muscle isoforms for both Fxh and A2BP1 ( F411 , A713 and A715 ) , as well as the brain isoform A030 , show only minimal activities .
Therefore , F011 and A016 appear to have the most physiological relevance to N30 splicing activation .
Overexpression of Fxh and A2BP1 activates N30 inclusion of endogenous NMHC - B mRNAs
The human:__entity__ NMHC - B gene consists of 41 constitutive exons and 3 alternative exons .
Its pre - mRNA is ~ 156 kb in length and it is much more complex than the pre - mRNA from the minigenes .
In addition , the minigene pre - mRNAs are driven by a heterologous promoter .
Therefore , we next examined if Fxh and A2BP1 were capable of promoting N30 inclusion of the endogenous transcript .
Y79 cells were stably transfected with the expression construct for F011 or A016 .
Both F011 and A016 are enriched in the brain and show higher activation of N30 inclusion in the minigene transcripts .
mRNAs encoding endogenous NMHC - B were analyzed by using RT - PCR .
As shown in Figure 6 , the inclusion of exon N30 with and without another alternative exon , R18 , in the endogenous mRNAs is markedly increased in the clones which were stably transfected with the construct for F011 or A016 containing an exogenous NLS ( Figure 6 , lanes 4 and 5 ) .
Although to a lesser extent , transfection of the wild - type constructs without an exogenous NLS also results in a significant increase in N30 inclusion ( Figure 6 , lanes 2 and 3 ) .
Thus , exogenously expressed Fxh and A2BP1 are capable of activating N30 inclusion not only in the transcripts from the minigenes , but also in those from the native NMHC - B gene in Y79 cells .
Fxh may cooperate with other factor ( s ) to promote N30 inclusion
To address the role of endogenous Fxh and its potential interaction with other proteins in promoting N30 inclusion , we made use of an isoform of Fxh , F402 , which lacks the RRM .
The mutant proteins lacking an RRM for other RNA - binding proteins have previously been reported to function in a dominant - negative fashion and inhibit the activities of the wild - type proteins ( 26 , 31 ) .
Therefore , the effects of F402 on the N30 inclusion of minigene H mRNAs were examined in the context of the Y79 cells treated with butyrate .
Upon butyrate treatment , as reported previously , Y79 cells enter in a post - mitotic and differentiated stage , and importantly , the endogenous as well as the minigene mRNAs in those cells include N30 to a large extent , unlike those in the untreated cells that predominantly exclude N30 ( 14 ) .
As shown in Figure 7 , in the absence of exogenous expression of F402 , large quantities of the mRNAs derived from minigene H - wt , which contains the wild - type IDDE , include N30 ( Figure 7 , upper panel , lane 4 ) .
In contrast , only small quantities of N30 inclusion are detected in the mRNAs from minigene H - mc , which has mutations in both copies of UGCAUG in the IDDE ( Figure 7 , upper panel , lane 8 ) .
Therefore , the butyrate - treated Y79 cells contain factor ( s ) , which are capable of activating the UGCAUG - dependent N30 inclusion .
Co - transfection of the wild - type minigene H - wt with the F402 expression construct causes a dose - dependent inhibition of N30 inclusion ( Figure 7 , lanes 1 - 3 ) , indicating that F402 has an antagonistic effect on the endogenous factors with respect to N30 inclusion .
Notably , the UGCAUG - independent N30 inclusion seen in the mutant minigene H - mc is not affected by the co - expression of F402 ( Figure 7 , lanes 5 - 7 ) , indicating that the inhibitory activity of F402 depends on the UGCAUG element .
The parallel experiment with the F011 expression construct does not show a significant effect on N30 splicing in either the wild - type or mutant minigene ( Figure 7 , lanes 9 - 16 ) .
This may be due to the fact that N30 inclusion of the wild - type minigene mRNAs has already reached a maximal level and is consistent with the idea that butyrate - treated Y79 cells contain sufficient amounts of protein ( s ) functionally equivalent to F011 , which can promote N30 inclusion in a UGCAUG - dependent manner .
Since F402 does not bind to the UGCAUG element , and has a UGCAUG - dependent antagonistic effect on N30 splicing , it most probably disrupts protein - protein interactions of the endogenous proteins that are required for the UGCAUG - dependent activation of N30 splicing .
Endogenous Fxh ( and / or A2BP1 ) would be a good candidate whose function could be antagonized by exogenously expressed F402 .
Thus , this observation suggests that the endogenous Fxh has an effect on the activation of N30 splicing and that other proteins cooperate with Fxh for N30 activation .
Since muscle cells express the RRM - defective isoforms to a significant extent ( Figure 2C ) and the wild - type F402 localize to nuclei efficiently , this also raises the possibility that the RRM - defective isoforms may have an inhibitory function on the N30 splicing in muscle cells .
DISCUSSION
Two major findings are described in this report .
First , Fxh and A2BP1 facilitate neural cell - specific inclusion of the cassette - type exon via binding to the specific intronic sequence UGCAUG .
In addition to a minigene model system , Fxh and A2BP1 are capable of facilitating N30 inclusion of the endogenous pre - mRNA .
This result provides an important demonstration of physiological relevance and supports the notion that the NMHC - B pre - mRNA is likely to be the true target for Fxh or A2BP1 - mediated regulation .
However , whether the endogenous Fxh or A2BP1 regulates endogenous NMHC - B pre - mRNA splicing needs to be determined in a future study .
In vertebrates , small interfering RNAs and gene targeting strategies have recently been used successfully to address the roles of endogenous splicing regulators in alternative splicing of endogenous target pre - mRNAs ( 8 , 32 - 36 ) .
A second and more novel finding is the identification of tissue - specific isoforms of Fxh and A2BP1 with different splicing activities as well as different subcellular localizations .
This finding raises the possibility that the products of the Fxh and A2BP1 genes can contribute to a mechanism as to how tissue specificity of alternative splicing is achieved .
Many splicing factors are detected not only in the nuclei , but also in the cytoplasm ( 37 ) .
They are shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and , in some instances , extracellular stimuli trigger changes in subcellular distribution of these proteins .
Such translocations have been reported for hnRNPA1 and PTB ( 38 , 39 ) .
Moreover , a number of RNA - binding proteins have been demonstrated to play a role in multiple steps during gene expression in different subcellular compartments , such as pre - mRNA processing in nuclei , mRNA export from nuclei to cytoplasm and mRNA localization , stability and translation in cytoplasm ( 37 , 40 ) .
Therefore , not surprisingly , Fxh and A2BP1 isoforms were found to be distributed in both the nuclei and the cytoplasm in HeLa and Y79 cells .
However , the relative ratios of proteins distributed between the two subcellular compartments at steady - state differ among the isoforms .
In agreement with Jin et al .
( 21 ) , substantial amounts of the brain isoform A016 are detected in nuclei .
Other A2BP1 isoforms , the brain isoform A030 and the muscle isoforms A713 and A715 , are only poorly detected in nuclei .
This observation is consistent with the reports where endogenous A2BP1 in cerebellar Purkinje cells , hippocampus neurons and cardiac myocytes were shown to be localized essentially to the cytoplasm ( 23 , 24 ) .
Thus , inclusion and exclusion of A53 and differences in the very N - terminal sequences results in A2BP1 isoforms with a distinct subcellular localization .
It is likely that A2BP1 proteins have multiple roles , involving both nuclear and cytoplasmic events .
In contrast , all three Fxh isoforms predominantly localized to the nuclei .
Therefore , in terms of their localization , Fxh proteins are better candidates for regulators of the pre - mRNA splicing that takes place in nuclei .
Of note , however , our preliminary results of 5 ' RACE , as well as the EST database , detect multiple 5 ' end sequences for both Fxh and A2BP1 mRNAs , which are presumably generated by alternative promoters and alternative splicing .
The diversity of the 5 ' end cDNA sequences leads to the generation of a number of unique N - terminal amino acid sequences .
Therefore , this study does not exclude the possible existence of other isoforms with different subcellular localizations for both Fxh and A2BP1 .
Our study also does not exclude the possibility that some of the isoforms translocate between the nucleus and the cytoplasm following stimuli .
The main aim of this study is to determine the relative activities of tissue - dependent isoforms of Fxh and A2BP1 in neural cell - specific and UGCAUG element - dependent alternative splicing .
To obtain an indication of the relative specific activity of each isoform in transfected cells , the same amounts of the expressed proteins should be available for the splicing reaction in the nuclei .
For this reason , an exogenous NLS was included in the expressed proteins .
Essentially , all of the expressed proteins with the exogenous NLS localized to nuclei .
Thus , the amounts of the expressed proteins determined by immunoblots represent the nuclear concentrations .
The analysis using the proteins expressed with the exogenous NLS allowed us to compare directly the splicing activities of these proteins .
Furthermore , this analysis also allowed us to define the critical regions of the proteins for splicing activation .
As shown in Figure 5 , the splicing activities of the various isoforms of Fxh and A2BP1 are intrinsically different , regardless of the subcellular localization properties of the wild - type proteins .
Among the isoforms tested in this study , F011 and A016 , which include B40 , are found to have higher activities in promoting N30 inclusion .
When the primary amino acid sequences , outside of the RRM , of these two proteins are compared , the C - terminal regions ( amino acids 190 - 377 of F011 ) show a higher homology with 71 % identity , whereas the N - terminal regions ( amino acids 1 - 112 of F011 ) show only 53 % identity .
The C - terminal region includes four subregions of nearly identical stretches of amino acids ( Figure 8 , I - IV ) .
One subregion ( II ) includes 13 amino acids encoded by exon B40 .
Substitution of this subregion with exon M43 in Fxh causes substantial changes in amino acid sequences resulting in only a 21 % identity in this region between F011 and F411 .
Another subregion ( IV ) is located at the C - terminal end and A030 lacks this homologous region by the inclusion of exon A53 , which results in a frame shift .
Since F411 and A030 show poor splicing activation compared with F011 and A016 , respectively , these two subregions of F011 and A016 appear to serve as activation domains , presumably by interacting with other proteins .
This notion is supported by the finding that the RRM - lacking isoform F402 , which includes the same subregions II and IV as F011 , functions apparently as a dominant - negative mutant to the wild - type Fxh , consistent with the interpretation that the mutant and wild - type are competing to interact with other protein ( s ) .
To date , Fyn tyrosine kinase and estrogen receptor - alpha have been reported to interact with Fxh , and ataxin - 2 with A2BP1 ( 23 , 41 , 42 ) .
Whether these proteins participate in the regulation of pre - mRNA splicing is currently unknown .
Of interest , A030 with the exogenous NLS activates N30 splicing as efficiently as F011 in the pre - mRNAs derived from minigenes J and H , which contain the shorter intron , whereas this isoform poorly activates N30 splicing in the pre - mRNA from minigene G , which contains the full - length intron .
This observation implies that the interactions of A030 with different factors are required in the different pre - mRNA contexts .
Therefore , the isoforms of Fxh and A2BP1 described here may have different effects on other UGCAUG - regulated alternative splicing .
The involvement of the hexanucleotide UGCAUG in regulated alternative splicing has been experimentally demonstrated in a number of neural cell - specific , as well as other tissue - specific , model systems ( 13 - 21 ) .
This hexanucleotide element plays a role , in most cases , as an enhancer in regulating alternative splicing of cassette - type exons as well as mutually exclusive exons .
Furthermore , computational analysis has revealed that UGCAUG is over - represented in the introns in which splicing is regulated , compared with the constitutively spliced introns ( 43 ) .
This analysis also pointed to the UGCAUG element as playing a role in the regulation of tissue - specific alternative splicing in a wide range of tissues , but not in specific tissues .
To date , KH - type splicing regulatory protein ( KSRP ) ( 44 ) , A2BP1 ( 21 ) and Fxh ( this study ) are known to be capable of binding to UGCAUG .
KSRP is expressed ubiquitously and tissue - specific variants of this gene have not been described so far .
In this study , we have described the existence of tissue - dependent isoforms of Fxh and A2BP1 , which , while not identical in some areas of the molecule , may contain the same RRM .
The physiological relevance of these isoforms is that they have different splicing activities and different subcellular localizations .
The brain isoforms promote N30 inclusion more efficiently than the muscle isoforms of both Fxh and A2BP1 .
The isoforms lacking the RRM are normally expressed to a significant extent in skeletal muscles .
This isoform is incapable of activating N30 splicing and , moreover , can inhibit N30 inclusion .
The properties of these isoforms are consistent with Fxh and A2BP1 acting as regulators for N30 splicing , since N30 is included in neuronal cells , but excluded in muscles .
Therefore , despite the tissue - independent occurrence of UGCAUG as a regulatory element , given the tissue - dependent isoforms of the UGCAUG - binding proteins ( Fxh and A2BP1 ) with different activities , the hexanucleotide UGCAUG could confer tissue specificity on regulated splicing .
One of the major problems in understanding the mechanisms responsible for alternative pre - mRNA splicing is the manner in which tissue specificity is determined .
In vertebrates , to date , only a few tissue - specific proteins have been identified as splicing regulators ( 8 - 12 ) .
Here , we have shown that the tissue - dependent isoforms of the sequence - specific RNA - binding proteins , which themselves are generated by alternative splicing , have different activities in tissue - specific alternative splicing of target pre - mRNA .
Therefore , these isoforms play a role in the determination of tissue specificity of target pre - mRNA splicing .
The discovery of these tissue - dependent isoforms of the UGCAUG - binding proteins with different splicing activities adds an important new dimension to the molecular mechanisms responsible for regulating tissue - dependent alternative splicing mediated via UGCAUG .
Mutations of PIK3CA in gastric adenocarcinoma
Abstract
Background
Activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) through mutational inactivation of PTEN tumour suppressor gene is common in diverse cancer types , but rarely reported in gastric cancer .
Recently , mutations in PIK3CA , which encodes the p110 alpha catalytic subunit of PI3K , have been identified in various human:__entity__ cancers , including 3 of 12 gastric cancers .
Eighty percent of these reported mutations clustered within 2 regions involving the helical and kinase domains .
In vitro study on one of the " hot - spot " mutants has demonstrated it as an activating mutation .
Methods
Based on these data , we initiated PIK3CA mutation screening in 94 human:__entity__ gastric cancers by direct sequencing of the gene regions in which 80 % of all the known PIK3CA mutations were found .
We also examined PIK3CA expression level by extracting data from the previous large - scale gene expression profiling study .
Using Significance Analysis of Microarrays ( SAM ) , we further searched for genes that show correlating expression with PIK3CA .
Results
We have identified PIK3CA mutations in 4 cases ( 4 . 3 % ) , all involving the previously reported hotspots .
Among these 4 cases , 3 tumours demonstrated microsatellite instability and 2 tumours harboured concurrent KRAS mutation .
Data extracted from microarray studies showed an increased expression of PIK3CA in gastric cancers when compared with the non - neoplastic gastric mucosae ( p < 0 . 001 ) .
SAM further identified 2910 genes whose expression levels were positively associated with that of PIK3CA .
Conclusion
Our data suggested that activation of the PI3K signalling pathway in gastric cancer may be achieved through up - regulation or mutation of PIK3CA , in which the latter may be a consequence of mismatch repair deficiency .
Background
The phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) - AKT signalling pathway is involved in the regulation of diverse cellular processes , including cell growth , survival and motility .
Abnormal activation of this pathway is frequently observed in various cancer types , leading to aberrant cell cycle progression , altered adhesion and motility , inhibition of apoptosis and induction of angiogenesis [ 1 ] .
It has been previously reported that genetic alterations involving various members along this signalling pathway could lead to its activation in cancer .
These include mutation , allelic loss or promoter methylation of the negative regulator PTEN [ 2 ] ; or alternatively , chromosomal amplification or over - expression of the positive regulators PIK3CA [ 3 - 5 ] and the various AKT kinases [ 6 , 7 ] .
Furthermore , changes in other related pathways that are commonly altered in cancer , such as those involved in growth factor stimulation via the G - protein - coupled receptors or through direct interaction with the activated form of small GTPase RAS , can also lead to PI3K - AKT pathway activation [ 8 ] .
Activation of this pathway results in the phosphorylation of AKT at Thr - 308 / 309 and Ser - 473 / 474 .
These phosphorylated forms of AKT proteins have been detected by Western blot or immunohistochemistry in various cancer types , suggesting the frequent activation of PI3K - AKT pathway in the carcinogenic process [ 7 , 9 ] .
Although genetic changes along the PI3K - AKT pathway have been repeatedly documented in brain , ovarian , endometrial , breast , prostate and thyroid cancers [ 1 , 2 ] , reports on its mechanism of activation in gastric cancer are limited .
Gastric cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide but its molecular basis of tumourigenesis is still poorly understood .
Previous immunohistochemical study has demonstrated the presence of the phosphorylated form of AKT in 78 % of gastric cancer [ 10 ] , suggesting that activation of this pathway may also be common in gastric cancer .
Though loss of heterozygosity ( LOH ) involving the PTEN locus has been demonstrated in 47 % of gastric cancer in a recent study , mutation or promoter methylation was absent even in cases with LOH [ 11 ] .
Thus data from this study could not support the two - hit inactivation of PTEN in gastric cancer , while the biological significance of PTEN haploinsufficiency remains controversial .
Alternatively , amplification of AKT1 has been reported in a single case of gastric cancer [ 12 ] , and amplification of PIK3CA associated with elevated mRNA levels has been found in 36 % of gastric cancer [ 11 ] .
More recently , Samuels et al . screened a diverse spectrum of human:__entity__ cancers for mutation in 16 PI3K or PI3K - like genes and found a high frequency of somatic mutation in PIK3CA , which encodes the p110 alpha catalytic subunit .
Major screening in colorectal cancer ( CRC ) identified PIK3CA mutations in 74 out of 234 ( 32 % ) cases , while mutations were also noted in 3 out of 12 ( 25 % ) gastric cancers .
Reported mutations were mostly of missense type , and clustered within 2 regions in the helical and kinase domains .
Expression of a " hot - spot " mutant , H1047R , conferred a significant up - regulation of lipid kinase activity of PIK3CA , suggesting it as an activating mutation [ 13 ] .
In this study , we have examined a series of 94 human:__entity__ gastric adenocarcinomas for PIK3CA mutation .
We have also examined PIK3CA expression level by extracting data from a large - scale gene expression profiling study previously performed for these cases [ 14 , 15 ] .
Using SAM , genes with significant correlating expression with PIK3CA have also been identified .
Methods
Patient:__entity__ samples preparation
DNA samples used for sequencing were prepared from frozen tumour and non - tumour gastric mucosae from 94 gastric cancer patients:__entity__ who underwent gastrectomy in the Department of Surgery , Queen Mary Hospital , The University of Hong Kong , as previously described [ 16 ] .
Majority of the frozen samples ( n = 81 ) showed tumour component of over 70 % , whereas in 13 cases a lower proportion between 50 to 70 % was accepted due to the tumours ' inherent diffuse infiltrative nature with entrapment of non - neoplastic components .
Analysis for microsatellite instability ( MSI ) , BRAF and KRAS mutation have been performed and reported previously [ 16 ] .
RNA preparation and gene expression profiling using a cDNA microarray containing 44 , 500 cDNA clones , representing around 30 , 300 unique genes , has been performed and reported in 90 of these tumours in comparison to 22 non - tumour gastric mucosae [ 14 , 15 ] .
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Hong Kong .
Mutational screening
Mutation screening of PIK3CA was performed for exons 9 and 20 , covering the mutational hotspots ; and for exon 18 , from which a mutation was found in a gastric cancer .
Mutations in these 3 exons constituted 80 % of all PIK3CA mutations detected in the previous study [ 13 ] .
PIK3CA intron - specific external amplification primers and internal sequencing primers were designed according to the previous study [ 13 ] with some modifications [ see Additional file 1 ] .
In particular , primers for exon 9 have been modified to avoid amplification of homologous sequences located in other chromosomes .
PCR products were generated using the external primers and directly sequenced using the internal primers with the DYEnamic (TM) ET Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit ( Amersham Biosciences , Freiburg , Germany ) according to the manufacturer ' s instruction .
Electrophoresis was performed in the ABI Prism (R) 3700 DNA Analyzer ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA , USA ) .
For each exon , PCR products were generated from 2 independent PCR reactions for sequencing of the forward and reverse strands .
For exon 9 , 2 independent PCR followed by sequencing of the forward strand were performed .
Analysis of the chromatograms was performed using the mutation analysis software Mutation Explorer (TM) ( SoftGenetics , State College , PA , USA ) .
Extraction of expression data and statistical analysis
Gene expression data were extracted from the microarray database containing 126 samples ( 90 gastric cancers , 14 lymph node metastasis and 22 non - tumour gastric mucosae ) based on a 3 - fold signal above background ratio for either channel and with 80 % good data [ 14 ] .
Gene expression data from 20 , 336 cDNA clones satisfied this selection criteria and were extracted , which included a cDNA clone corresponding to PIK3CA ( IMAGE clone number 345430 , GenBank accession no . W72473 ) .
Expression data for PIK3CA was extracted and the differences in expression levels between tumour and non - tumour tissues were examined using the Student ' s t - Test .
SAM was performed to identify genes with significant correlating expression with PIK3CA [ 17 ] .
The missing values in the dataset were estimated by a K - nearest neighbours impute algorithm using 10 nearest neighbour [ 18 ] followed by 5000 permutations in the SAM analysis .
Results
Among the 94 gastric adenocarcinoma analysed , we have detected PIK3CA mutation in 4 cases .
Two cases harboured the mutation A3140G ( H1047R ) in exon 20 , and the other 2 cases with mutations G1624A ( E542K ) and G1633A ( E545K ) in exon 9 .
Representative sequence chromatograms are shown in figure 1 .
All four mutations were absent in the corresponding non - neoplastic mucosae and thus were confirmed as somatic mutations .
Though the overall mutation frequency ( 4 . 3 % ) was lower than that of the previous study , the nature of the 4 mutations found were consistent with those identified at the reported hotspots .
In particular , the H1047R mutation has been reported in 2 gastric cancers and 15 colorectal cancers [ 13 ] .
While the E542K and the E545K mutations were not found in gastric cancer in the previous series , a large number of colorectal tumours did harbour these 2 mutations .
PIK3CA mutation spectrum and their corresponding clinico - pathological features were listed in Table 1 .
We noted a higher tendency of high - level MSI in gastric cancers with PIK3CA mutations ( 3 in 4 , 75 % ) than in those without ( 18 in 90 , 20 % ) .
Moreover , though the overall incidence of KRAS mutation in the studied population was low ( 8 in 94 ) , 2 of the 4 gastric cancers with PIK3CA mutation also harboured a KRAS mutation .
Since over - expression of PIK3CA has been reported in gastric cancer [ 11 ] , we have also extracted PIK3CA expression data from our previous cDNA microarray study of these cases [ 14 , 15 ] .
We have confirmed that expression level of PIK3CA was significantly higher in gastric cancers ( n = 87 , mean = 0 . 099 , SD = 0 . 428 ) when compared with non - neoplastic gastric mucosae ( n = 22 , mean = - 0 . 418 , SD = 0 . 426 ; Student ' s t - Test , p < 0 . 001 ) .
Using PIK3CA expression level as a continuous variable for SAM analysis [ 17 ] , we found 2910 cDNA clones ( corresponding to about 2546 unique genes ) whose expression associated positively with PIK3CA expression ( median number of false significant = 0 . 372 , Delta = 1 . 107 ) [ see Additional file 2 ] .
Interestingly , no gene was found to be negatively associated with PIK3CA expression .
Discussion
In this study , we have reported the presence of PIK3CA gene mutation in 4 . 3 % of gastric cancer .
A high tendency ( 3 in 4 ) of mismatch repair deficiency was noted in cases harbouring PIK3CA mutation .
Though the small number of PIK3CA mutations in our study may not justify statistical claim of significance ; suggestion of such , despite of its not being mentioned by the authors , can be found from a previous study in CRC by Samuels et al . .
From their study of 33 MSI and 201 microsatellite stable ( MSS ) CRC cases , PIK3CA mutation was present in 48 % of the MSI tumours , but only in 29 % of the MSS tumours .
A significant association would have been revealed if statistical analysis had been applied ( Fisher ' s exact test , p = 0 . 014 ) [ 13 ] .
Gastrointestinal tract cancers with MSI are known to have a different molecular pathway of tumour evolution compared with their MSS counterparts [ 19 , 20 ] .
This can be attributed to their propensity for frameshift mutations in repeat sequences , resulting in selective disruption of genes with such sequences within their coding regions .
With 2 poly - adenine tracts within its coding region , PTEN can be inactivated through frameshift mutations in MSI CRC , resulting in the selective targeting of the PI3K - AKT signalling pathway [ 21 , 22 ] .
It is also known that mismatch repair deficiency would lead to an elevated rate of missense mutation due to impaired single nucleotide mismatch repair [ 23 ] .
Thus , the observed higher incidence of PIK3CA missense mutation in MSI colorectal and gastric cancers suggests yet another mechanism for the activation of the PI3K - AKT signalling pathway through mismatch repair deficiency .
Our data also showed a higher tendency of KRAS mutation in cases with PIK3CA mutations ( 2 in 4 ) than in those without ( 6 in 90 ) .
Yet again due to the low incidence of both mutations in our samples , statistical significance may not be claimed .
In the study by Samuels et al . , some of the colorectal tumours with PIK3CA mutation also harboured KRAS or BRAF mutation [ 13 ] .
The PI3K - AKT pathway is known to have a close association with the RAS - MEKK signalling pathway [ 8 ] .
Constitutively active RAS can interact with the catalytic subunit of PI3K and lead to its activation .
Ras - dependent PI3K activation contributes to the transforming phenotype by mediating anchorage - independent growth , cytoskeletal reorganisation and apoptosis evasion .
It has been observed that genes involved in the same signalling pathway may manifest mutations in cancer cells in a mutually exclusive manner , presumably due to the lack of selective growth advantage in having a second hit in the already altered pathway .
A prominent example is the mutually exclusive occurrence of the BRAF hotspot mutation ( V600E ) and KRAS mutations in colorectal cancer [ 24 , 25 ] .
However , there exist other examples of alterations in multiple components of the same signalling pathway that may lead to a multi - level modulation of its activity .
For example , non - V600E BRAF mutations tend to occur together with KRAS mutations [ 26 ] , and inactivation of the secreted frizzled - related proteins ( antagonists of WNT ) by promoter methylation frequently coincides with mutations in the Adenomatous Polyposis Coli gene to achieve multi - level activation of the WNT signalling pathway in colorectal cancers [ 27 ] .
Whether PIK3CA functions independently from RAS , or acts synergistically with RAS to produce additive effects on the activation of the same pathway awaits further clarification .
By extracting data from microarray , we have confirmed the up - regulation of PIK3CA expression in gastric cancer tissues compared with the non - neoplastic gastric mucosae and identified a large number of genes that showed a significant positive correlation in expression level with PIK3CA .
These genes participate in diverse cellular processes with 177 as putative cell cycle - regulated genes [ 28 ] and 126 mapped to genes with known functions in cell cycle regulation , cell proliferation or DNA replication [ see Additional file 2 ] .
While some of these genes maybe induced by PIK3CA , others maybe co - ordinately regulated by common upstream signals .
Expression data set at one point was limited in differentiating the above cause and consequence , yet it certainly revealed the complexity of the carcinogenic process and the intricate relationship of PIK3CA signalling with other cellular processes .
Contrary to our expectation , the incidence of PIK3CA mutation found in the current study ( 4 % ) is much lower compared with that observed by Samuel et al .
( 25 % ) [ 13 ] .
The reason for discrepancy may simply be a result of sample bias as the previous study involved only a small number of gastric cancers ( n = 12 ) .
However , ethnic differences can also be another possibility .
The diverse pathological spectrum and aetiological factors of gastric cancers in different geographical locations may be paralleled by differences in molecular pathway of tumour development .
Since our current study is only based on a Chinese population with an intermediate gastric cancer incidence , further studies involving patients:__entity__ from different ethnic groups will be able to address this possibility .
Conclusion
Large - scale screening of gastric adenocarcinomas for PIK3CA mutations revealed a mutation incidence of 4 . 3 % .
Increased PIK3CA expression level was observed in gastric tumours compared with non - neoplastic mucosae .
This increase in PIK3CA level was associated with the elevated expression of a large number of genes , which may constitute the upstream regulators or downstream targets of PIK3CA along the PI3K signalling pathway .

Identification of kinectin as a novel Beh c et ' s disease autoantigen
Abstract
There has been some evidence that Beh c et ' s disease ( BD ) has a significant autoimmune component but the molecular identity of putative autoantigens has not been well characterized .
In the initial analysis of the autoantibody profile in 39 Chinese BD patients:__entity__ , autoantibodies to cellular proteins were uncovered in 23 % as determined by immunoblotting .
We have now identified one of the major autoantibody specificities using expression cloning .
Serum from a BD patient:__entity__ was used as a probe to immunoscreen a lambda ZAP expression cDNA library .
Candidate autoantigen cDNAs were characterized by direct nucleotide sequencing and their expressed products were examined for reactivity to the entire panel of BD sera using immunoprecipitation .
Reactivity was also examined with normal control sera and disease control sera from patients:__entity__ with lupus and Sj o gren ' s syndrome .
Six independent candidate clones were isolated from the cDNA library screen and were identified as overlapping partial human:__entity__ kinectin cDNAs .
The finding that kinectin was an autoantigen was verified in 9 out of 39 ( 23 % ) BD patient:__entity__ sera by immunoprecipitation of the in vitro translation products .
Sera from controls showed no reactivity .
The significance of kinectin as a participant in autoimmune pathogenesis in BD and the potential use of autoantibody to kinectin in serodiagnostics are discussed .
Introduction
Beh c et ' s disease ( BD ) is a systemic vasculitic disease typified by a triad of symptoms including recurrent oral ulcers , genital ulcers and uveitis .
In addition , skin , joint , large vessels , nervous system and gastrointestinal systems may be involved .
BD is a global disease but has the highest prevalence in the region along the ancient ' Silk Road ' in China .
The etiopathogenesis of the disease remains unclear but microbial agent triggers , environmental factors , genetic predisposition , neutrophil hyperfunction , endothelial cell dysfunction and immunological abnormalities involving both T and B cells have been implicated .
Increasing amounts of research evidence supports the possibility that it is an immune - mediated vasculitis , and that abnormal T - cell and B - cell reactions and autoantigen - driven autoimmunity play pivotal roles [ 1 ] .
Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) is the prototypic systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease with autoantibodies against cellular ( particularly nuclear ) antigens , some of which are critically implicated in the autoimmune pathology while others provide valuable serodiagnostic markers for the disease .
Unlike the picture in SLE and other related rheumatic diseases , in BD , antinuclear antibodies and antibodies to neutrophil cytoplasmic antigens etc . are not present .
To date , since neither a specific autoantibody nor pathognomonic pathological index is available to help establish the diagnosis of BD , it is largely or solely based on clinical manifestations [ 2 ] , and a dilemma in diagnosis is not a rare occurrence in clinical practice .
Nevertheless , since the 1960s , there have been reports of autoantibodies against certain unknown components of human:__entity__ oral mucosa in sera of patients:__entity__ with BD .
Since then , sporadic reports on findings of autoantibodies in this disease have been described , such as antibodies to retinal antigen ( s ) , heat shock protein ( HSP ) of some strains of Streptococcus:__entity__ sanguis:__entity__ cross - reactive with human:__entity__ HSP polypeptide [ 3 ] , antibodies to endothelial cell antigens ( AECA ) and antibodies to alpha - tropomyosin [ 4 , 5 ] , attesting to the complicated humoral immune disorders in this disease .
This investigation was aimed at defining target cellular autoantigens using time - tested and well - established molecular techniques .
Immunoscreening of expression libraries using BD sera was used since this approach has been successfully employed in the characterization of many clinically relevant antigens in systemic rheumatic diseases such as SS - A / Ro [ 6 - 9 ] and SS - B / La [ 10 ] antigens in Sj o gren ' s syndrome ( SjS ) and centromere antigen CENP - B [ 11 ] in scleroderma .
In addition , we have been successful in using this strategy to identify interesting autoantigens that have other biological significance .
Examples of these include NOR90 / hUBF [ 12 ] , p80 - coilin [ 13 ] , Golgi autoantigens [ 14 - 16 ] and , more recently , GW182 [ 17 ] .
Materials and methods
Patients:__entity__ and sera
The currently used empirical criteria for the diagnosis of BD in this study were the criteria proposed by the International Study Group for BD ( abbreviated as ' International Criteria ' ) [ 2 ] .
The study subjects of 39 Chinese BD patients:__entity__ comprised 17 males and 22 females , mean age 37 +/- 11 . 3 years old , who were divided into two subgroups : 25 typical BD patients:__entity__ ( Group I , satisfying the International Criteria ) and 14 clinically diagnosed BD patients:__entity__ who had recurrent oral ulcers and one of the symptoms of genital ulcers , eye symptoms or skin lesions as defined by the International Criteria , as well as additional symptom ( s ) closely related to BD as listed in the International Criteria , that is , gastrointestinal ulcerations , deep vein thrombosis or arthralgia / arthritis without evidence that the latter symptoms might be related to any other disease ( Group II , defined as ' probable BD ' in this study ) .
Disease controls included 10 patients:__entity__ with SLE and 10 with SjS , all satisfying corresponding international classification criteria .
All BD patients:__entity__ and disease controls involved in the study were patients:__entity__ treated at the Rheumatology Department of Ren Ji Hospital , Shanghai , China , where their clinical data and serum samples were collected .
Twenty normal control sera were randomly selected from healthy blood donors working in the same hospital .
This study was approved by the institution review board of Ren Ji Hospital which is affiliated with Shanghai Second Medical University , and each patient:__entity__ involved gave informed consent .
All serum samples were preserved at - 20 degrees C or - 70 degrees C until use .
Cell lines and cell extracts
HeLa ( ATCC CCL 2 . 2 ) and T24 ( human:__entity__ transitional cell bladder carcinoma ) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( Rockville , MD , USA ) .
A bovine:__entity__ aortic endothelial cell line was kindly provided by Dr Eugene G Levin from the Scripps Research Institute ( La Jolla , CA , USA ) .
Cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10 % calf:__entity__ serum , harvested and extracted in Buffer A ( 150 mM NaCl , 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH7 . 2 , 0 . 5 % Nonidet P - 40 ) with protease inhibitor ( Complete (TM) ; Boehringer Mannheim , Indianapolis , IN , USA ) .
For the preparation of whole cell extract , 10 volumes of Laemmli gel sample buffer [ 18 ] were added to the cell pellet , boiled for 3 min and stored at - 20 degrees C until use .
Western blot
Whole cell lysates from bovine:__entity__ aortic endothelial cell , HeLa and T24 cells were resolved individually by discontinuous 7 . 5 % gel SDS - PAGE according to Laemmli ' s method [ 18 ] .
Immunoblotting was performed as described by Towbin et al .
[ 19 ] with modifications .
Nitrocellulose strips were blocked with 3 % nonfat milk in PBS containing 0 . 05 % Tween - 20 ( PBS - T ) and then incubated with BD patient:__entity__ sera and normal control sera ( 1 : 100 dilution ) at room temperature for 1 h .
Filters were washed extensively with PBS - T to remove any unbound antibodies .
Bound antibodies were detected with polyvalent , peroxidase - conjugated goat:__entity__ anti - human:__entity__ Ig and visualized by incubating the nitrocellulose strips in chemiluminescent reagents ( NEN Life Science Products Inc . , Boston , MA , USA ) and exposing to Kodak XAR - 5 films .
Screening of phage cDNA expression library with antibody probes
Serum from a BD patient:__entity__ showing the highest antibody titer in immunoblotting was selected as a probe and used at a dilution of 1 : 300 for initial immunoscreening of approximately 106 recombinants from a T24 cDNA expression library .
The latter was constructed in lambda ZAPExpress vector ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA , USA ) and screened as previously described [ 20 - 22 ] .
All screenings were performed on duplicate isopropyl beta - D - thiogalactoside ( IPTG ) pre - impregnated nitrocellulose filters , and immunoreactive clones were detected by chemiluminescence .
Positive phages were subsequently plaque purified to 100 % by two repeated rounds of screening at low plaque densities .
Before screening the cDNA library , the BD serum was extensively adsorbed against bacteria and wild - type lambda ZAP phage mixture to reduce background binding .
Analysis of candidate cDNAs
Purified candidate plaques were subcloned in vivo into pBK - CMV plasmids using ExAssist (TM) helper phage as recommended in the manufacturer ' s instructions ( Stratagene ) .
The recombinant pBK - CMV plasmids were then purified using QIAprep Spin Minprep Kit ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA , USA ) .
Restriction enzyme digestion of plasmids with EcoRI and XhoI and electrophoresis in a standard 1 . 0 % agarose gel was used to analyze the length of cDNA insert of each candidate plasmid .
The complete nucleotide sequence was determined using Bigdye terminator sequencing and a semi - automated sequencer model 377 ( ABI , Foster City , CA , USA ) .
Both nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences were analyzed for similarity with known sequences using BLAST search [ 23 ] and ExPASy Proteomics tools .
Secondary structure analysis for coiled - coil motifs was conducted with the software program COILS [ 24 ] .
Immunoprecipitation of in vitro translation products
Candidate cDNA clones were used as templates for in vitro transcription and translation and the products were used as substrates for immunoprecipitation to confirm the specificity of reaction with BD sera .
In brief , 1 mu g of the pBK - CMV plasmid identified in the screening outlined above was added as template in a 50 - mu l reaction for the coupled in vitro transcription and translation reaction with a rabbit:__entity__ reticulocyte lysate system ( Promega , Madison , WI , USA ) in the presence of 35S - methionine ( Trans - 35S label ; ICN Biochemicals , Costa Mesa , CA , USA ) and RNasin (R) Ribonuclease Inhibitor ( Stratagene ) as recommended by the manufacturer ( Promega ) .
Translation was carried out at 30 degrees C for 1 . 5 h .
Products were analyzed in a 12 . 5 % gel SDS - PAGE and stored at - 80 degrees C for further immunoprecipitation analysis .
The in vitro translation proteins were examined for reactivity by sera using immunoprecipitation described [ 8 , 25 ] .
Results and discussion
Autoantibody detection in sera from BD patients:__entity__
Initial examination of a group of 39 BD patients:__entity__ using indirect immunofluorescence ( IIF ) on a HEp - 2 cell substrate did not yield any characteristic nuclear or cytoplasmic staining patterns .
BD is thought by some to be a vasculitic disease involving pathophysiology of endothelial cells , and antibody to endothelial cell antigen ( AECA ) has been reported .
Reports on the prevalence of AECA have varied largely and alpha - enolase was reported as one of the putative target antigens [ 26 ] .
In this study , the use of bovine:__entity__ aortic endothelial cells as substrate for IIF did not provide any additional data .
However , Western blot analysis of the BD sera began to show some interesting autoreactivity using cell lysates from both HeLa and bovine:__entity__ aortic endothelial cells .
HeLa cells were initially used for this analysis because they are commonly used in the laboratory as Western blot substrate .
Fig .
1 illustrates the common reactivity to 49 kDa and 120 kDa proteins in the endothelial cell lysates .
These antigens were also detected in HeLa and T24 cells ; the latter cell line was analyzed because our laboratory at The Scripps Research Institute has produced an excellent expression cDNA library from the T24 line and the positive result with the T24 cell extracts allowed us to screen the T24 library .
Ig isotype analysis showed that all reactivity was largely IgG antibodies .
Since the 49 kDa and 120 kDa bands were observed in cell extracts from bovine:__entity__ as well as human:__entity__ cell lines , these autoantigens might be evolutionarily conserved .
In total , nine out of 39 BD sera ( 23 % ) had autoantibody to the 49 kDa antigen and eight ( 20 % ) to the 120 kDa antigen .
Four BD sera ( 10 % ) reacted with both proteins .
Additionally , sera that showed common reactivity to the 120 kDa protein also demonstrated a common band that migrated at ~ 150 kDa , although it appeared weaker than the 120 kDa band .
These antigens appeared to have different molecular weights than those of the known autoantigens in systemic rheumatic diseases .
In addition , other reactive bands were detected but they were not as commonly shared as the 49 kDa and 120 kDa bands .
The 49 kDa protein was shown to be distinct from 48 kDa SS - B / La or 50 kDa Jo - 1 proteins ( Fig . 1 ) .
The 120 kDa antigen was also shown to migrate differently from alanyl tRNA synthetase in another Western blot analysis ( data not shown ) and did not share any apparent crossreactive epitopes with the 49 kDa antigen .
Western blot analyses of 20 normal control sera did not show the reactivities observed with BD sera .
In order to further characterize these autoreactivities , a serum sample from the Group I definitive BD patients:__entity__ with the strongest reactivity to 49 kDa and 120 kDa antigens ( Fig . 1 , lane 2 ) was selected as antibody probe for expression library screening .
Kinectin identified as a novel BD autoantigen
After screening 500 , 000 clones from the T24 cell lambda ZAPExpress expression library , seven immunoreactive clones were isolated and plaque purified in two to three rounds to achieve 100 % homogeneity .
The cDNA inserts were subcloned in vivo into pBK - CMV plasmids , analyzed by restriction digestion using EcoRI and XhoI enzymes , and submitted to direct nucleotide sequencing across the polylinker arms .
The cDNA inserts represented six independent clones designated BD41 ( identical to BD44 ) , BD481 , BD42 , BD47 , BD482 and BD49 .
Their identities were established as overlapping partial cDNAs of human:__entity__ kinectin , ranging from 1 . 9 kb to 3 kb ( Fig . 2a ) .
The full - length human:__entity__ kinectin ( GenBank accession number NM _ 182926 [ 27 ] ) has 4 , 816 bases containing an open reading frame coding 1 , 357 amino acid residues with molecular mass 156 kDa .
All six cDNAs lacked the 5 ' portion of the kinectin sequence to different degrees but spanned a sequence of kinectin that extended to the 3 ' - untranslated region .
Secondary structure analysis of kinectin protein using the program COILS identified a long region of alpha - helical coiled - coil domain that extended from amino acid residue 327 to the C - terminus ( Fig . 2a , hatched boxes ) .
In vitro coupled transcription and translation of BD44 and BD42 clones directed the synthesis of [ 35S ] - methionine - labeled polypeptides that migrated at 95 and 60 kDa , respectively , in addition to smaller polypeptides ( Fig . 2b ) .
These products had predicted molecular weights of 103 kDa and 75 kDa .
Kinectin was initially identified in chick:__entity__ embryo brain microsome as an integral membrane protein anchored in endoplasmic reticulum and involved in kinesin - driven vesicle motility along microtubules [ 28 , 29 ] .
Kinectin consists of a 120 - kDa and a 160 - kDa polypeptide interacting through the alpha - helical coiled - coil domain to form a heterodimer [ 30 ] .
The full - length kinectin is the 160 kDa polypeptide containing an N - terminal transmembrane helix followed by a bipartite nuclear localization sequence and two C - terminal leucine zipper motifs .
We presume that the 120 kDa polypeptide detected in Western blot ( Fig . 1 ) is the truncated version of the 160 - kDa polypeptide , lacking the N - terminal first 232 amino acids [ 30 ] .
The N - terminus of the 160 - kDa polypeptide consists of a transmembrane domain that anchors kinectin to endoplasmic reticulum [ 30 , 31 ] .
This 120 kDa polypeptide is probably the predominant form detected in the Western blot analysis ( Fig . 1 ) because of its preferential solubility due to the omission of the N - terminal transmembrane domain .
Other functions for kinectin have been reported .
Yeast:__entity__ two - hybrid screen studies from several laboratories have revealed the interaction of the Rho family of GTPase with kinectin , and have shown the functional links among RhoG , kinectin and kinesin , with kinectin as a key effector of RhoG microtubule - dependent cellular activity [ 32 ] .
Kinectin was also identified as an important constituent of integrin - based adhesion complexes , which link integrins to the cytoskeleton and recruit signaling molecules [ 33 ] .
A new study reported that a kinectin isoform lacking a major portion of the kinesin - binding domain is very probably the most conservative form of kinectin ; it does not bind kinesin but act as a membrane anchor for the translation elongation factor - 1 delta in the endoplasmic reticulum [ 34 ] .
Prevalence and specificity of anti - kinectin autoantibodies
The in vitro [ 35S ] - methionine - labeled translation product of BD44 , representing the largest recombinant kinectin fragment available , was used as the antigen substrate in an immunoprecipitation assay .
Out of 39 BD patient:__entity__ sera , nine ( 23 % ) recognized the BD44 translation product ( Fig . 3 ) , whereas sera from 20 normal controls , 10 SLE and 10 SjS patients:__entity__ did not show reactivity .
Among the nine anti - kinectin positive patients:__entity__ , six ( 6 / 25 , 24 % ) were from Group I ( definitive BD ) including the BD patient:__entity__ whose serum was used in the immunoscreening of expression cDNA library , and three ( 3 / 14 , 21 . 4 % ) patients:__entity__ were from the Group II ( probable BD ) in this study .
According to the Fisher Exact Probability calculation ( P = 1 . 00 ) , there is no statistically significant difference for antibody to kinectin between the two groups .
The combined data substantiated the finding that kinectin is an autoantigen that can be recognized by sera from 23 % of Chinese BD patients:__entity__ in this study with at least one immunoreactive region or autoepitope residing within the BD44 encoded polypeptide .
Currently , there are more than six diagnostic / classification criteria for BD , among which the International Criteria have been applied most extensively due to its relatively high sensitivity ( 91 % ) and specificity ( 96 % ) [ 2 ] .
As discussed above , differential diagnosis of BD might be confusing in clinical practice since no specific laboratory test is available , and some patients:__entity__ may have symptoms and signs strongly suggestive of BD but do not fully satisfy the International Criteria , as in the Group II ( probable BD ) patients:__entity__ in our study group .
A number of investigators have pointed out that a comprehensive analysis of the clinical data for a given patient:__entity__ is very important for correct clinical diagnosis of BD , and that classification / diagnosis criteria , including the International Criteria , should be followed but should not be exclusive .
The observation that three out of 14 patients:__entity__ in the probable BD group also had antibody to kinectin and the similar percentage of positive reactors between this group and Group I ( 21 . 4 % versus 24 % ) supports this notion .
The further use of non - clinical parameters such as immunological biomarkers as adjuncts to identify BD patients:__entity__ could be of help in the classification of this disease entity
While our work was ongoing , anti - kinectin antibodies were reported in sera from patients:__entity__ with hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) [ 35 , 36 ] and aplastic anemia [ 37 , 38 ] .
The first HCC report [ 35 ] identified kinectin as a tumor - associated antigen from the screening of an autologous cDNA library constructed from the cancer of a 30 - year - old patient:__entity__ from Guangxi , China .
This report stated that four out of five HCC patients:__entity__ tested were positive for anti - kinectin antibody [ 35 ] .
In 2004 , another laboratory also reported the cloning of kinectin as a tumor - associated antigen from a ( presumably ) different 30 - year - old Chinese HCC patient:__entity__ [ 36 ] .
In contrast , anti - kinectin antibodies were not detected in other studies of HCC patients:__entity__ associated with our laboratory [ 39 , 40 ] .
The reports of anti - kinectin antibodies in aplastic anemia are also very interesting [ 37 , 38 ] .
The initial report by Hirano et al . identified kinectin by screening an aplastic anemia patient:__entity__ for candidate antigens using a Clontech human:__entity__ fetal liver cDNA expression library and it was concluded that seven out of 18 aplastic anemia patients:__entity__ were positive for anti - kinectin while none of the normal or disease controls had this antibody [ 37 ] .
In their recent report , Hirano et al . reported that anti - kinectin antibodies were found in 39 % of aplastic anemia patients:__entity__ from the United States but only in three out of 30 ( 10 % ) cases in Japan [ 38 ] .
In our study reported here , kinectin antibodies were only detected in BD patients:__entity__ and not in normal controls and SLE and SjS disease controls .
None of the BD patients:__entity__ with anti - kinectin had signs of HCC or aplastic anemia at the time of diagnosis and at up to 4 years of follow - up .
Mapping of epitope ( s ) recognized by anti - kinectin antibodies may shed light on the question of whether different autoepitopes reside within the kinectin molecule recognized by sera from different diseases .
Kinectin - a new member of coiled - coil cytoplasmic autoantigens
We have recently reviewed the literature on the growing number of cytoplasmic autoantigens rich in alpha - helical coiled - coil domains as typified from our study of Golgi autoantigens [ 41 ] .
Golgi autoantigens are generally high molecular weight proteins between 100 and 350 kDa and rich in coiled - coil domains in the central region with non - coiled - coil or globular domains at both N and C termini .
Golgi autoantigens are displayed on the cytoplasmic face of the Golgi complex and are not localized to apoptotic blebs during apoptosis [ 42 ] .
Giantin , the highest molecular weight Golgi autoantigen reported , is the predominant target of human:__entity__ anti - Golgi complex antibodies and multiple non - cross - reactive epitopes have been mapped spanning the 350 kDa protein [ 43 ] .
Other high molecular weight autoantigens with similar features have been reported in cytoplasmic and mitotic organelles suggesting that these selected proteins become autoimmunogenic based on their subcellular association and molecular features [ 41 ] .
For example , in the endosomal compartment , the two known autoantigens are early endosomal protein EEA1 ( 180 kDa ) [ 44 ] and CLIP - 170 ( 170 kDa ) [ 45 ] .
There is also a series of centrosomal autoantigens identified as coiled - coil - rich proteins including pericentrin , a 220 kDa protein [ 46 ] , ninein , a protein with alternatively spliced products of 245 and 249 kDa [ 47 ] , Cep250 ( 250 kDa ) and Cep110 ( 110 kDa ) [ 48 ] .
Centromere autoantigens have been described but the two interesting ones related to this discussion are CENP - E [ 49 ] and CENP - F [ 50 ] ; both are high molecular weight proteins ( 312 to 400 kDa ) and have the same type of overall structure as discussed above .
NuMA is another large coiled - coil protein located at the mitotic spindle pole and is the most common target autoantigen in sera with mitotic spindle apparatus staining [ 51 ] .
Non - muscle myosin ( ~ 200 kDa ) is a cytoskeletal autoantigen [ 52 ] that falls in the same group of high molecular weight and coiled - coil - rich autoantigens .
These endosomal , centrosomal , mitotic apparatus and intracellular autoantigens are , like the golgins , proteins with high molecular weights and an overall high content of coiled - coil domains .
The combination of these two physical features in autoantigens may contribute to the induction and production of autoimmune antibodies in certain disease states .
Kinectin is an integral membrane protein largely confined to the endoplasmic reticulum [ 28 , 31 ] and it fits into this new category of autoantigens that are large coiled - coil rich proteins ( >= 100 kDa ) in the cytoplasm .
Conclusion
Here we report the detection of kinectin autoantibody in 23 % of Chinese patients:__entity__ with BD .
The identity of kinectin as a BD - related autoantigen has not been reported to date .
Autoantibody reaction against kinectin in BD observed in this study further confirms the autoimmune involvement in BD and may provide new inroads into elucidating the immunopathogenesis of the disease .
In an effort to clarify the association of BD with antibody to kinectin , it is essential to measure antibody to kinectin in larger patient:__entity__ populations including both BD , probable BD and important autoimmune rheumatic diseases such as SLE , SjS , rheumatoid arthritis etc . , as well as those diseases not easily differentiated from BD , such as recurrent aphthous oral ulcer , Reiter ' s syndrome , inflammatory bowel diseases etc .
On the other hand , further analysis of the association of anti - kinectin antibody with different manifestations or disease ' subtypes ' of BD is another important project .
Anti - kinectin is clearly only one of the antigen - antibody systems identified because there were many other antibodies observed in the Western blot analysis of BD sera .
Using other sera for immunoscreening would probably lead to the identification of other potentially important antigen - antibody systems .

EndoNet : an information resource about endocrine networks
Abstract
EndoNet is a new database that provides information about the components of endocrine networks and their relations .
It focuses on the endocrine cell - to - cell communication and enables the analysis of intercellular regulatory pathways in humans:__entity__ .
In the EndoNet data model , two classes of components span a bipartite directed graph .
One class represents the hormones ( in the broadest sense ) secreted by defined donor cells .
The other class consists of the acceptor or target cells expressing the corresponding hormone receptors .
The identity and anatomical environment of cell types , tissues and organs is defined through references to the CYTOMER (R) ontology .
With the EndoNet user interface , it is possible to query the database for hormones , receptors or tissues and to combine several items from different search rounds in one complex result set , from which a network can be reconstructed and visualized .
For each entity , a detailed characteristics page is available .
Some well - established endocrine pathways are offered as showcases in the form of predefined result sets .
These sets can be used as a starting point for a more complex query or for obtaining a quick overview .
The EndoNet database is accessible at .
INTRODUCTION
Theoretical analyses in the post - sequencing era , in particular in the context of systems biology approaches , increasingly investigate the properties of all kinds of pathways and networks such as metabolic and signaling pathways .
It is commonly accepted that we need formal descriptions of these networks to make systematic use of the overwhelming body of facts gathered over decades of laboratory work both in narrow or global scale .
Corresponding databases have been created and are available now for metabolic networks ( KEGG ) ( 1 , 2 ) , protein interaction networks ( BIND and DIP ) ( 3 , 4 ) and signaling pathways ( CSNDB , Patika and TRANSPATH (R) ) ( 5 - 8 ) , just to name a few .
So far , however , their main focus is on intracellular processes .
Intercellular signaling is addressed only insofar as usually the pathways modeled start with extracellular ligands , and as there exist catalogs and databases about secreted proteins , or the ' secretome ' , of certain systems ( 9 - 12 ) .
This shortcoming is part of the more comprehensive problem , the genotype - phenotype gap : from a certain genotype , we are able to infer a ' molecular phenotype ' , but for correlating it with a more complex phenotype such as a biological process , or even a certain disease and its clinical appearance , we still depend largely on the mere description of an observed correlation .
There is no way to infer such a phenotype through all the different layers of increasing complexity between genomic DNA sequences and the physiological function of whole organs and their interplay within an organism .
There may be principal barriers preventing such an inference across different complexity levels , but even to explore these limits , we have to make attempts to bridge the genotype - phenotype gap .
We have to do the next step towards modeling intercellular networks that are inextricably linked to the physiology of multicellular organisms ( 13 ) .
Being one of the most complex constructs in the body , the endocrine system comprises numerous cells and tissues that secrete hormones which pass through the body , activate specific receptors of target cells and initiate there multiple intracellular signaling pathways .
Here , we present a new database , EndoNet , which provides information about the components of endocrine networks and their relations , and enables the analysis of intercellular regulatory pathways in humans:__entity__ .
The EndoNet database is accessible at .
RESULTS
The biological schema of endocrine actions
Development and function of different organs as well as the response of a whole multicellular organism to its environment is coordinated through a complex communication system between specialized cells that are part of its organs .
This communication is mostly mediated by hormones .
In a broader sense , this functional class of biomolecules also comprises growth factors , cytokines , chemokines and other signal transmitters .
This generic view is supported , for instance , by the definition given for ' hormone activity ' by Gene Ontology ( GO ) ( 14 ) : ' Any substance formed in very small amounts in one specialized organ or group of cells and carried ( sometimes in the bloodstream ) to another organ or group of cells , in the same organism , upon which it has a specific regulatory action ' .
This definition is also broad enough to include modes of hormonal actions as diverse as endocrine , paracrine and autocrine effects .
Accordingly , with the term ' hormone ' one might refer to any extracellular substance that induces specific responses in target cell and helps to coordinate growth , differentiation , gene expression and metabolic activities of various cells , tissues and organs in multicellular organisms ( 15 ) .
Hormones can be classified based on their chemical nature , solubility , the distance over which the signal acts and so on ( 15 , 16 ) .
From the viewpoint of genome - phenotype relations , it is reasonable to distinguish between polypeptide , thus , genome - encoded hormones , on one hand , and those low - molecular weight hormones such as steroids , with only the machinery of their synthesis being genome - encoded , on the other hand .
Another classification of hormones , which seems to be overlapping with the previous one refers to the intracellular location of their receptors and , thus , how the subsequent signal is further transduced : membrane - bound receptors usually trigger more or less complex signaling cascades towards the nucleus , whereas nuclear receptors , mainly bound by low - molecular weight hormones , have a very short signaling pathway downstream since they act as transcription factors themselves ( 15 , 16 ) .
In intercellular communication , we can basically differentiate between two kinds of cells : donor cells which synthesize and secrete a hormone , and acceptor cells which express a hormone receptor ( Figure 1a ) .
Donor cells become active under the influence of an external , mostly environmental , stimulus .
In the acceptor cell , binding of the hormone to a receptor triggers an intracellular signal transduction cascade with different kinds of end nodes and effects : transcription factors affecting the gene expression program of the acceptor cell , metabolic enzymes controlling the cell ' s metabolism , structural components which define the acceptor ' s morphological features , or components of the secretory apparatus regulating the release of other extracellular molecules .
If synthesis and secretion of another hormone is among the effects exerted by receptor activation , the acceptor is turned into a donor cell , thus becoming an internal node of the organism ' s endocrine network .
Acceptor cells which do not become producers of another hormone are called ' terminal target cells ' of the endocrine network , but finally constitute the overall physiological effect of the respective hormonal pathway , or simply the phenotype ( Figure 1a ) .
The EndoNet data model
In the EndoNet data model , two classes of entities -- hormones ( in the broadest sense ) and their acceptor or target cells expressing the corresponding receptors -- span a bipartite directed graph .
Since one and the same hormone may be secreted by multiple cell types ( donor cells ) , each such secretion event is represented by a hormone node on its own .
Similarly , each cell type known to express a hormone receptor ( acceptor cell ) leads to an individual node .
The graph ' s edges represent hormone transport and binding to a receptor ( intercellular edges ) , on one hand , and triggering or inhibition of hormone secretion by a receptor activated by hormone binding ( intracellular edges ) , on the other hand .
Optionally , an edge representing the transport of a hormone can be subdivided by introducing the transport medium ( usually blood ) as an additional , intermediary node .
Thus , in the conceptual schema of the EndoNet database ( Figure 1b ) , the links between cells / organs and hormone define donor cells ( ' D ' ) , those between cells / organs and receptors acceptor cells ( ' A ' ) .
If an acceptor cell synthesizes another hormone in response to an incoming signal , it becomes an internal node in the emerging hormonal network .
In EndoNet , the pathway between a hormone receptor expressed in an acceptor cell and a hormone synthesized in the same cell ( intracellular edge ) is handled as a black box .
In case of genome - encoded peptide hormones , cross - references to entries in the TRANSPATH (R) database , which describe the signaling cascade starting from the hormone ' s receptor and ending at the hormone ' s gene , are provided , if available .
Datasets on non - peptide hormones will in future be enriched by a specific metabolic add - on which will include references to the databases KEGG ( 1 ) and BRENDA ( 17 ) , allowing for further characterization of the steps performed during the hormone ' s synthesis and the regulation of both activity and expression of the enzymes involved .
By now , the EndoNet structure already allows for including descriptions of the physiological effects induced by hormone binding ( see below , Future Developments ) .
The contents of EndoNet
In the present version of EndoNet , and as a first approach , we consider the endocrine ( hormonal ) network of the human:__entity__ body .
For each molecule ( hormone or receptor ) , a primary name and synonyms are given .
In case of peptide hormones , the sequence of the processed polypeptide , rather than that of the protein precursor , is specified .
For a multimeric protein hormone , the subunit composition as well as the sequences of all subunits are stored ; the same holds true for hormone receptors .
Additionally , all peptide hormone and receptor datasets have links to HumanPSD (TM) ( 18 ) and to the Swiss - Prot database , The structures of non - peptide hormones can be accessed through the corresponding hyperlinks to the KEGG COMPOUND section .
Finally , all molecules may have links to the TRANSPATH (R) database .
As described , EndoNet utilizes data about the tissues from which hormones are secreted and in which receptors are expressed to define donor and acceptor cells , respectively .
The identity and anatomical environment of cell types , tissues and organs is defined through references to the CYTOMER (R) ontology ( 19 , 20 ) ; in the numerous cases where the receptors are ubiquitously expressed , just the root term ' human:__entity__ body ' is linked .
Data on whether a hormone ' s synthesis is triggered or inhibited by another hormone through its respective receptor in a particular cell was obtained by manual selection from textbooks [ e . g . ( 16 ) , ] , monographies ( 21 ) , original literature , the EST library information and the linked databases ( TRANSPATH (R) , HumanPSD (TM) and Swiss - Prot ) .
The contents of EndoNet are summarized in Table 1 .
Web interface , queries and visualization
EndoNet can be accessed through the WWW via a JSP - based web interface .
Hormones , receptors and tissues can be queried for their names , and detailed information on all identified components is available through individual characteristics pages .
Each hormone ' s individual entry page displays its source and target tissues ( donor and acceptor cells ) as well as its receptors , along with some molecular data .
Similarly , each receptor entry exhibits the tissues in which the receptor is expressed , and the hormones it interacts with .
Finally , each tissue entry lists the hormone receptors that are found in , as well as the hormones that are synthesized and secreted by the tissue .
It is also indicated whether the corresponding tissue exerts gender - specific properties ; additional information based on the CYTOMER (R) ontology is available through the corresponding link on the tissue detail page .
Instead of searching for a name of a hormone , one can also browse the hierarchical hormone classification featured by EndoNet ( available at the ' Search ' page ) .
Each query result can be used as starting point for an extended query .
Different items of interest can be selected and added to a common result set .
Since several search results can be combined , it is possible to create sets with multiple search parameters .
At any step of this incremental retrieval process , the sets of hormones , receptors and tissues obtained so far can be used as starting points for reconstructing a network by a depth - first graph traversal algorithm .
The maximum number of steps can be selected separately for the upstream and downstream part of the reconstruction process .
Subsequently , the graph will be displayed using a Graphviz - based visualization method [ ( 22 ) , ] .
In the resulting image , hormones and receptors are represented as nodes grouped together into subgraphs representing the tissues ( cells / organs ) they are secreted from or expressed in , respectively ( Figure 2 ) .
Autocrine loops ( donor and acceptor cell being identical ) are treated specially for visualization .
On demand , the hormones ' transport media can be included in the visualization of intercellular edges , enabling the user to choose between different complexities of output .
Intracellular edges , which connect a receptor to a hormone , represent the influence of a receptor ' s activation on the secretion of a hormone from the same cell and are displayed differently , depending on whether this influence is triggering or inhibitory in nature .
The graph is displayed as a clickable image map , linking each entity to its detailed characteristics page , thus making the database entries accessible from the graphical overview of a network , too .
The graph is available in two different formats : PNG and SVG .
While virtually every browser supports PNG ( a ' pixel ' or ' bitmap ' format ) , only a few of them provide a zoom functionality for bitmap pictures .
Scalable vector graphics , ( SVG ) provides more functionality ( including perfect image quality throughout all zoom factors ) , but until now most browsers do not support SVG natively and require an SVG plugin ( ) for displaying this vector - based format .
Some well - established endocrine pathways are offered as showcases in the form of predefined result sets .
For instance , sets representing the hypothalamic - hypophyseal axis with a focus on either thyroid hormones , adrenal hormones , growth hormones or prolactin are provided .
These predefined sets can be used for obtaining a quick overview or as starting points for more complex queries .
FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
Among the important improvements of EndoNet which we are currently working on is the possibility to represent intercellular communication at different levels of the hierarchical organization of organs , tissues and cells in the organism , as well as to distinguish between such communications in male and female organisms .
These options will be introduced by a tighter integration with the CYTOMER - based ontology ( 19 , 20 ) .
The next step will be to expand the contents of EndoNet towards the details of the processes occurring in the transport medium , usually the blood .
Since not all hormones are transported as free molecules and some hydrophobic hormones ( e . g . steroids and thyroids ) need to be bound to specific carrier proteins , proper description of such transporters and their interaction with the corresponding hormones will be required .
It is planned to involve quantitative data about the regular or pathological levels of the hormones , the overall kinetics of each hormone in the blood ( monotonous decay , oscillating concentrations , increase in response to certain stimuli , etc . ) , its turnover and metabolic products , etc .
That will allow utilization of EndoNet contents for diagnostic purposes .
In future , the EndoNet data model will be extended in order to incorporate external stimuli ( e . g . light ) and physiological states ( stress , age , etc . ) in a formalized manner , allowing to determine whether or not and in which quantity a hormone will be secreted under the given circumstances .
EndoNet will then link the physiological effects of hormones with the intracellular molecular processes leading to its synthesis and secretion in the donor cells , and to the effects on its acceptor cells .
At many places of these intracellular and intercellular networks , genetically determined aberrations may cause specific , sometimes pathological phenotypes .
Thus , EndoNet will enable to bridge the gap between known genotypes and their molecular and clinical phenotypes in this area of medical research and its applications .
DISCUSSION
At its present state , EndoNet provides a high coverage of molecules that are conventionally considered as hormones as well as other molecules that are involved in intercellular communication , such as growth factors , lymphokines and chemokines and their known receptors .
The aim of the database is to provide a useful resource for studying the principal features of hormonal networks in a comprehensive way , as it was done more exemplarily in the past for these kinds of networks ( 23 ) , but was done globally for many other intracellular network types , such as metabolic , protein interaction and transcription networks [ reviewed in ( 24 , 25 ) ] .
EndoNet database certainly is not yet complete but will grow rapidly .
Gender differences in factors influencing insulin resistance in elderly hyperlipemic non - diabetic subjects
Abstract
Background
The increase in the prevalence of insulin resistance - related metabolic syndrome , a disorder that greatly increases the risk of diabetes , heart attack and stroke , is alarming .
One of the most frequent and early symptoms of metabolic syndrome is hypertriglyceridemia .
We examined the gender differences between various metabolic factors related to insulin resistance in elderly non - diabetic men:__entity__ and postmenopausal women:__entity__ of comparable age suffering from hypertriglyceridemia , and compared them with healthy subjects of equal age .
Results
The indexes of insulin resistance HOMA IR and QUICKI were significantly higher in both hyperlipemic men:__entity__ and women:__entity__ than in controls ; 95 % confidence limits of hyperlipemic subjects did not overlap with controls .
In both normolipemic and hyperlipemic men:__entity__ and women:__entity__ serum leptin correlated significantly with insulin resistance , while HDL - cholesterol correlated inversely with HOMA - IR only in women:__entity__ ( both normo - and hyperlipemic ) , and serum tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF alpha ) only in hyperlipemic women:__entity__ .
According to results of multiple regression analysis with HOMA - IR as a dependent variable , leptin played a significant role in determining insulin resistance in both genders , but - aside from leptin - triglycerides , TNF alpha and decreased HDL - cholesterol were significant determinants in women:__entity__ , while body mass index and decreased HDL - cholesterol were significant determinants in men:__entity__ .
The coefficient of determination ( R2 ) of HOMA IR by above mentioned metabolic variables was in women:__entity__ above 60 % , in men:__entity__ only about 40 % .
Conclusion
The significant role of serum leptin in determination of insulin resistance in both elderly men:__entity__ and postmenopausal women:__entity__ of equal age was confirmed .
However , the study also revealed significant gender differences : in women:__entity__ a strong influence of triglycerides , TNF alpha and decreased HDL - cholesterol , in men:__entity__ only a mild role of BMI and decreased HDL - cholesterol .
Background
In association with pandemic obesity the prevalence of the insulin resistance - related metabolic syndrome is constantly growing [ 1 ] .
As a consequence of this fact , type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular mortality occurs in much younger age groups [ 2 ] .
A typical hyperlipemia , consisting of an increase of serum triglycerides and a decrease of serum HDL - cholesterol , is a characteristic and an early symptom of this syndrome [ 3 ] .
With increasing age , body mass index ( BMI ) and adiposity , insulin sensitivity declines and the number of cardiovascular risk factors increases in both genders [ 4 - 6 ] .
It was repeatedly demonstrated that plasma concentration of leptin - a hormone produced mainly by adipose tissue - is substantially higher in all age groups of women:__entity__ than in men:__entity__ [ 7 - 10 ] .
This may be caused by different size and / or distribution of fat tissue compartments influenced by hormones : estrogens stimulate , whereas testosterone inhibits leptin secretion .
In women:__entity__ subcutaneous fat mass prevails - and during augmentation of overweight it increases - while in men:__entity__ intra - abdominal fat mass prevails [ 11 - 13 ] .
Subcutaneous fat in particular serves as a substantial source of tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF alpha ) , which represents one of the factors that interfere with insulin signal transduction into the cells [ 14 - 16 ] .
Leptin , TNF alpha and some other factors are abundantly expressed in adipose tissue and contribute to the insulin resistance that accompanies overweight and obesity .
Leptin correlates positively with hyperinsulinemia , BMI , fat mass and hypertriglyceridemia , respectively , and correlates inversely with HDL - cholesterol and lean body mass [ 17 - 25 ] .
The incidence and mortality of ischemic heart disease and of other consequences of atherosclerosis increases with age in both genders , especially after the age of sixty .
In premenopausal women:__entity__ , however , the incidence of these disorders is considerably less frequent than in men:__entity__ of appropriate age .
After the menopause the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular mortality in women:__entity__ gradually increases , attaining values comparable to men:__entity__ at about the age of 70 [ 2 , 26 ] .
Paradoxically , it takes place at the time when serum leptin concentration in women:__entity__ has relatively decreased [ 27 , 28 ] .
The aim of this study was to analyze the interrelations between several metabolic variables and factors related to insulin resistance in groups of both normal and hyperlipemic postmenopausal women:__entity__ and men:__entity__ of appropriate age , and to attempt to elucidate the gender differences and some pathophysiologic mechanisms of these differences .
We compared homeostatic indexes of insulin resistance HOMA IR and QUICKI , serum lipid and insulin parameters , uric acid , leptin and TNF alpha between groups of subjects without apparent symptoms of metabolic syndrome , and groups showing mild hypertriglyceridemia with decreased HDL - cholesterol .
In addition , serum concentration of the heart fraction of fatty acid binding protein ( hFATP ) was explored as a factor that might reflect the regulative role of PPAR gamma in lipid homeostasis [ 29 , 30 ] , and serum IgG anticardiolipin ( ACL - IgG ) was investigated as an indirect indicator of oxidized lipid fractions related to atherosclerotic complications [ 31 , 32 ] .
Methods
Subjects
The study was carried out on 70 out - patients:__entity__ of the Metabolic Center at the hospital in Sternberk , Czech Republic .
From these , 40 patients:__entity__ ( 20 men:__entity__ and 20 women:__entity__ ) were selected with mild hyperlipidemia , i . e . with plasma triglyceride concentration exceeding 2 . 0 mmol / l , total cholesterol exceeding 6 . 0 mmol / l , LDL cholesterol exceeding 4 . 0 mmol / l , and with HDL cholesterol concentration in men:__entity__ under 1 . 0 mmol / l , and in women:__entity__ under 1 . 2 mmol / l .
These groups were denominated as " hyperlipemic " .
Two other groups ( 10 men:__entity__ and 20 women:__entity__ ) with approximately normal serum values of these variables were taken as " controls " .
The average age in men:__entity__ was 59 . 1 +/- 10 . 6 y , and in women:__entity__ 59 . 4 +/- 10 . 1 y , respectively .
The differences between lipid parameters of hyperlipemic and control groups were highly statistically significant , while the age differences were insignificant ( see Table 1 ) .
None of the patients:__entity__ had clinically apparent diabetes mellitus , but some of the hyperlipemic patients:__entity__ exerted impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose ( values between 6 . 1 and 7 . 0 mmol / l , or between 6 . 1 and 7 . 8 mmol / l , respectively ) .
None of the patients:__entity__ was treated with insulin , peroral antidiabetics or antihyperlipemic drugs ; some of them were treated with antihypertensive therapy .
No signs of major clinical or laboratory symptoms of other diseases were present in any group of the explored patients:__entity__ .
Blood samples were obtained in the morning via a venipuncture after overnight fasting .
After clotting the serum was separated and stored at - 20 degrees until used .
An informed consent was obtained from all probands .
Body mass indexes ( BMI ) , defined as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters , were calculated .
Biochemical methods
Serum leptin concentrations were measured by a sandwich ELISA test kit ( Human:__entity__ Leptin ELISA , BioVendor Laboratory Medicine , Inc , Czech Republic ) .
Its sensitivity limit was 0 . 2 ng / ml , intraassay CV 6 . 1 % at the level of 7 . 5 ng / m , inter - assay CV 8 . 5 % at the level of 4 . 8 ng / ml .
Tetramethylbenzidine was used as a substrate ; quality controls were human:__entity__ based .
Several other hormones and peptides were estimated by routine immunochemical tests : insulin , C - peptide , TNF alpha ( IMMULITE , Diagnostic Products Corporation , Los Angeles , CA , U . S . A . ) , proinsulin intact ( DAKO , Denmark ) , IgG anticardiolipin ( ACL - IgG , IMMCO Diagnostics , Buffalo , NY , U . S . A . ) and heart fatty acid binding protein ( hFABP , Hbt HUMAN H - FABP , HyCult Biotechnology , Uden , the Netherlands ) .
Serum concentration of glucose , total cholesterol , triglycerides , HDL - cholesterol , LDL - cholesterol , Apoprotein B and uric acid were measured on a ILAB - 600 biochemical analyzer ( Instrumentation Laboratory , Lexington , Ma , U . S . A . ) using BioVendor sets .
All samples were processed and examined according to principles of good laboratory practice and under constant intralaboratory and external quality control .
The homeostatic indexes of insulin resistance ( HOMA IR and QUICKI ) were calculated according to the homeostasis model of assessment [ 33 - 35 ] as follows :
HOMA IR = fasting insulin ( mu U / ml ) * fasting glucose ( mmol / l ) / 22 . 5 ;
QUICKI = 1 / [ log fasting insulin ( mu U / ml ) + log fasting glucose ( mg / 100 ml ) ] .
Statistics
Statistical analysis was performed using the Version 6 SAS / STAT software ( SAS Institute , Inc . , Cary , NC , U . S . A . ) .
The Shapiro - Wilks tests were used in testing the normality of distribution .
Some of the data obtained were not normally distributed .
The statistical significance of differences between the means in the hyperlipemic and control groups were evaluated using the unpaired Student ' s T - test in the case of normal distribution of data sets , and using the Kolmogorov - Smirnov test when at least in one of the data sets the normal distribution was excluded .
Spearman ' s rank - order correlation was used for correlation analysis .
Multiple regression analysis was performed using HOMA IR indexes of insulin resistance as dependent variables , and other metabolic and hormonal factors ( lipid parameters , BMI , leptin , TNF alpha , hFABP , ACL - IgG ) as independent variables .
The so - called step - down regression model was used to select dominant independent variables .
Various four - member groups of independent ( explanatory ) variables were used for the analysis and the non - zero intercept was taken into account .
The independent variables were then dropped , one at a time ; at each stage one variable making the least contribution to the dependent variable ( i . e . that showed the least p - value in the test of the regression coefficient being zero ) was excluded .
The coefficient of determination R2 , which can be viewed as a percentage explaining the total variance , was simultaneously monitored .
A great drop in R2 after excluding some independent variable enabled selection of those independent variables that could be thought to be the most important determinants of the dependent variable .
Results
Table 1 demonstrates mean parameters in individual groups of subjects matched according to sex , lipid parameters and age .
While the age of all four groups did not differ substantially , the concentrations of total serum cholesterol , triglycerides , HDL - cholesterol and LDL - cholesterol differ very significantly in both male and female hyperlipemic groups as compared with controls .
In addition , the concentration of triglycerides in control women:__entity__ was significantly higher than in control men:__entity__ , the concentration of triglycerides in hyperlipemic women:__entity__ was lower than in hyperlipemic men:__entity__ , and the concentration of HDL - cholesterol in hyperlipemic women:__entity__ was very significantly higher when compared with hyperlipemic men:__entity__ .
Table 2 shows the values of other metabolic and insulin parameters , factors related to insulin resistance and indexes of insulin resistance , respectively .
Body mass indexes and uric acid concentration were significantly higher in hyperlipemic men:__entity__ as compared to controls , but not in hyperlipemic women:__entity__ .
Uric acid concentration was substantially lower in hyperlipemic women:__entity__ than in hyperlipemic men:__entity__ .
Plasma concentrations of glycemia , insulin and intact proinsulin were significantly higher in both hyperlipemic men:__entity__ and women:__entity__ as compared with controls of identical gender , while the concentration of leptin increased only in hyperlipemic men:__entity__ .
However , serum leptin concentrations of both control and hyperlipemic women:__entity__ were significantly higher than in corresponding groups of men:__entity__ .
Serum concentrations of TNF alpha , hFABP and ACL - IgG in hyperlipemic groups of both men:__entity__ and women:__entity__ were not significantly different from control groups .
On the other hand , the indexes of insulin resistance HOMA IR and QUICKI differed very significantly in hyperlipemic groups of both men:__entity__ and women:__entity__ as compared with corresponding control groups , more distinctly in women:__entity__ .
From Fig .
1 , presenting 95 % confidence limits of insulin resistance indexes HOMA IR and QUICKI , we concluded that in groups of hyperlipemic patients:__entity__ of both genders the insulin resistance was substantially higher than in control groups ; the groups did not overlap each other .
In Table 3 the results of Spearman ' s correlations between insulin resistance index HOMA IR and various metabolic parameters are presented .
In the control group of men:__entity__ , positive significant correlation between HOMA IR and serum leptin concentration , and inverse significant correlation between HOMA IR and ACL IgG , respectively , were found .
In the control group of women:__entity__ , the significance of Spearman ' s correlation between HOMA IR and leptin was more expressive ; inverse correlation between HOMA IR and HDL - cholesterol was also present .
In the hyperlipemic group of men:__entity__ , the significance of the correlation between HOMA IR was more expressive in relation to the control group , and no significant correlation between HOMA IR and ACL IgG was found .
In the hyperlipemic group of women:__entity__ , however , the significance of Spearman ' s correlation between HOMA IR and serum leptin concentration weakened , the inverse correlation between HOMA IR and HDL - cholesterol remained approximately unchanged , and a positive correlation between HOMA IR and serum concentration of TNF alpha appeared .
Table 4 shows results of multiple regression analysis , when data from both control and hyperlipemic groups of each gender were judged together .
HOMA IR was considered as a dependent variable and differently changed constellations of metabolic and other factors were taken as independent variables .
In men:__entity__ , BMI and leptin seemed to play a main role in influencing the insulin resistance index HOMA IR , while TGL , ACL IgG and LDL - cholesterol didn ' t play any significant role ( see left columns of Table 4 ) .
The decreasing of HDL - cholesterol concentration may also have some influence ( see a significant drop of R2 after exclusion of this factor in Table 4A , 4B ) .
But in the presence of leptin in the group of independent factors , the drop of R2 after exclusion of HDL - cholesterol from these factors was minimal ( see Table 4C ) .
On the other hand , after the exclusion of TNF alpha from the group of independent variables ( see Table 4B , 4D ) the value of R2 has unexpectedly risen , which could reflect the interference of TNF alpha with factors increasing the insulin resistance .
In women:__entity__ ( see right columns of Table 4 ) , the maximal values of R2 were achieved with combination of independent variables containing TGL , leptin and HDL - cholesterol ( about 60 % influence on HOMA IR ! - see Table 4A , 4B , 4C ) .
TNF alpha seemed to play quite a different role than in men:__entity__ : after exclusion of this factor from the group of independent factors R2significantly decreased ( see Table 4B , 4D ) .
In contrast to men:__entity__ , the role of BMI seemed to be minimal .
As in men:__entity__ , the role of ACL IgG and LDL - cholesterol in influencing HOMA IR was negligible , but in contrast to men:__entity__ , hFABP might play a certain role in this process ( see Table 4D ) .
Generally , the insulin resistance ( represented by HOMA IR ) was in men:__entity__ much less influenced by metabolic variables than in women:__entity__ ; while in women:__entity__ in some combinations of dependent variables R2 reached 64 % , in men:__entity__ the maximal value of R2 was only 39 % .
Discussion
In our previous paper [ 36 ] , the mean value of HOMA IR in healthy subjects of both genders and of age comparable with our controls was 1 . 57 +/- 0 . 87 , and the mean value of index QUICKI 0 . 366 +/- 0 . 029 , respectively .
These values , as well as the 95 % confidence limits , correspond to values found in controls in this study .
In accordance with many previous papers , serum concentrations of leptin in women:__entity__ ( both control and hyperlipemic ) were substantially higher than in men:__entity__ .
In the control group of women:__entity__ the correlation between leptin and HOMA IR was highly significant .
However , in hyperlipemic women:__entity__ the significance of this correlation lessened , because HOMA IR increased considerably ( and significantly ) but serum concentration of leptin only slightly ( insignificantly ) .
In men:__entity__ the significance of correlations between serum leptin and HOMA IR was high and approximately the same in both the control and hyperlipemic groups , because the values of HOMA IR as well as serum leptin have nearly doubled in hyperlipemic in relation to control groups .
In non - hyperlipemic postmenopausal women:__entity__ the high concentration of serum leptin was not associated with higher insulin resistance : HOMA IR did not differ substantially from men:__entity__ .
A significant increase of insulin resistance in hyperlipemic women:__entity__ was associated by only slight and insignificant increase of leptin concentration .
According to Spearman ' s correlations , an increase of serum TNF alpha and / or a decrease of HDL - cholesterol might also play a distinct role in this respect .
( see Table 3 ) .
In contrast to women:__entity__ , in hyperlipemic men:__entity__ the increase of insulin resistance index was approximately proportional with the increase of leptin concentration .
Multiple regression analysis affirmed the importance of leptin serum in increasing of insulin resistance in both genders .
In men:__entity__ , only BMI and HDL - cholesterol from other factors studied seemed to play a certain role , but the maximal values of influencing HOMA IR reached only 39 % , with leptin and BMI being the more important factors .
On the other hand , in women:__entity__ the maximal determination of HOMA IR as high as 60 % was registered in combination of serum leptin , TGL and decreased HDL - cholesterol as independent factors ; the role of BMI was insignificant .
It is not known how leptin is regulated .
A strong correlation between plasma leptin and fasting insulin undoubtedly exists , but hyperleptinemia in both obese and lean humans:__entity__ is not likely the result of hyperinsulinemia [ 37 ] .
A relationship between leptin and insulin dependent on sex or BMI was reported , but relationship between triglyceride concentrations and leptin was independent of sex , BMI , and insulin [ 18 , 24 ] .
Hyperleptinemia , as an early sign of obesity , was closely linked to subcutaneous fat mass [ 39 , 40 ] .
Percentage of body fat has been shown to be the strongest predictor of leptin levels even in lean women:__entity__ [ 41 ] .
Leptin was highly correlated with percentage of body fat and with fat mass in adults irrespective of gender and age ; however , the mean determinant of leptin plasma concentration in men:__entity__ and postmenopausal women:__entity__ was BMI , while in premenopausal women:__entity__ it was only the fat mass [ 42 ] .
These findings contrast with our results showing minimal influence of BMI on HOMA IR in postmenopausal women:__entity__ .
All factors mentioned are connected with fat tissue : leptin and TNF alpha are directly produced chiefly by adipocytes , BMI growth is obviously accompanied by fat mass increase , and the typical hypertriglyceridemia associated with a decrease of HDL - cholesterol goes along with obesity and fat mass growth .
The gender differences in circulating leptin were best explained by percentage of body fat and - inversely - by lean body mass [ 25 ] .
In both genders the intra - abdominal fat correlated with insulin resistance , while the subcutaneous fat correlated with circulating leptin [ 11 , 12 ] .
In men:__entity__ obesity led to a prevalent increase of intra - abdominal fat , while in women:__entity__ of subcutaneous fat [ 13 ] .
Influences of different compartments of adipose tissues could elucidate the variability of correlations between insulin resistance and high leptin concentrations in lean and obese subjects of both genders [ 43 ] .
In our non - hyperlipemic postmenopausal women:__entity__ the content of subcutaneous fat mass might be higher than in non - hyperlipemic men:__entity__ of appropriate age , which indicated a higher serum concentration of leptin .
However , the insulin resistance - related to intra - abdominal fat mass - did not differ from men:__entity__ .
The significant increase of insulin resistance and leptin concentration in hyperlipemic men:__entity__ might reflect the growing content of both subcutaneous and intra - abdominal fat mass ( see the significant increase of BMI ) .
In hyperlipemic women:__entity__ the significant increase of insulin resistance accompanying only minimal insignificant increase of leptin could be caused by prevalent growing of intra - abdominal fat mass .
In elderly postmenopausal women:__entity__ , an association between leptin and plasma lipoprotein concentration was found which depended on adiposity [ 17 ] , and inverse correlations between serum leptin and HDL - cholesterol were described [ 44 ] .
In our study , insulin resistance in women:__entity__ seemed to be more notably than in men:__entity__ influenced by lipid disorders , i . e . positively by serum triglycerides and inversely by HDL - cholesterol .
These findings might be important in considering the concept of treatment of insulin resistance - related disorders in postmenopausal women:__entity__ .
The significant role of TNF alpha in insulin resistance , caused by inhibiting the transduction of insulin signaling and by down - regulation of glucose transporter GLUT - 4 and insulin receptor substrate - 1 , has been repeatedly confirmed [ 45 - 48 ] .
Our results supported these findings unambiguously only in women:__entity__ , while in men:__entity__ TNF alpha seemed paradoxically to interfere with other factors - mainly BMI and leptin - in influencing insulin resistance , thus playing a quite different role .
Previously it was found [ 46 ] that correlation between serum TNF alpha on the one side , and insulin , HOMA IR , serum triglycerids , respectively , on the other side , was substantially more significant in women:__entity__ than in men:__entity__ .
Serum concentration of TNF alpha in patients:__entity__ with type 2 diabetes of both genders correlated only with the quantity of intra - abdominal fat compartment [ 50 ] .
Visceral obesity correlated with plasmatic aldosterone and with insulin resistance only in premenopausal women:__entity__ , but not in men:__entity__ [ 51 ] .
From all these data we might support our above mentioned conclusion - that rising of insulin resistance in hyperlipemic women:__entity__ was associated with an increase of intra - abdominal fat , because this fat mass in particular is a source of TNF alpha , which interfered with insulin sensitivity only in women:__entity__ .
We came to this conclusion irrespective of the finding that the increase of serum TNF alpha in hyperlipemic women:__entity__ was statistically insignificant ; results of Spearman ' s correlation ( Table 3 ) and multiple regression analysis confirm a distinct role of this factor .
In hyperlipemic men:__entity__ not only the serum concentration of TNF alpha has decreased instead of increasing , but according to multiple regression analysis it played a quite different role in influencing insulin sensitivity , interfering with factors that determined insulin resistance ( leptin and BMI ) .
In the control group of men:__entity__ IgG anticardiolipin was inversely correlated to HOMA IR .
The significance of this finding is not clear .
These antibodies indicate vascular and thrombotic complications and oxidative modification of lipoproteins [ 52 , 53 ] and may represent an increased risk of atherogenic and inflammatory complications .
In this case , however , their growing might be connected with an increase in insulin sensitivity .
Anyway , ACL IgG evidently did not participate significantly in influencing the increase of insulin resistance associated with hyperlipidemia , although other anti - cardiolipin correlations could be masked by the relatively large inter - individual variations in this parameter .
Neither serum concentration of hFABP , a factor ensuring transmembrane transport and oxidative metabolisation of long - chain fatty acids [ 54 , 55 ] , was significantly changed in hyperlipemic and insulin resistant subjects of both genders .
This factor was very weakly associated only with HOMA IR in women:__entity__ ( see Table 4D ) , indicating that enhanced metabolisation of fatty acids in cells might to some degree contribute to insulin resistance .
Conclusions
In postmenopausal women:__entity__ as well as in men:__entity__ of approximately equal age serum leptin plays a significant role as an important determinant of insulin resistance .
In addition to this factor , in women:__entity__ the grade of insulin resistance is very considerably influenced by serum triglycerides , tumor necrosis factor alpha , and by decreased concentration of HDL - cholesterol , while in men:__entity__ only a mild influence of BMI and decreased HDL - cholesterol is observed .
These findings are explained as a consequence of gender - related differences in adipose tissue composition and / or distribution in both normal - weight and over - weight subjects and should be taken into account in treatment of patients:__entity__ with metabolic risk factors of cardiovascular diseases .

Alexithymia and anxiety in female chronic pain patients:__entity__
Abstract
Objectives
Alexithymia is highly prevalent among chronic pain patients:__entity__ .
Pain is a remarkable cause for high levels of chronic anxiety .
The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of alexithymia and to determine anxiety levels among DSM - IV somatoform pain disorder ( chronic pain ) female patients:__entity__ and to examine the relationship between alexithymia and the self - reporting of pain .
Methods
Thirty adult females ( mean age : 34 , 63 +/- 10 , 62 years ) , who applied to the outpatient psychiatry clinic at a public hospital with the diagnosis of chronic pain disorder ( DSM - IV ) , were included in the study .
Thirty seven healthy females ( mean age : 34 , 46 +/- 7 , 43 years ) , who matched for sociodemographic features with the patient:__entity__ group , consisted the control group .
A sociodemographic data form , 26 - item Toronto Alexithymia Scale ( TAS - 26 ) , Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) were administered to each subject and information was obtained on several aspects of the patients:__entity__ ' pain , including intensity ( measured by VAS ) , and duration .
Results
Chronic pain patients:__entity__ were found significantly more alexithymic than controls .
There was a positive correlation between TAS - 26 scores and the duration of pain .
The alexithymic and nonalexithymic group did not differ in their perception of pain .
Neither positive correlation nor significant difference was found between alexithymia and trait anxiety in pain patients:__entity__ .
Discussion
Alexithymia may be important in addressing the diversity of subjective factors involved in pain .
The conceptualization of alexithymia as a personality trait as well as a secondary state reaction is underlined by our data .
Background
The original definition of alexithymia is the inability to identify and use verbal language to describe feelings [ 1 , 2 ] .
Alexithymia has been associated with a variety of psychiatric disorders as well as physical illness [ 3 - 10 ] .
As a measure , Toronto Alexithymia Scale was significantly correlated with the measures of the tendency to experience and report physical signs and symptoms [ 11 ] .
Several studies have found a high prevalence of alexithymia in pain patients:__entity__ .
Chronic pain patients:__entity__ frequently exhibit many of the core features of alexithymia , such as problems in identifying and describing subjective feelings , impoverished imaginative abilities , and excessive preoccupation with physical symptoms and external events .
Although several studies have found a high prevalence of alexithymia in pain patients:__entity__ , the way alexithymia may possibly influence pain experience is still unclear [ 12 , 13 ] .
DSM - IV - TR defines pain disorder as the presence of pain that is " the predominant focus of clinical attention " [ 14 ] .
In chronic pain disorder , patients:__entity__ complain of chronic pain , for which no physical etiology could be found or the underlying disorder is insufficient in explaining the symptoms .
The pain causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social , occupational , or other important areas of functioning .
Psychological factors are judged to have an important role in the onset , severity , exacerbation , or maintenance of the pain [ 15 ] .
The alexithymic person:__entity__ ' s difficulty in identifying and describing feelings may increase symptom reporting by several mechanisms .
Consequently , due to the difficulty to experience and express emotions , alexithymia has been linked with somatosensory amplification , which is the tendency to focus on benign somatic sensations .
Alexithymic subjects are considered to focus on somatic manifestations of emotional arousal , resulting in misinterpretation of somatic sensations as signs of physical illness [ 12 , 13 , 16 ] .
Accordingly , previous studies have found evidence of an association between alexithymia and the development of functional somatic symptoms , as seen in patients:__entity__ with somatoform disorders .
On the other hand , alexithymia may also occur as a secondary state reaction in response to severe and chronic medical illness [ 17 - 21 ] .
Based on previous findings , these factors are worth receiving more attention in terms of clinical research .
The purpose of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of alexithymia among DSM - IV somatoform pain disorder ( chronic pain ) female patients:__entity__ and to examine the relationship between alexithymia and the self - reporting of pain in this group of patients:__entity__ .
Besides , the study searched for the anxiety levels of chronic pain patients:__entity__ with or without alexithymia .
Materials and methods
Sample
The sample consisted of 30 females who applied to the outpatient psychiatry clinic at a public hospital and who met DSM - IV diagnostic criteria for chronic pain disorder .
Patients:__entity__ with concomitant psychiatric disorders , such as major depression , anxiety disorders and somatoform disorders other than pain disorder were excluded .
Patients:__entity__ either directly applied to the psychiatry clinic themselves or were referred for psychiatric assessment from another outpatient clinic , mainly physical medicine and rehabilitation .
After complete description of the study , written informed consent was obtained from each subject .
The control group was 37 healthy females , who matched for age , and education with the subjects .
All subjects participated voluntarily in the study and gave consent after the procedure had been fully explained to them .
The mean age of the patients:__entity__ and the healthy controls was 34 , 63 +/- 10 , 62 ( range : 16 - 62 ) and 34 , 46 +/- 7 , 43 ( range : 22 - 57 ) years and the educational level was 6 , 13 +/- 3 , 03 ( range : 5 - 11 ) and 6 , 59 +/- 2 , 9 ( range : 5 - 14 ) years , respectively .
There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to age ( t = 0 , 79 , df = 65 , P > 0 , 05 ) , educational level ( t = 1 , 02 , df = 65 , P > 0 , 05 ) , and marital status ( x2 = 0 , 51 , df = 1 , P > 0 , 05 ) .
Measures
A detailed sociodemographic data form was used for all subjects .
All participants:__entity__ were applied Structured Clinical Interview for DSM - IV ( SCID - I ) [ 22 ] , Turkish version [ 23 ] .
Regarding the pain assessment , information was first obtained on several aspects of the patients:__entity__ ' pain , such as intensity , and duration .
Pain intensity was measured by Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) , using a horizontal 10 - cm line with the statement ' no pain at all ' at the extreme left - hand end and ' the worst possible pain ' or ' unbearable ' at the right - hand extreme .
VAS is scored by measuring the distance from the end of the scale indicating absence of pain ( or no distress or no pain relief ) to the place marked by the patient:__entity__ [ 24 ] .
The psychometric scales used in the study were the 26 - item Toronto Alexithymia Scale ( TAS - 26 ] and the Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) , which were both validated in Turkish population studies [ 25 - 28 ] .
TAS is a psychometrically well validated and reliable instrument in the assessment of alexithymia . TAS has been validated in Turkish studies as a true or false scale .
Twenty - six items are scored either as 1 or 0 and the higher scores indicate higher degrees of alexithymia .
TAS has an interval consistency of 0 . 65 [ Kuder - Richardson ) and test - retest reliability is r = 0 . 71 , p < 0 . 01 in Turkish reliability and validity study .
The sample was divided into nonalexithymic and alexityhmic groups , with the recommended cut - off score of 11 [ 27 ] .
Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) is one of the two sections of the Spielberger Anxiety Inventory ( the other , measuring state anxiety ) .
' Trait anxiety ' has been defined as anxiety proneness , that is , the tendency to respond to situations perceived as threatening with elevations in the intensity of state anxiety [ 26 ] .
Statistical analysis
In order to determine the relative importance of a number of factors in pain disorders , we used both correlation analyses .
The alexithymic and nonalexithymic groups were compared using the independent sample t - tests on scores of psychological tests .
The statistical procedure , which was carried out by a SPSS package program for Windows using Chi - square , Fisher ' s exact test , two tailed t test and Pearson correlation coefficients , was also used to determine group differences ( alexithymics versus nonalexithymics ) in sociodemographic variables and various aspects of pain .
Results
In the chronic pain group , 56 . 7 % of patients:__entity__ ( n = 17 ) had a score greater than 11 on the TAS - 26 , and were considered alexithymic .
The mean TAS - 26 score of the alexithymic group ( n = 17 ) was 17 . 88 +/- 3 . 43 and the nonalexithymic group ( n = 13 ) was 8 . 39 +/- 2 . 02 .
Age ( t = 1 , 38 , df = 28 , p > 0 , 18 ) , education ( t = - 0 , 21 , df = 28 , p > 0 , 16 ) and marital status ( x2 = 0 , 27 , df = 1 , p > 0 , 87 ) were not associated with alexithymia ( Table 1 ) .
In the control group , 24 , 3 % of patients:__entity__ ( n = 9 ) were alexithymic according to TAS - 26 .
The mean TAS - 26 score of the alexithymic group ( n = 9 ) was 13 , 82 +/- 1 , 93 and the nonalexithymic group ( n = 28 ) was 10 , 33 +/- 0 , 86 .
Alexithymia was not associated with age ( t = - 1 , 08 , df = 35 , p > 0 , 29 ) , educational level ( t = 1 , 1 , df = 35 , p > 0 , 28 ) , or marital status ( x2 = 0 , 74 , df = 1 , p > 0 , 79 ) or anxiety levels in the control subjects ( Table 1 ) .
The duration and severity of pain , TAS - 26 scores , and STAI scores of the female pain patients:__entity__ are shown in Table 2 .
Comparison of the alexithymics with nonalexithymics on either the severity of pain or pain duration showed no statistical significance ( t = 0 , 64 , df = 28 , p > 0 , 52 , t = 2 , 05 , df = 28 , p > 0 , 05 , respectively ) .
TAS - 26 score and duration of pain were found positively correlated ( r = 0 , 50 , n = 30 , p > 0 , 005 ) .
STAI ( trait ) scores of the alexithymics in the pain group did not significantly differ from the nonlalexithymics ( t = 0 , 06 , df = 28 , p > 0 , 95 ) and besides , TAS - 26 and STAI scores were not correlated ( r = 0 , 06 , p > 0 , 72 ) .
In summary , there are three points to be emphasized .
First , chronic pain patients:__entity__ were found significantly more alexithymic than controls ( 56 , 7 % to 24 , 3 % ) .
Second , a positive correlation was observed between TAS - 26 scores and duration of pain .
Third , neither positive correlation nor significant difference was found between alexithymia and trait anxiety in pain patients:__entity__ .
Discussion
The results of the present study suggest that patients:__entity__ with chronic pain disorder are more alexithymic than individuals with no pain .
This finding is consistent with results obtained with earlier measures of alexithymia [ 11 - 13 ] .
Although they may share common clinical features , alexithymia and somatoform pain are independent constructs .
Alexithymia may be a consequence to the effects of severe physical symptoms , such as a reduced quality of life and limitations in daily activities .
Besides , alexithymia may be conceptualized as a personality trait as well as a secondary state reaction [ 2 , 3 , 15 - 17 ] .
In this study , the question investigated was whether alexithymia has any correlation with the duration or severity of the pain itself .
There were no significant differences between alexithymic and nonalexitymic patients:__entity__ on self reports of current pain severity .
This is in accordance with Cox ' s study [ 1994 ] in which it was further pointed out that alexithymic patients:__entity__ were found to use significantly more verbal descriptors of pain compared to nonalexithymic patients:__entity__ [ 13 ] .
In our study , pain intensity was only evaluated by using VAS .
One problem in trying to measure the intensity of pain is the lack of an objective way .
Pain is a subjective experience and each patient:__entity__ may communicate in a different way , verbally or nonverbally [ 29 ] .
Patients:__entity__ in this sample were sufferers of chronic pain , who had already chosen an approved way of expressing their distress .
Since this is true regardless of alexithymia , alexithymic groups and nonalexithymic groups in this sample showed no difference on pain severity .
The positive correlation between alexithymia and the duration of pain in this sample supports the assumption of a two - way hypothesis .
It is often assumed that pain can be caused by alexithymic personality traits and also that severe and chronic pain may cause emotional change .
One of the limitations of this study is that because of the cross - sectional design , we are unable to draw conclusions about the direction of causality between alexithymia and pain .
The duration of the patients:__entity__ ' pain could approximately be determined , yet the preexisting level of alexithymia was not known .
In the usual absence of internal stimuli , alexithymic person:__entity__ may be expected to maintain an external focus of attention , such as pain .
Symptom chronicity may force the alexithymic person:__entity__ to attent to and amplify this somatic sensation .
Difficulties in the ability to identify and differentiate emotions and somatic experiences are core features of the alexithymic construct .
Therefore , alexithymic patients:__entity__ might be expected to differ from nonalexithymic ones in their anxiety levels .
Yet , in our pain group alexithymic patients:__entity__ showed no significant difference from the nonalexithymics on trait anxiety .
Besides , alexithymia and anxiety were not correlated at all .
The reasons may be lying in the specific characteristics of this patient:__entity__ group itself .
The study included patients:__entity__ suffering from chronic symptoms ; with an average of 7 , 44 +/- 6 , 82 years of pain in the alexithymic and 3 , 31 +/- 2 , 79 years in the nonalexithymic groups .
Persistency of any physical symptom may bring along alexithymia as a coping strategy .
In their paper , Crook and Tunks ( 1988 ) examined the types of coping strategies used by persistent pain sufferers and addressed to the importance to alter their attitudes and behavior that tend toward catastrophizing , avoidance and withdrawal , rather than simply concentrate on trying to teach them techniques for ' coping with stress ' to help persistent pain sufferers [ 30 ] .
Sufferers of chronic symptoms in this sample were members of a subgroup who have been seeking medical care for a long time and besides given the chance of being referred to a psychiatrist .
Therefore , alexithymic or not , their anxiety might have induced unique coping strategies and illness behavior .
Alexithymia may be important in addressing the diversity of subjective factors involved in pain [ 31 ] .
It is not known whether it should be addressed in the treatment of pain patients:__entity__ , but a high level of alexithymia may effect the nature of assessment .
In summary , the conceptualization of alexithymia as a personality trait as well as a secondary state reaction is underlined by our data .
However , regarding the cross - sectional design of this study , only limited conclusions can be drawn about the nature of the causal relationship between alexithymia and chronic pain .
Therefore , future longitudinal studies assessing the cause of alexithymic characteristics are required to fully elucidate the concepts of primary and secondary alexithymia .
Molecular polymorphism , differentiation and introgression in the period gene between Lutzomyia:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ and Lutzomyia:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__
Abstract
Background
Lutzomyia:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ and Lutzomyia:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ ( Diptera : Psychodidae ) are important and very closely related vector species of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Brazil , which are distinguishable by a few morphological differences .
There is evidence of mitochondrial introgression between the two species but it is not clear whether gene flow also occurs in nuclear genes .
Results
We analyzed the molecular variation within the clock gene period ( per ) of these two species in five different localities in Eastern Brazil .
AMOVA and Fst estimates showed no evidence for geographical differentiation within species .
On the other hand , the values were highly significant for both analyses between species .
The two species show no fixed differences and a higher number of shared polymorphisms compared to exclusive mutations .
In addition , some haplotypes that are " typical " of one species were found in some individuals of the other species suggesting either the persistence of old polymorphisms or the occurrence of introgression .
Two tests of gene flow , one based on linkage disequilibrium and a MCMC analysis based on coalescence , suggest that the two species might be exchanging alleles at the per locus .
Conclusion
Introgression might be occurring between L:__entity__ .:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ and L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ in period , a gene controlling behavioral rhythms in Drosophila .
This result raises the question of whether similar phenomena are occurring at other loci controlling important aspects of behavior and vectorial capacity .
Background
The Phlebotominae sand flies Lutzomyia:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ Lutz & Neiva 1912 and Lutzomyia:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ Antunes & Coutinho 1912 are vectors of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Brazil .
These are closely related species that can be only distinguished by a few morphological differences [ 1 ] and both show high anthropophily and reported natural infections with Leishmania in different regions of Brazil [ 2 ] .
Despite their importance as vectors , only a handful of studies have been carried out in these two species using molecular techniques [ 3 - 6 ] .
One of the most important findings from an epidemiological perspective is the evidence obtained for introgression between the two species using mitochondrial DNA [ 4 ] .
This was particularly interesting because apparently , only lineages of L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ sympatric with L:__entity__ .:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ have been involved in cutaneous leishmaniasis transmission in the peridomestic environment [ 4 ] , which suggests that genes controlling aspects of vectorial capacity could be passing from one species to the other .
In fact , mitochondrial introgression has been reported in other sand fly species [ 7 , 8 ] suggesting that might be a common phenomenon in these insect vectors .
However , because mitochondrial genes can introgress relatively easily between closely related species [ 9 ] , it becomes important to examine whether introgression can occur with nuclear genes .
The Drosophila period ( per ) gene homologue was isolated in sand flies by Peixoto et al .
[ 10 ] .
This circadian clock gene was originally identified using mutagenesis by Konopka and Benzer [ 11 ] , but is also known to control the differences in the " lovesong " rhythms between D:__entity__ .:__entity__ melanogaster:__entity__ and D:__entity__ .:__entity__ simulans:__entity__ [ 12 ] , that are important to the sexual isolation between these two species [ 13 - 15 ] .
In addition , per was implicated in the control of species - specific circadian mating rhythms in Drosophila and Bractocera , which might also constitute a reproductive isolation mechanism [ 16 - 18 ] .
Thus per may possibly represent an example of a Drosophila speciation gene [ 19 ] , and in fact it has been used as a molecular marker in a number of speciation and evolutionary studies , not only in Drosophila ( reviewed in [ 20 ] ) but also in other insects ( e . g . [ 21 ] ) including sand flies [ 22 - 24 ] .
Because per controls the circadian clock in different insects [ 25 ] , it is almost certainly involved in the rhythms of activity and biting of sand flies [ 26 ] , which are very important to leishmaniasis transmission .
In addition , per might be involved in reproductive isolation in sand flies , via mating rhythms , or via their " lovesongs " [ 2 , 27 ] . per is thus a particularly interesting marker , among the few available , for an introgression analysis in L:__entity__ .:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ and L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ .
Evidence for introgression in per might suggest that gene flow between these two vector species is occurring at other genes controlling important aspects of behavior and vectorial capacity .
It might also suggest that per does not have a strong role in their reproductive isolation .
In the current study , we analyzed the molecular variation within the per gene of L:__entity__ .:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ and L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ in five different localities in Eastern Brazil .
Results
Polymorphism and divergence between L:__entity__ .:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ and L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__
A total of 68 sequences from L:__entity__ .:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ and 53 from L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ homologue to a fragment of the period gene were analyzed from populations of five localities in Eastern Brazil ( Fig 1 ) .
The alignment of 72 variable sites is shown in Fig 2 .
Although most of the changes are either synonymous or occur within the 58 bp intron , non - synonymous substitutions are observed causing 9 amino acid differences among the sequences ( Fig 2 ) .
Table 1 shows the number of sequences of each population of the two species , the number of polymorphic sites ( S ) and the estimates of molecular polymorphism theta ( based on the total number of mutations ) and pi .
Table 1 also shows the Tajima ' s [ 28 ] and Fu & Li ' s [ 29 ] statistics .
Within each species , all populations present similar levels of polymorphism with the exception of L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ from Ilh e us , which seems to be less polymorphic than the others .
This population was also the only one presenting a significant value in the Fu & Li test but only at the 5 % level .
Finally , the last column of Table 1 presents the recombination estimator gamma [ 30 ] indicating that both species show evidence of intragenic recombination in the per gene .
To investigate the level of intra and interspecific differences , initially an AMOVA was carried out as shown in Table 2 .
The results show a non - significant within species and a significant between species molecular variation at the per locus .
Table 3 shows a more detailed analysis of the intraspecific differentiation among populations of L:__entity__ .:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ and L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ .
None of the pairwise and overall fixation indexes ( Fst ) are significant in the case of L:__entity__ .:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ and only one ( Posse x Ilh e us ) has a borderline significant value in L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ .
The results therefore show that no significant geographical heterogeneity was detected among the populations of the two species .
The estimated number of migrants per generation , based on the overall Fst values , is 20 . 683 for L:__entity__ .:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ and 23 . 125 for L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ .
Table 4 shows measures for DNA divergence between species ( Dxy and Da ) , as well as the Fst and Nm values considering each species as a unique population .
Dxy is the average number of nucleotide substitutions per site between alleles from two different populations and Da is the number of net nucleotide substitutions between two populations .
Table 4 also shows the number of polymorphisms exclusive for each species ( Sint and Swhit ) , the number of shared polymorphisms ( Ss ) and the number of fixed differences ( Sf ) between species .
As one can note , there is a high number of shared polymorphisms between species , and no fixed differences between them suggesting either the persistence of ancestral polymorphisms or the occurrence of introgression .
In fact , there is one shared haplotype between the two species ( IPO13 , WPO10 and WPO19 ) and three L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ sequences ( WAC02 , WPO13 and WPO14 ) which show only one nucleotide difference to " typical " L:__entity__ .:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ haplotypes ( see also below ) .
Genealogy of period sequences
A phylogenetic analysis of the period gene sequences from L:__entity__ .:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ and L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ was carried out with the Minimum Evolution method using the Kimura 2 - parameter distance ( Fig 3 ) .
A sequence from L:__entity__ .:__entity__ umbratilis:__entity__ , a related species from the same subgenus Nyssomyia , was used as outgroup [ 24 ] .
The tree shows L:__entity__ .:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ and L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ as non - monophyletic .
However , despite the low bootstrap values , which are below 50 % in most cases , there is a large group that contains most L:__entity__ .:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ sequences and a second large group with most L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ sequences .
A few other sequences are clustered outside these two main groups .
It is interesting to note that there are three L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ alleles ( WAC2 , WPO13 and WPO14 ) inside L:__entity__ .:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ main group , as well as one L:__entity__ .:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ allele ( ICP16 ) inside the L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ main group .
In addition , a second L:__entity__ .:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ allele ( IPO13 ) is a shared haplotype between the two species as mentioned above .
Again , the results suggest either the persistence of ancestral polymorphisms or the occurrence of introgression between the two species .
Very similar results were obtained using the maximum likelihood algorithm as implemented in PAUP 4 . 0b10 software [ 31 ] ( data not shown ) .
As mentioned before , there is evidence of intragenic recombination in the per gene fragment of both species ( see Table 1 ) and for that reason the bifurcating tree shown in Fig 3 has to be viewed with caution , as different regions of the gene might have different phylogenetic histories [ 32 ] .
Therefore , we constructed Minimum Evolution trees with the two most polymorphic non - recombining blocks of the per gene fragment identified using the Hudson and Kaplan [ 33 ] method available in the DNAsp 4 . 1 program [ 34 ] .
We did not observed major changes in the genealogy of the L:__entity__ .:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ and L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ per sequences , especially regarding the five haplotypes ( ICP16 , IPO13 , WAC2 , WPO13 and WPO14 ) that clearly cluster with sequences of the other species ( data not shown ) .
Finally , a haplotype network was estimated from per sequences using statistical parsimony , as described by Templeton et al .
[ 35 ] and implemented in the TCS1 . 21 software [ 36 ] ( Fig 4 ) .
A small number of ambiguities were resolved as suggested by Crandall and Templeton [ 37 ] .
The haplotype network shows connections between sequences from each species , separating most of the sequences of L:__entity__ .:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ and L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ in two groups .
No intraspecific geographical structuring was found .
Once again , some of the L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ sequences ( WAC2 , WAC10 , WPO13 and WPO14 ) appear more closely related to L:__entity__ .:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ haplotypes .
In addition , one L:__entity__ .:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ allele ( ICP16 ) is connected by a small number of mutations to some of the main L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ haplotypes and IPO13 is a shared haplotype between the two species .
These results confirm the same putative introgressed sequences indicated by the phylogenetic reconstructions .
LD test of introgression
We tested the hypothesis of gene flow between L:__entity__ .:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ and L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ using a method based on linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) developed by Machado et al .
[ 38 ] .
In this test , x is the difference between the average LD found among all pairs of shared polymorphisms ( DSS ) between the two species and the average LD among all pairs of sites for which one member is a shared polymorphism and the other is an exclusive polymorphism ( DSX ) .
In case of gene flow x should tend to be positive [ see [ 38 ] for more details ] .
Because of limitations on the total number of sequences that could be handled by the WH program we could not perform the simulations with all sequences .
Therefore , we carried out the LD test of introgression between each pair of sympatric populations of L:__entity__ .:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ and L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ from the localities of Posse , Afonso Claudio and Corte de Pedra .
The input files were prepared using the values of recombination and linkage disequilibrium calculated by the SITES program [ 30 ] for each population ( data not shown ) .
Although no significant values were found for the smaller samples of Afonso Claudio and Corte de Pedra , the results ( Table 5 ) present evidence for introgression in the period gene in both directions ( from L:__entity__ .:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ to L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ and vice - versa ) in the locality of Posse .
Isolation with Migration model
To further examine the gene flow between L:__entity__ .:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ and L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ we used the IM software [ 39 ] .
The Isolation with Migration model has six demographic parameters that include two migration rates , one for each population .
The IM software estimates the posterior probability for each of the model parameters , fitting the Isolation with Migration model to the data .
One of the assumptions of this model is that the loci studied do not have internal recombination .
Therefore , we identified four different non - recombining blocks of our fragment of per , which were then treated as different loci in the analysis .
The four - gametes test [ 33 ] implemented in DnaSP4 . 1 was used for the identification of possible recombination events .
Since the program estimates parameters for a pair of closely related populations or species , all sequences of each species were used in the analysis as a single population .
We performed MCMC runs using the IM software with different seed numbers , in order to guarantee convergence of the sample .
Maximum likelihood estimates of migration parameters revealed a non - zero value for both species , m1 = 1 . 398 and m2 = 1 . 014 ( m1 - from L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ towards L:__entity__ .:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ ; m2 - from L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ towards L:__entity__ .:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ ) .
Fig 5 shows the posterior distributions for migration rates and reveals a null probability for the absence of migration from L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ towards L:__entity__ .:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ .
In addition , the absence of migration in the opposite direction is not included in the 95 % confidence interval ( values range from 0 . 222 to 8 . 898 ) , thus supporting the presence of migration in both directions .
The conversion of the migration rate estimate to population migration rate per generation ( m1 and m2 ) is not accurate when the population size is based on a single locus .
However , the average of the migrant number per generation for both species was very close to the Nm estimate based on Fst values ( Nm ~ 0 . 49 in Table 4 , m1 ~ 0 . 52 and m2 ~ 0 . 34 ) .
Discussion
There is some evidence that L:__entity__ .:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ and L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ might represent sibling - species complexes in Brazil .
Lutzomyia:__entity__ neivai:__entity__ Pinto 1926 , a sibling of L:__entity__ .:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ is found in parts of Southern and Western Brazil and some other countries of South America [ 40 ] .
The present study did not include populations of this species .
In the case of L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ , mitochondrial data [ 3 , 6 ] indicates three main lineages in Brazil : an Amazonian group , a North - South group and a Northeast group .
We did not find strong evidence of a geographical differentiation in the period gene among populations of L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ although one of the pairwise Fst comparisons ( Posse x Ilh e us ) was significant at the 5 % level .
When we compare L:__entity__ .:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ and L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ , we find a highly significant Fst value ( 0 . 3373 ) , which is however smaller than that observed for the period gene between sympatric siblings of Lutzomyia:__entity__ longipalpis:__entity__ ( Fst = 0 . 3952 ) [ 23 ] , a complex of cryptic species that are vectors of American visceral leishmaniasis .
Therefore , despite the presence of diagnostic morphological characters to identify L:__entity__ .:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ and L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ [ 1 ] the level of molecular divergence in period is not as high as the cryptic L:__entity__ .:__entity__ longipalpis:__entity__ siblings .
Even though it is hard to distinguish introgression from the persistence of ancestral polymorphisms , a test of gene flow based on the signature introgression leaves on the patterns of linkage disequilibrium [ 38 ] as well as simulations that fit the " Isolation with Migration " model to the data suggest that L:__entity__ .:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ and L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ might be exchanging alleles at the per locus .
This is further supported by the presence of shared haplotypes between the two species in Posse and very similar sequences in all sympatric populations .
There is mounting evidence that introgression plays a major role in the evolution of closely related insect vector species .
Introgression among vectors may have important epidemiological consequences .
Gene flow in loci that affect vectorial capacity , such as those controlling host preference and susceptibility to parasite infection , can change the transmission patterns and consequently make the disease control a harder task .
Introgression of genes that control adaptation to particular types of environment can also have a major impact on the spread of vector - borne diseases as was proposed for the major African malaria vector Anopheles:__entity__ gambiae:__entity__ [ 41 ] .
The same can be said about genes controlling insecticide resistance .
For example , Weill et al .
[ 42 ] found a kdr mutation responsible for pyrethroid resistance in the Mopti form of Anopheles:__entity__ gambiae:__entity__ , a normally susceptible taxon of this species complex .
Sequence analysis reveals that this resistant allele probably originates through introgression from the Savanna form .
Although L:__entity__ .:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ and L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ are closely related and only distinguished by a few morphological differences , they do show differentiation in some other important traits .
For example , in Posse , one of the localities we studied , the two species show differences in abundance during the year .
L:__entity__ .:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ is more abundant in the summer while L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ is more frequent in the winter months [ 2 ] .
They also show differences in microhabitat preferences , L:__entity__ .:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ being more common in the peridomestic area while L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ is found mainly in the surrounding forest [ 2 ] .
In addition , the two species show marked differences in their tendencies to bite humans:__entity__ in the early morning , with L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ showing higher feeding rates than L:__entity__ .:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ [ 26 ] .
Therefore , despite the evidence of introgression in the period gene in this locality , there are important ecological and behavioral differences between the two species in Posse suggesting that gene flow is probably rather limited in loci controlling these traits .
Hence , it is yet not clear whether introgression has played an important role in the evolution of L:__entity__ .:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ and L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ .
Further work with other genes might help clarify the issue .
Conclusion
Evidence for introgression between L:__entity__ .:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ and L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ obtained using mitochondrial DNA [ 4 ] seems to be corroborated by our data on the period gene , a nuclear marker .
Nevertheless , considering that period is potentially involved in reproductive isolation and might be , therefore , less prone to introgression than the " average " gene [ 43 ] , it is possible that much higher levels of gene flow between the two species occur at other genes .
It might , on the other hand , suggest that this behavioral gene , or at least the fragment we analyzed , did not play a role in speciation between L:__entity__ .:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ and L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ .
In fact the same has been suggested for some Drosophila species [ 44 ] despite per ' s role controlling lovesong and mating rhythm differences between D:__entity__ .:__entity__ melanogaster:__entity__ and D:__entity__ .:__entity__ simulans:__entity__ [ 13 - 16 ] .
Although the evidence for introgression in the per gene between L:__entity__ .:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ and L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ is not overwhelming , it does indicate the need to extend this analysis to other loci in the future .
We are currently isolating new molecular markers in the two species to carry out a multi - locus approach [ 39 ] that might help determining how much variation in gene flow and differentiation there is across the genome of these two very important leishmaniasis vectors .
Methods
Sand fly samples
Sand fly samples used in this work were all the F1 generation from wild collected females from the Brazilian localities of Posse ( Petr o polis , Rio de Janeiro State , 22 degrees 30 ' S 43 degrees 10 ' W ) , Jacarepagu a ( Rio de Janeiro , Rio de Janeiro State , 22 degrees 55 ' S 43 degrees 21 ' W ) , Afonso Claudio ( Esp i rito Santo State , 20 degrees 04 ' S 41 degrees 07 ' W ) , Corte de Pedra ( Presidente Tancredo Neves , Bahia State , 13 degrees 27 ' S 39 degrees 25 ' W ) and Ilh e us ( Bahia State , 14 degrees 50 ' S 39 degrees 06 ' W ) .
L:__entity__ .:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ and L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ were identified according to Young and Duncan [ 1 ] .
The progeny of each wild caught female was raised separately according to Souza et al .
[ 45 ] and only one F1 male of each female was used for the molecular analysis , which included 68 individuals of L:__entity__ .:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ ( 12 from Afonso Claudio , 18 from Posse , 20 from Corte de Pedra and 18 from Jacarepagu a ) and 51 individuals of L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ ( 12 from Afonso Claudio , 17 from Posse , 3 from Corte de Pedra and 19 from Ilh e us ) .
Note that , although the distribution of the two species shows considerable overlap in Eastern Brazil , in many localities only one species is found or is far more abundant than the other .
There are also seasonal and microhabitat differences in abundance between them in areas of sympatry [ 2 ] .
DNA methods
Genomic DNA was prepared according to Jowett [ 46 ] with slight modifications and the PCR was carried out for 30 cycles at 95 degrees C for 30 sec , 60 degrees C for 30 sec and 72 degrees C for 30 sec , using Abgene , Amersham Biosciences or Biotools reagents according to manufacturers directions .
The per primer sequences are : 5llper2 : 5 ' - AGCATCCTTTTGTAGCAAAC - 3 ' ( forward ) and 3llper2 : 5 ' - TCAGATGAACTCTTGCTGTC - 3 ' ( reverse ) .
These primers amplify a 486 bp fragment of the sand fly per gene homologue that includes part of the PAS / CLD domain , an intron ( 58 bp ) and the beginning of the perS domain [ 24 ] .
The amplified fragments were cloned using the pMOSBlue blunt ended cloning kit ( Amersham Biosciences ) and plasmid DNA preparation was carried out using the " Flexiprep " Kit ( Amersham Biosciences ) .
Cloned PCR fragments were sequenced at Funda c a o Oswaldo Cruz and at University of Leicester using ABI 377 sequencers .
With the exception of two L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ individuals from Corte de Pedra ( see below ) , only one sequence of each sand fly ( representing one of the two possible alleles ) was used in the analysis but an average of three sequences per individual were obtained in order to check possible PCR induced mutations .
In addition , PCR fragments were also sequenced directly in some cases for the same reason .
In the case of the two L:__entity__ .:__entity__ whitmani:__entity__ mentioned above 6 and 9 clones were sequenced respectively from specimens WCP01 and WCP03 to determine both alleles simply to increase the size of this small sample .
Negative controls were performed for all amplification reactions .
In addition , PCR , cloning and sequencing were repeated for two individuals to confirm putative introgressed sequences and to exclude the possibility that they were the result of PCR contamination .
Finally , for at least two individuals with putative introgressed sequences , we could define the other allele from additional clones ( not included in the analysis ) , which showed to be typical of the species , indicating no identification problems .
The sequences were submitted to GenBank ( accession numbers AY927062 to AY927182 ) .
Sequence analyses
The preliminary sequence editing was carried out using the Wisconsin Package Version 9 . 1 , Genetics Computer Group ( GCG ) , Madison , and ClustalX [ 47 ] was used to perform the multiple alignment .
Analyses of population polymorphisms and differentiation between populations were carried out using DNAsp4 . 1 [ 34 ] and ProSeq [ 48 ] softwares , while Arlequin v .
2 . 0 [ 49 ] was used for an analysis of molecular variance ( AMOVA ) between populations .
The Minimum Evolution phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA 3 . 1 software [ 50 ] .
The haplotype network was estimated using TCS1 . 21 [ 36 ] .
Recombination and linkage disequilibrium analyses were performed using the DNAsp4 . 1 and SITES program [ 30 ] .
Linkage disequilibrium simulations were carried out by the WH program [ 51 , 52 ] and Markov Chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) simulations of the isolation with migration model were performed using the algorithm implemented in the IM program [ 39 ] .

Presence of antibodies against cyclic citrullinated peptides in patients:__entity__ with ' rhupus ' : a cross - sectional study
Abstract
' Rhupus ' is a rare condition sharing features of rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) and systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) .
If rhupus is a distinctive entity , an overlap between RA and SLE or a subset of SLE is currently debated .
This study was performed to explore the prevalence of antibodies against cyclic citrullinated peptides ( anti - CCP antibodies ) in rhupus .
Patients:__entity__ meeting American College of Rheumatology criteria for RA , SLE , or both were included .
Clinical and radiographic features were recorded and sera were searched for anti - CCP antibodies , rheumatoid factor , antinuclear antibodies , anti - extractable nuclear antigens , and antibodies against double - stranded DNA ( anti - dsDNA antibodies ) .
Seven patients:__entity__ for each group were included .
Clinical and serological features for RA or SLE were similar between rhupus and RA patients:__entity__ , and between rhupus and SLE patients:__entity__ , respectively .
Values for anti - CCP antibodies obtained were significantly ( p < 0 . 05 ) higher in RA ( 6 / 7 ) and rhupus ( 4 / 7 ) than in SLE patients:__entity__ ( 0 / 7 ) and healthy subjects ( 0 / 7 ) .
Our data support the possibility that rhupus is an overlap between RA and SLE , because highly specific autoantibodies for RA ( anti - CCP ) and for SLE ( anti - dsDNA and anti - Sm ) are detected in coexistence .
Introduction
The clinical coexistence of rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) and systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) was first described in 1969 by Kantor and was termed ' rhupus syndrome ' by Schur ( both cited in [ 1 ] ) .
Since then , fewer than 100 cases of rhupus have been published [ 1 - 3 ] .
In an epidemiological study including about 7 , 000 new patients:__entity__ , the prevalence of RA was 15 % and for SLE it was 8 . 9 % .
The expected coincidence of RA and SLE by chance would therefore be 1 . 2 % .
However , the observed prevalence of rhupus was 0 . 09 % , less than one - tenth of that expected [ 1 ] .
Previous reports have shown that the patients:__entity__ with rhupus display an array of autoantibodies including anti - double - stranded DNA ( anti - dsDNA ) , anti - Sm ( both highly specific for SLE ) , anti - SSA , anti - SSB , anti - ribonucleoprotein , antinuclear antibodies ( ANA ) , anti - cardiolipins , and rheumatoid factor ( RF ) [ 1 , 2 ] .
However , no study has yet been performed to investigate the presence of antibodies against cyclic citrullinated peptides ( anti - CCP antibodies ) , which have a specificity for RA of 96 to 98 % ( for second - generation assays ( anti - CCP2 ) ) [ 4 , 5 ] .
Recent data have confirmed that these antibodies are rarely if ever present in other autoimmune diseases such as SLE , Sj o gren ' s syndrome ( SS ) , scleroderma and myositis [ 6 ] .
Nowadays , it is a matter of debate whether rhupus is a clinically and immunologically distinctive entity [ 2 ] , a true overlap between SLE and RA [ 7 ] , or a subgroup of patients:__entity__ with lupus [ 8 ] .
This descriptive , cross - sectional study was performed to investigate the frequency of anti - CCP antibodies in a cohort of patients:__entity__ with rhupus .
Materials and methods
We included all patients:__entity__ fulfilling American College of Rheumatology ( ACR ) classification criteria for both RA [ 9 ] and SLE [ 10 ] who belonged to our cohorts of patients:__entity__ with RA and with SLE .
Comparisons were made with age - and gender - matched patients:__entity__ with RA and with SLE , and healthy subjects .
The study was approved by the local ethics committee , and informed consent was obtained .
Serum samples were obtained and stored at - 75 degrees C until use .
Sera were analyzed for anti - CCP2 antibodies by ELISA ( Inova Diagnostics , San Diego , CA , USA ) with a cutoff value of 60 U / ml .
Fine antinuclear reactivities ( ELISA ; Inova Diagnostics ) , RF ( nephelometry ) , ANA ( indirect immunofluorescence on HEp - 2 slides ) , and anti - dsDNA ( indirect immunofluorescence on Crithidia luciliae substrate ) antibodies were also determined .
Except for healthy individuals , standard radiographs of hands were available .
For statistical analysis , ANOVA and the Mann - Whitney U test were performed as appropriate with GraphPad Prism 4 . 0 software ( GraphPad Inc , San Diego , CA , USA ) .
Results
Seven female patients:__entity__ with a median age of 44 years ( range 25 to 64 ) met our inclusion criteria .
The major clinical and laboratory findings are presented in Table 1 .
Healthy individuals and all patients:__entity__ belonged to cohorts from the same ethnic group ( Hispanic mestizo ) .
No differences in demographic data were found between groups .
Mean ACR criteria for SLE were 5 . 57 ( range 4 to 8 ) in the SLE group , and 5 . 57 ( 4 to 8 ) in the rhupus group .
In the same way , mean ACR criteria for RA were 6 ( 4 to 7 ) in the RA group , and 5 . 14 ( 4 to 6 ) for the patients:__entity__ with rhupus .
In all patients:__entity__ with rhupus , RA was presented as the initial disease , as has been described previously [ 2 ] .
In accordance with another report , in two patients:__entity__ the disease started during their childhood as juvenile chronic arthritis [ 1 ] .
Anti - CCP antibodies were found in four of seven ( 57 % ) patients:__entity__ with rhupus , and in six of seven ( 86 % ) patients:__entity__ with RA , whereas neither patients:__entity__ with SLE nor healthy individuals showed reactivity .
When the concentrations in each group were compared , a statistical significant difference between groups was found ( ANOVA , p < 0 . 05 ) .
The mean concentration of anti - CCP antibodies was 584 U / ml ( range 0 to 1 , 237 ) in patients:__entity__ with rhupus ( Figure 1 ) , 875 U / ml ( 0 to 1 , 178 ) in the RA group ( not significant compared with rhupus ) , 1 U / ml ( 0 to 10 ) for SLE individuals ( p < 0 . 05 compared with rhupus ) , and 0 U / ml ( 0 to 2 ) for healthy controls ( p < 0 . 05 compared with rhupus ) .
Two of three patients:__entity__ with rhupus who were negative for anti - CCP antibodies were also negative for anti - dsDNA antibodies , RF and anti - extractable nuclear antigen antibodies , although both patients:__entity__ met RA and SLE classification criteria , including ANA and erosive arthritis .
Differences in ANA , anti - dsDNA and anti - extractable nuclear antigen autoantibodies between patients:__entity__ with rhupus and those with SLE were not found .
We also found no difference in the prevalence of RF between patients:__entity__ with rhupus and those with RA .
Surprisingly , one healthy subject was positive for RF , ANA and anti - SSA antibodies , although she was asymptomatic and no features of any disease were found .
Discussion
The close association between different type II human:__entity__ leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) molecules and the risk of RA is well established .
These major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II molecules share the same amino acid sequence ( QKRAA or QRRAA ) in positions 69 to 74 of the beta - chain , namely the ' shared epitope ' .
Recent works have demonstrated that this ' shared epitope ' preferentially binds peptides containing the non - standard amino acid citrulline ( deiminated arginine ) [ 11 ] .
In addition , an abnormally increased function of the enzyme peptidylarginine deiminase 4 ( PAD4 ; responsible for the deimination of arginine ) and an elevated anti - CCP autoantibody production in patients:__entity__ with RA have been demonstrated [ 12 ] .
These facts have built the first bridge between cellular and humoral autoimmunity in a major rheumatic disease , supporting a pathogenetic role for an abnormal metabolism of citrulline in the development of RA [ 13 , 14 ] .
Patients:__entity__ with SLE are often part of the control group when determining the specificity of anti - CCP antibodies for RA [ 15 ] , although some studies have been performed specifically on patients:__entity__ with SLE .
These studies contribute some clues to the role of anti - CCP antibodies in rhupus .
Mediwake and colleagues [ 16 ] , in a study exploring the predictive value of anti - CCP antibodies to distinguish erosive arthritis in SLE , found ten patients:__entity__ ( out of 231 ) with erosive arthritis , two of whom had anti - CCP antibodies .
In concord with this , Hoffman and colleagues [ 15 ] demonstrate that three patients:__entity__ with erosive arthritis , included in a cohort of 235 patients:__entity__ with SLE , were positive for anti - CCP antibodies .
These authors suggest that the presence of anti - CCP antibodies can predispose for a chronic RA - like arthritis in patients:__entity__ with SLE .
Additionally Weissman and colleagues [ 17 ] demonstrated that patients:__entity__ with SLE can display radiographic abnormalities similar to those of RA , although the presence of marginal erosions is a rare finding .
In the present study we demonstrate that the patients:__entity__ with rhupus show a very similar arthritis pattern ( including erosive disease ) and similar autoantibody production ( RF and anti - CCP antibodies ) to those in patients:__entity__ with RA .
In addition , patients:__entity__ with rhupus display a clinical and serological profile indistinguishable from patients:__entity__ with SLE .
Moreover , the presence of other coexistent autoimmune diseases was similar in all groups of patients:__entity__ ( two patients:__entity__ with rhupus , three patients:__entity__ with RA , and three patients:__entity__ with SLE also had SS ) .
We found high titers of anti - CCP antibodies in four of seven ( 57 % ) patients:__entity__ with rhupus , a frequency similar to that reported for RA [ 4 ] .
This finding , together with the clinical similarity , supports the contention that rhupus belongs to the RA spectrum .
The high prevalence of anti - CCP antibodies in RA found in our study could be explained by a selection bias because only patients:__entity__ with RA with an aggressive disease ( namely erosive arthritis and RF + ) were included .
In contrast , the mean ACR criterion for SLE was similar between patients:__entity__ with rhupus and those with SLE , including the ' robust ' features of SLE such as renal and neurological involvement , and anti - dsDNA and anti - Sm antibodies .
These clinical and serological features shared between patients:__entity__ with rhupus and those with SLE also place rhupus in the SLE spectrum .
Titration of anti - CCP antibodies in the rhupus group clearly shows a bimodal distribution , suggesting the existence of two different subpopulations .
Because of the small number of patients:__entity__ , we are unable to define the differential features underlying each subset .
However , two of three patients:__entity__ negative for anti - CCP antibodies were also negative for both RF and anti - dsDNA antibodies .
Conclusion
On the basis of the presence of shared clinical features of RA ( mainly erosive arthritis ) and SLE ( including renal and neurological involvement ) along with the presence of anti - dsDNA and anti - CCP autoantibodies in our patients:__entity__ with rhupus , our findings strongly support the contention that rhupus is a true overlap between RA and SLE , not merely a part of the clinical spectrum of the articular involvement seen in SLE .
Moreover , on the basis of the mean ACR criteria for both diseases , we have confirmed that patients:__entity__ with rhupus have more RA - associated and less SLE - associated damage , an issue that has been suggested previously [ 2 ] .
To our knowledge , this is the first report exploring the prevalence of anti - CCP antibodies specifically in patients:__entity__ with rhupus .
More studies are needed to expand the pathogenetic knowledge of this overlap syndrome .

Identification of a human:__entity__ peripheral blood monocyte subset that differentiates into osteoclasts
Abstract
Increased bone resorption mediated by osteoclasts causes various diseases such as osteoporosis and bone erosion in rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) .
Osteoclasts are derived from the monocyte / macrophage lineage , but the precise origin remains unclear .
In the present study , we show that the purified CD16 - human:__entity__ peripheral blood monocyte subset , but not the CD16 + monocyte subset , differentiates into osteoclast by stimulation with receptor activator of NF - kappa B ligand ( RANKL ) in combination with macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( M - CSF ) .
Integrin - beta 3 mRNA and the integrin - alpha v beta 3 heterodimer were only expressed on CD16 - monocytes , when they were stimulated with RANKL + M - CSF .
Downregulation of beta 3 - subunit expression by small interfering RNA targeting beta 3 abrogated osteoclastogenesis from the CD16 - monocyte subset .
In contrast , the CD16 + monocyte subset expressed larger amounts of tumor necrosis factor alpha and IL - 6 than the CD16 - subset , which was further enhanced by RANKL stimulation .
Examination of RA synovial tissue showed accumulation of both CD16 + and CD16 - macrophages .
Our results suggest that peripheral blood monocytes consist of two functionally heterogeneous subsets with distinct responses to RANKL .
Osteoclasts seem to originate from CD16 - monocytes , and integrin beta 3 is necessary for osteoclastogenesis .
Blockade of accumulation and activation of CD16 - monocytes could therefore be a beneficial approach as an anti - bone resorptive therapy , especially for RA .
Introduction
Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation and proliferation of the synovium in multiple joints .
A large number of inflammatory cells , including T cells , B cells , macrophages and dendritic cells , accumulate in the affected synovium , and these inflammatory cells , together with fibroblast - like synoviocytes , express various cytokines , such as tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF alpha ) , IL - 6 and receptor activator of NF - kappa B ligand ( RANKL ) , which are known to induce differentiation and activation of osteoclasts .
The inflammatory synovial tissue , known as pannus , invades the articular bone and causes focal bone erosion , which is the hallmark of RA .
Histopathologically , osteoclasts are present at the interface of the pannus and bone .
Interestingly , the deletion of RANKL or c - Fos gene , which is important for osteoclastogenesis , results in minimal bone destruction in mouse:__entity__ models of arthritis [ 1 , 2 ] .
Furthermore , other studies indicated that inhibition of osteoclastogenesis by osteoprotegerin , a decoy receptor for RANKL , limits bone destruction in experimental models of arthritis .
These studies suggest that osteoclasts are involved in focal bone erosion in RA [ 3 ] .
Osteoclasts are derived from the monocyte / macrophage lineage .
It is reported that osteoclast precursors reside in human:__entity__ peripheral blood monocytes [ 4 , 5 ] .
A marked increase of the circulating osteoclast precursors was demonstrated in patients:__entity__ with erosive psoriatic arthritis as well as in arthritic TNF alpha transgenic mice:__entity__ [ 6 , 7 ] .
It was also shown that peripheral monocytes differentiate into osteoclasts when seeded on RANKL / osteoclast differentiation factor - producing RA synovial fibroblasts [ 8 ] .
In addition , RA synovial macrophages thought to originate from peripheral blood monocytes were shown to differentiate into osteoclasts [ 9 , 10 ] .
Monocytes are therefore involved not only in synovial inflammation , but also in bone remodeling as potential precursors for synovial macrophages and osteoclasts .
Human:__entity__ peripheral blood monocytes consist of two major subsets , CD16 + and CD16 - , comprising 5 - 10 % and 90 - 95 % of the monocytes , respectively .
These two subsets exhibit different chemotaxis activities and potential of cytokine production [ 11 , 12 ] .
Moreover , activation of the Toll - like receptor induces distinct subsets , CD1b + dendritic cells and DC - SIGN + ( dendritic cell - specific C - type lectin ICAM - 3 - grabbing nonintegrin ) macrophages from CD16 + and CD16 - monocytes , respectively [ 13 ] .
It has not been revealed , however , which monocyte subset develops into osteoclasts .
In the present study , we determined the human:__entity__ peripheral blood monocyte subset that differentiates into osteoclasts , and revealed that each subset exhibits a different response for osteoclastogenic stimuli .
Materials and methods
Purification of peripheral blood monocytes
Peripheral blood monocytes from healthy donors were collected using Ficoll - Conray ( Imuuno - Biological Laboratories , Gunma , Japan ) gradient centrifugation .
Negative selection of monocytes was performed using MACS microbeads ( Miltenyi Biotec , Auburn , CA , USA ) according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer .
The purified monocytes were separated into two subsets , CD16 + and CD16 - monocytes , using CD16 MicroBeads ( Miltenyi Biotec ) .
Flow cytometry analysis using FITC - conjugated mouse:__entity__ anti - CD14 mAb ( MY4 ; Bechman Coulter , Fullerton , CA , USA ) and phycoerythin - conjugated mouse:__entity__ anti - CD16 mAb ( 3G8 ; BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA , USA ) showed that the purities of the CD16 + and CD16 - monocytes were more than 90 % and 92 % , respectively .
For the other experiment , monocytes were purified using CD14 MicroBeads ( Miltenyi Biotec ) , and then stained either with FITC - conjugated mouse:__entity__ anti - CD33 mAb ( MY9 ; Bechman Coulter ) or phycoerythin - conjugated mouse:__entity__ anti - CD16 mAb ( 3G8 ) .
Cell sorting of the stained cells was performed using a FACS Vantage cytometer ( BD Biosciences ) or a MoFlo cell sorter ( Dako , Glostrup , Denmark ) .
Osteoclast differentiation
Purified CD16 + and CD16 - monocytes ( 5 x 104 cells / well ) were incubated in 96 - well plates in alpha MEM ( Sigma , St Louis , MO , USA ) with heat - inactivated 10 % fetal bovine:__entity__ serum ( FBS ) ( Sigma ) or with Ultra - Low IgG FBS ( IgG < 5 mu g / ml ; Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) , and where indicated with M - CSF + RANKL ( Peprotech , Rocky Hill , NJ , USA ) .
For the other experiments , varied numbers of CD16 + monocytes ( 1 x 103 , 2 . 5 x 103 , 5 x 103 ) were mixed with CD16 - monocytes ( 5 x 104 cells / well ) , and were cultured in 96 - well plates in alpha MEM with heat - inactivated 10 % FBS .
The medium was replaced with fresh medium 3 days later , and after incubation for 7 days the cells were stained for tartrate - resistant acid phosphatase ( TRAP ) expression using a commercial kit ( Hokudo , Sapporo , Japan ) .
The number of TRAP - positive multinucleated cells ( MNC ) in three randomly selected fields examined at 100 x magnification or the total number of TRAP - positive MNC per well was counted under light microscopy .

The PCR conditions were 25 - 40 cycles of denaturation ( 95 degrees C for 30 s ) , annealing ( 60 - 62 degrees C for 1 min ) and extension ( 72 degrees C for 1 min ) .
The sequences of the primers are presented in Table 1 .
The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis through 2 % agarose gel .
Western immunoblot analysis
Purified monocytes were cultured for 3 days in the presence of 40 ng / ml M - CSF with or without 25 ng / ml RANKL .
Cells were lysed in RIPA Lysis buffer ( upstate , Lake Placid , NY , USA ) containing protease inhibitors ( Roche ) for 15 min at 4 degrees C .
A total of 20 mu g protein was boiled in the presence of 6 x sodium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer , and was separated on 7 . 5 % or 10 % sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel ( ATTO , Tokyo , Japan ) .
Proteins were then electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride microporous membrane ( Millipore , Billerica , MA , USA ) in a semidry system .
Membranes were incubated in 10 % skim milk prepared in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) containing 0 . 1 % Tween 20 , and were subjected to immunoblotting .

The stained cells were analyzed with a FACS Calibur ( BD Biosciences ) .
Immunofluorescent staining
Monocytes ( 8 x 104 cells / well ) were allowed to adhere on 96 - well plates overnight or were cultured with M - CSF and RANKL for 2 - 4 days .
The cells were fixed in acetone and then stained with anti - alpha v beta 3 mAb ( LM609 ; Chemicon , Temecula , CA , USA ) or mouse:__entity__ IgG1 ( 11711 ; R & D Systems ) as an isotype - matched control .
Alexa fluor546 - conjugated goat:__entity__ anti - mouse:__entity__ IgG1 antibody ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR , USA ) was used as the second antibody .

Purified monocytes were cultured in the presence of 25 ng / ml M - CSF for 3 days , and were either left unstimulated or were stimulated with 40 ng / ml RANKL at 37 degrees C .
Stimulations were stopped by adding an equal volume of PhosFlow Fix Buffer I solution ( BD Biosciences ) to the cell culture .
After incubation for 10 minutes at 37 degrees C , the cells were permeabilized by washing twice at room temperature in PhosFlow Perm / Wash Buffer I ( BD Biosciences ) .

Results
Induction of osteoclasts from CD16 - peripheral blood monocytes
To identify the monocyte subset that differentiates into osteoclasts , we examined osteoclast formation from CD16 + and CD16 - human:__entity__ peripheral blood monocytes .
The monocyte subsets were purified using magnetic beads .
Incubation with M - CSF alone did not induce osteoclast formation from either subset ( Figure 1a ) .
Culture with M - CSF + RANKL induced a significant number of TRAP - positive MNC from the CD16 - subset , whereas only few CD16 + monocytes differentiated into TRAP - positive MNC ( Figure 1a , b ) .
We then assessed the bone resorptive ability by culturing cells on calcium phosphate - coated plates with M - CSF + RANKL .
Resorption lacunae were detected only in the CD16 - subset ( Figure 1c ) , indicating the TRAP - positive CD16 - - derived MNC possessed the osteoclast phenotype .
Similar results were obtained using purified monocytes by FACS sorting ( purities : CD16 + , 96 % ; CD16 - , 97 % ) .
The number of TRAP - positive MNC induced were 36 +/- 3 cells / well and 348 +/- 13 cells / well from CD16 + and CD16 - monocytes , respectively .
To exclude the possibility that the anti - CD16 antibody used for isolation of CD16 + monocytes inhibits osteoclast formation , we separated the two subsets , CD33low monocytes and CD33high monocytes , using anti - CD33 mAb and a fluorescent cell sorter , since it was reported that CD33low monocytes correspond to CD16 + , and that CD33high correspond to CD16 - monocytes [ 15 ] .
On average , the CD33low population contained CD16 - ( 10 . 2 % ) / CD16 + ( 89 . 8 % ) monocytes , and the CD33high population contained CD16 - ( 86 . 3 % ) / CD16 + ( 13 . 7 % ) monocytes .
Culture with M - CSF + RANKL induced TRAP - positive MNC from CD33high monocytes , whereas no or few CD33low monocytes differentiated into TRAP - positive MNC ( CD33low vs CD33high , 2 +/- 1 vs 192 +/- 71 cells / well ; n = 3 ) .
TRAP - 5b and MMP - 9 in the culture supernatants , both of which are known to be produced by osteoclasts , were measured by ELISA .
The concentrations of both enzymes were significantly higher in the culture supernatant of CD16 - monocytes than in that of CD16 + monocytes ( Figure 1d ) .
These results suggest that the CD16 - peripheral blood monocyte subset , but not the CD16 + subset , differentiate into osteoclasts by incubation with RANKL + M - CSF .
CD16 + monocytes do not affect the osteoclastogenesis from CD16 - monocytes
To examine whether CD16 + monocytes affect osteoclastogenesis from CD16 - monocytes , varied numbers of CD16 + monocytes were mixed with CD16 - monocytes ( 5 x 104 cells / well ) , and were cultured for 7 days in the presence of M - CSF + RANKL .
The number of TRAP - positive MNC was not altered by the presence of CD16 + monocytes ( Figure 2 ) .
The results indicated that CD16 + monocytes did not hamper or enhance the osteoclastogenesis from CD16 - monocytes .
Differences in cytokine production by RANKL - stimulated or M - CSF - stimulated CD16 + and CD16 - monocytes
To compare the biological response of CD16 + and CD16 - subsets with either RANKL or M - CSF stimulation , we measured the amount of TNF alpha and IL - 6 production after exposure of cells to various concentrations of RANKL or M - CSF with an ELISA .
Without RANKL the CD16 + subset produced a significant amount of TNF alpha and IL - 6 , whereas the CD16 - subset produced undetectable levels ( Figure 3a ) .
RANKL stimulation increased TNF alpha production from both subsets in a dose - dependent manner , although the CD16 + subset produced more TNF alpha than did the CD16 - subset .
RANKL stimulation also enhanced IL - 6 production from the CD16 + subset , but not from the CD16 - subset .
M - CSF stimulation increased TNF alpha and IL - 6 production from both subsets , although the CD16 + subset produced more than the CD16 - subset ( Figure 3b ) .
These results suggest that CD16 + monocytes also respond both to RANKL and M - CSF stimulation , although such stimulation does not result in differentiation into osteoclasts .
CD16 + monocytes were also noted to express higher amounts of inflammatory cytokines compared with CD16 - monocytes with or without RANKL or M - CSF stimulation .
Comparison of expression levels of molecules involved in osteoclastogenesis between CD16 + and CD16 - monocytes
Diverse molecules are involved in RANKL / RANK and its costimulatory signal transduction pathways [ 16 ] .
The different response to RANKL + M - CSF stimulation between the CD16 + monocyte subset and the CD16 - monocytes subset might be explained by the expression profiles of these molecules .
We therefore examined the mRNA levels of the following molecules : receptor activator of NF - kappa B ( RANK ) , the receptor for RANKL ; c - fms , the receptor for M - CSF ; tumor necrosis factor receptor - associated factor 6 ( TRAF - 6 ) , the adaptor protein for RANK ; c - Fos and nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 ( NFATc1 ) , transcription factors that are essential for osteoclastogenesis ; DNAX - activation protein 12 ( DAP12 ) and Fc receptor gamma chain ( FcR gamma ) , adaptor proteins known to deliver costimulatory signals in RANKL - induced osteoclastogenesis ; signal regulatory protein beta 1 ( SIRP - beta 1 ) , triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 ( TREM - 2 ) and osteoclast - associated receptor ( OSCAR ) , transmembrane receptors that associate with either DAP12 or FcR gamma ; and alpha v and beta 3 , integrins known to be expressed as the alpha v beta 3 heterodimer on osteoclasts .
The mRNA levels of RANK , c - fms , TRAF - 6 , DAP12 and SIRP - beta 1 under the baseline condition ( no stimulation ) varied between the donors ; however , we did not find consistent differences in the mRNA levels of these molecules between the CD16 + monocyte subset and the CD16 - monocyte subset among three to six donors ( Figure 4a ) .
The mRNA levels of other molecules , apart from integrin beta 3 , were similar between the two subsets under the no - stimulation condition .
Although the mRNA levels of RANK , c - fms , DAP12 , FcR gamma , TREM - 2 and OSCAR increased in response to M - CSF alone or M - CSF + RANKL in both subsets , the expression levels were not significantly different between the two subsets .
Expressions of TRAF - 6 , c - Fos and SIRP - beta 1 mRNA did not change following stimulation with M - CSF + RANKL .
Of note , the expression of NFATc1 mRNA was enhanced by M - CSF + RANKL treatment only in the CD16 - subset .
Furthermore , expression of integrin alpha v in both subsets was enhanced by M - CSF with or without RANKL ; however , the expression level was greater in the CD16 - subset .
It was noted that integrin - beta 3 mRNA was detected only in the CD16 - subset and was increased by M - CSF + RANKL stimulation , but not by M - CSF alone .
The protein expression of RANK under the baseline condition was weakly detected in both subsets , and the levels were varied between donors by western immunoblotting .
The protein expression of c - fms was weakly detected in unstimulated CD16 + monocytes , but not in CD16 - monocytes ( Figure 4b ) .
Flow cytometry analysis of c - fms in fresh monocytes , however , showed that both subsets express the molecule on the cell surface ( Figure 4c ) .
Expressions of both RANK and c - fms were upregulated by M - CSF alone and by M - CSF + RANKL , and we did not find consistent differences in the protein levels of these molecules between the two monocyte subsets .
The profiles of expression levels of molecules involved in RANKL / RANK and its costimulatory pathways are similar between the two subsets , except for NFATc1 , integrin alpha v and integrin beta 3 .
We therefore assumed that the distinct induction of NFATc1 , integrin alpha v and integrin beta 3 in response to RANKL stimulation among the two monocyte subsets might explain the differences in their abilities to differentiate into osteoclasts .
RANKL stimulation induces alpha v beta 3 expression on CD16 - monocytes
The integrin - beta 3 subunit binds to integrin alpha v only and is expressed as the heterodimeric protein alpha v beta 3 on monocytes and osteoclasts [ 17 ] .
We examined the expression of alpha v beta 3 on CD16 + and CD16 - monocytes by immunofluorescent staining .
Neither unstimulated nor M - CSF - stimulated monocyte subsets expressed alpha v beta 3 ( Figure 4d and data not shown ) .
After 48 and 72 hours of treatment with M - CSF + RANKL , alpha v beta 3 - positive mononuclear cells were observed in CD16 - monocyte cultures but not in CD16 + monocyte cultures .
At 96 hours , both alpha v beta 3 - positive mononuclear cells and multinucleated cells were present in the CD16 - monocyte culture .
The results indicated that alpha v beta 3 was selectively expressed on CD16 - monocytes in the presence of M - CSF + RANKL , and the expression was revealed before the cells differentiate into typical multinucleated osteoclasts .
RANKL activates ERK and p38 kinases only in CD16 - monocytes
Since ERK and p38 MAPK are essential in RANKL - induced osteoclastogenesis [ 18 - 20 ] , we next examined whether these kinases were activated differently in CD16 + monocytes and in CD16 - monocytes .
Purified monocytes were precultured with 25 ng / ml M - CSF for 3 days to enhance RANK expression , and were then treated with RANKL .
The RANKL treatment induced phosphorylation of both ERK and p38 MAPK in CD16 - monocytes at 5 minutes postexposure , although the p38 MAPK phosphorylation was weak .
Both phosphorylations declined to a basal level within 20 minutes ( Figure 5 ) .
In contrast , ERK and p38 MAPK were not detectably phosphorylated in CD16 + monocytes with RANKL .
siRNA targeting integrin beta 3 inhibits osteoclastogenesis from CD16 - monocytes
The integrin - beta 3 cytoplasmic domain is essential for activation of intracellular signals from alpha v beta 3 heterodimers [ 17 ] .
We therefore examined the involvement of alpha v beta 3 in RANKL + M - CSF - induced osteoclastogenesis in human:__entity__ CD16 - monocytes using siRNA targeting the integrin - beta 3 subunit .
The integrin - beta 3 siRNA or control randomized siRNA were transfected into CD16 - monocytes .
At 48 hours post - transfection , we determined the integrin - beta 3 mRNA level and alpha v beta 3 heterodimer protein expression .
The integrin - beta 3 mRNA level was reduced in the integrin - beta 3 siRNA - transfected monocytes compared with control siRNA - transfected monocytes ( Figure 6a ) .
The alpha v beta 3 heterodimer expression was evaluated by immunofluorescent staining .
The number of alpha v beta 3 - positive cells was significantly decreased in integrin - beta 3 siRNA - transfected monocytes compared with that in control siRNA ( Figure 6b ) .
After 7 days of incubation , the number of TRAP - positive MNC was counted .
Transfection with integrin - beta 3 siRNA significantly reduced the number of TRAP - positive MNC in a dose - dependent manner compared with control siRNA transfection ( Figure 6c ) .
In addition , the use of siRNA directed toward a different site of integrin - beta 3 mRNA also inhibited osteoclast formation from CD16 - monocytes ( data not shown ) .
On the other hand , siRNA that targeted lamin , which was used as a negative control , did not inhibit the induction of osteoclasts ( data not shown ) .
These results indicate the importance of integrin beta 3 in RANKL - induced osteoclast formation from CD16 - peripheral blood monocytes .
Cyclic RGDfV peptide inhibits the osteoclastogenesis from CD16 - monocytes
Integrin alpha v beta 3 recognizes a common tripeptide sequence , RGD ( Arg - Gly - Asp ) , which is present in bone matrix proteins such as vitronectin and fibronectin [ 21 ] .
Cyclic RGDfV peptide ( Arg - Gly - Asp - D - Phe - Val ) inhibits binding of the RGD - containing molecules to alpha v beta 3 [ 22 ] .
To investigate the role of ligand binding to the alpha v beta 3 heterodimer in the osteoclastogenesis , we examined whether cyclic RGDfV peptide inhibits the formation of osteoclasts .
Cyclic RGDfV peptide significantly reduced the number of TRAP - positive MNC in a dose - dependent manner ( Figure 6d ) .
The results imply possible involvement of ligand bindings to alpha v beta 3 in the osteoclastogenesis .
Knockdown of integrin beta 3 did not affect the expression of NFATc1 mRNA
In the next step , we determined whether integrin - beta 3 - siRNA - induced inhibition of the osteoclastogenesis reflects downregulation of NFATc1 , which is a key transcription factor in osteoclastogenesis [ 23 ] .
For this purpose , we compared NFATc1 mRNA levels between integrin beta 3 and control siRNA - transfected monocytes .
Interestingly , integrin - beta 3 knockdown did not alter the NFATc1 mRNA level ( Figure 7 ) , suggesting that signal transduction mediated by integrin beta 3 does not affect the expression of NFATc1 .
Detection of CD16 + and CD16 - macrophages in synovium of RA patients:__entity__
RA synovial macrophages are derived from peripheral blood monocytes , and their recruitment into the synovium is facilitated by various adhesion molecules and chemokines [ 24 ] .
To analyze CD16 expression on synovial macrophages , RA synovial tissues were double - stained for CD16 and a macrophage marker , CD68 .
CD16 - / CD68 + macrophages were widespread in the synovium .
Although less frequent , CD16 + / CD68 + macrophages were also observed both in the synovial intima and subintima ( Figure 8 ) .
The presence of two subsets of macrophages , CD16 + and CD16 - , in RA synovium indicates that both CD16 + and CD16 - peripheral blood monocytes are recruited into the synovium .
Discussion
Human:__entity__ peripheral blood monocytes are a heterogeneous population , and they are divided into two subsets based on the expression of CD16 .
The CD16 + and CD16 - monocyte subsets show functional differences in migration , cytokine production and differentiation into macrophages or dendritic cells [ 11 - 13 , 15 ] .
We focused on the heterogeneity of the monocytes , and the primary question addressed in this study was which monocyte subset could be the source of osteoclasts .
The results demonstrated that CD16 - peripheral blood monocytes , but not CD16 + monocytes , differentiated in vitro into osteoclasts by treatment with RANKL + M - CSF .
To investigate the molecular mechanisms of the different response to RANKL and the differentiation into osteoclasts between CD16 + and CD16 - monocytes , we examined the expression of molecules known to be involved in osteoclastogenesis .
The expression profiles of integrin alpha v , integrin beta 3 and NFATc1 were different between the two subsets .
Integrin alpha v beta 3 heterodimer was expressed only on RANKL and M - CSF - stimulated CD16 - monocytes .
It is known that alpha v beta 3 expressed on osteoclasts is important in bone resorption as well as in attachment of osteoclasts to the bone matrix [ 25 ] .
It was recently reported that bone marrow macrophages of integrin - beta 3 - deficient mice:__entity__ could not differentiate into mature osteoclasts in vitro , suggesting that alpha v beta 3 is involved not only in activation , but also in differentiation , of osteoclasts in mice:__entity__ [ 26 , 27 ] .
The authors also showed that alpha v beta 3 and c - fms share a common intracellular signaling pathway , including the activation of ERK and the induction of c - Fos [ 27 ] , both of which are essential for osteoclastogenesis [ 28 , 29 ] .
In addition , it was reported that echistatin , an alpha v beta 3 antagonist , inhibited osteoclast formation of mouse:__entity__ bone marrow cells [ 30 ] .
In accordance with these reports , our data showed that knockdown of integrin - beta 3 expression resulted in downregulation of the alpha v beta 3 heterodimer , and abrogated osteoclastogenesis from human:__entity__ peripheral blood CD16 - monocytes .
We also showed that blocking of adhesive ligands to bind to alpha v beta 3 by RGDfV peptide inhibited osteoclast formation from CD16 - monocytes .
Taken together , the process of ligand binding to alpha v beta 3 may be involved in the osteoclastogenesis .
Blockade of alpha v beta 3 could therefore be a therapeutically beneficial approach to modulate osteoclastogenesis .
Indeed , integrin alpha v beta 3 antagonists effectively treated osteoporosis in mice:__entity__ , rats:__entity__ and humans:__entity__ , and protected bone destruction in rat adjuvant - induced arthritis in vivo [ 31 - 34 ] .
Of note , it is reported that patients:__entity__ with Iraqi - Jewish - type Glanzmann thrombasthenia who are deficient in integrin beta 3 do not develop osteopetrosis because of the upregulation of alpha 2 beta 1 expression on osteoclasts , although the bone - resorptive ability of the osteoclasts was decreased in vitro [ 35 ] .
The function of alpha v beta 3 in vivo in osteoclast formation and resorptive function could therefore be partially compensated by other integrins .
Although all the multinucleated osteoclasts expressed alpha v beta 3 ( Figure 4d ) [ 36 ] , a small number of M - CSF + RANKL - stimulated mononuclear CD16 - monocytes expressed alpha v beta 3 ( Figure 4d ) .
Multinucleated osteoclasts are formed by fusion of osteoclast precursor cells [ 37 ] .
It was reported that alpha v beta 3 is involved in the migration of osteoclast precursors [ 30 ] .
The alpha v beta 3 - positive cells could therefore be forced to migrate by the ligands and may fuse with closed alpha v beta 3 - negative cells .
Alternatively , only alpha v beta 3 - positive cells may be fused with each other .
It is possible to consider that signaling from CD16 by anti - CD16 mAb - coated magnetic beads , which were used for the cell separation , or by IgG contained in FBS might inhibit osteoclastogenesis from CD16 + monocytes .
We therefore separated the two subsets using anti - CD33 mAb and a fluorescent cell sorter , and stimulated the cells with M - CSF + RANKL .
The results showed that CD33low monocytes , which correspond to CD16 + monocytes , still could not differentiate into osteoclasts .
CD16 is a heterodimer consisting of Fc gamma IIIa and Fc gamma , and has low affinity for the Fc region of IgG .
Aggregation of CD16 by immune complexes leads to transmission of activating signals via the immunoreceptor tyrosine - based activation motif in the gamma chain [ 38 ] .
We also assessed osteoclastogenesis from the two monocyte subsets using IgG - depleted bovine:__entity__ serum .
Even in the IgG - free medium , CD16 - monocytes but not CD16 + monocytes differentiated into osteoclasts ( data not shown ) .
We could therefore exclude the possibility that signal transduction through CD16 inhibits osteoclastogenesis from CD16 + monocytes .
NFATc1 is a key transcription factor in osteoclastogenesis [ 16 ] .
In the present study , stimulation with M - CSF + RANKL increased the NFATc1 mRNA expression in the CD16 - subset only , similar to integrin alpha v and integrin beta 3 .
The differences in NFATc1 induction might therefore also explain the difference in osteoclastogenesis between the two monocyte subsets .
It is of interest that knockdown of integrin beta 3 did not lower the mRNA level of NFATc1 .
This result supports the notion that NFATc1 is located upstream of integrin - beta 3 expression [ 39 ] .
It is also possible that parallel activation of two signaling pathways mediated by integrin beta 3 and NFATc1 contributes to osteoclastogenesis independently or cooperatively .
Further studies are needed to determine the mechanisms of integrin beta 3 involvement in RANKL / RANK - mediated osteoclast differentiation .
It has been demonstrated that MAPK families , ERK and p38 MAPK , were activated by RANKL - induced intracellular signalings in osteoclasts and osteoclast precursors [ 18 , 19 ] .
In addition , these kinases are involved in the differentiation of osteoclasts [ 20 ] .
We showed that RANKL stimulation induced phosphorylation of ERK and p38 MAPK only in CD16 - monocytes .
It is suggested that differential activation of these kinases may partially explain the distinct properties of the two monocyte subsets upon RANKL stimulation .
Our results showed that CD16 + monocytes produce higher levels of inflammatory cytokines including TNF alpha and IL - 6 compared with CD16 - monocytes .
These results are consistent with the previous report showing that CD16 + monocytes produced larger amounts of TNF alpha upon lipopolysaccharide or lipopeptide stimulation than did CD16 - monocytes [ 40 ] .
Interestingly , we showed that stimulation either with RANKL or M - CSF upregulated the TNF alpha and IL - 6 production by CD16 + monocytes .
A marked increase of CD16 + monocytes in peripheral blood is reported in inflammatory diseases , such as infection , malignancy , Kawasaki disease and RA [ 41 - 44 ] .
Taken together , CD16 + monocytes may be an important source of inflammatory cytokines .
In mice:__entity__ , peripheral blood Ly - 6Chigh monocytes , which are thought to correspond to human:__entity__ CD16 - monocytes , increase in inflammatory conditions , and these cells are recruited into sites of inflammation [ 45 ] .
In contrast , Ly - 6Clow monocytes , which are thought to correspond to human:__entity__ CD16 + , migrate into noninflamed tissues [ 12 ] .
These data on mouse:__entity__ monocytes seem to be in contrast to the data on human:__entity__ monocytes , which show expansion of CD16 + monocytes in inflammatory conditions where they produce larger amounts of inflammatory cytokines .
At present , it is not clear whether mouse:__entity__ monocyte subsets , Ly - 6Clow / Ly - 6Chigh , represent human:__entity__ monocyte subsets , CD16 + / CD16 - monocytes , and whether the biologic functions of mouse:__entity__ monocytes are analogous to those of human:__entity__ monocytes .
In mice:__entity__ , blood monocytes newly released from the bone marrow are exclusively Ly - 6Chigh and the level of Ly - 6C is downregulated while in circulation [ 45 ] .
It is thus suggested that in mice:__entity__ the two monocyte subsets differing in Ly - 6C expression represent different stages in the maturation pathway .
In the human:__entity__ , transition from CD16 - monocytes to CD16 + monocytes is observed upon culture with IL - 10 , M - CSF and transforming growth factor beta in vitro [ 42 , 46 ] .
Similar to mouse:__entity__ monocytes , therefore , human:__entity__ peripheral blood CD16 - monocytes may also maturate into CD16 + monocytes .
It is reported that a significant number of RA synovial cells in the intima express CD16 , suggesting that CD16 + cells are synovial macrophages [ 47 ] .
We confirmed that both CD16 + and CD16 - macrophages accumulate in the RA synovium by double - color immunohistochemical staining for CD68 and CD16 .
A number of chemokines are abundantly expressed in the RA synovium [ 24 , 48 ] .
Among these cytokines , MCP - 1 , MIP - 1 alpha , SDF - 1 , RANTES and fractalkine can induce migration of CD16 - monocytes in vitro ( [ 11 , 12 ] and unpublished data ) .
On the other hand , migration of CD16 + monocytes is induced only by fractalkine .
These chemokines therefore seem to play an important role in recruitment of CD16 + and CD16 - monocytes from the circulating pool into the RA synovium .
The osteoclast inducers are also produced in the RA synovium .
RANKL is expressed by synovial fibroblasts and activated T cells [ 49 - 51 ] , while M - CSF is expressed on RA synovial macrophages and fibroblasts [ 52 , 53 ] .
TNF alpha and IL - 6 , which are mainly expressed on RA synovial macrophages and fibroblasts , respectively , could also enhance osteoclast differentiation [ 54 ] .
Collectively , it is probable that the recruited CD16 - monocytes / macrophages differentiate into osteoclasts in the RA synovium , and contribute to bone destruction .
On the other hand , CD16 + monocytes / macrophages might also be involved in RA pathogenesis by producing inflammatory cytokines including TNF alpha and IL - 6 .
Since TNF alpha and IL - 6 enhance osteoclast formation [ 54 , 55 ] , CD16 + monocytes / macrophages may also contribute to osteoclastogenesis in RA synovium .
Conclusion
We have shown that human:__entity__ peripheral blood monocytes consist of two functionally heterogeneous subsets with distinct response to osteoclastogenic stimuli .
Osteoclasts seem to originate from CD16 - monocytes , and integrin beta 3 is necessary for the osteoclastogenesis .
The blockade of accumulation and activation of CD16 - monocytes could therefore be a beneficial approach as an anti - bone resorptive therapy , especially for RA .

Embryonic sympathoblasts transiently express TrkB in vivo and proliferate in response to brain - derived neurotrophic factor in vitro
Abstract
Background
Nerve growth factor and neurotrophin - 3 are involved in the development of sympathetic neurons ; however , whether brain derived neurotrophic factor also plays a role is not known .
The purpose of this study was to determine whether BDNF and its receptor , TrkB , are expressed during the development of paravertebral sympathetic ganglia in vivo and to determine the effect of BDNF in vitro .
Results
As neural crest cells coalesce to form sympathetic ganglia , TrkB - positive cells are seen in both chicken:__entity__ and mouse:__entity__ embryos .
In chicken:__entity__ embryos , TrkB - expressing cells first appear at Hamburger - Hamilton Stage ( St ) 27 and they co - express HNK - 1 , confirming that they are migrating neural crest cells .
The TrkB - positive cells lack neural markers at this stage ; however , they migrate with other neurally differentiating cells that are TrkA and TrkC - positive .
By St .
29 / 30 , TrkB - positive cells begin to express the neural specific markers Hu C / D and Islet - 1 ; eventually , all TrkB positive cells commence neural differentiation .
By St .
34 , TrkB and TrkC staining are lost .
BDNF transcript expression parallels that of TrkB .
In the mouse:__entity__ , TrkB - positive cells surround newly formed sympathetic ganglia and a small number of TrkB positive cells that co - express tyrosine hydroxylase are seen within ganglia between E13 . 5 - 15 .
In cell culture , many cells from St .
29 - 30 chicken:__entity__ lumbar sympathetic ganglia express neural markers and are dividing , indicating that they are sympathoblasts .
Sympathoblasts and neurons require both nerve growth factor and neurotrophin - 3 for survival .
BDNF increases the number of cells expressing neural markers in culture by increasing number of cells that incorporate bromodeoxyuridine .
In contrast , most TrkB - positive sympathetic cells in vivo are not actively proliferating between E6 - E8 .
Conclusion
Developing paravertebral sympathetic ganglia in avian and murine embryos contain a subpopulation of sympathoblasts that transiently express TrkB and ultimately commence neuronal differentiation .
These TrkB expressing sympathoblasts are not actively dividing in vivo ; yet , when placed in vitro , will divide in response to BDNF .
This suggests that the availability of BDNF in vivo fails to reach a threshold necessary to induce proliferation .
We suggest that excess TrkB stimulation of sympathoblasts in vivo may lead to the genesis of neuroblastoma .
Background
Neural crest cells destined to become paravertebral sympathetic neurons proliferate and differentiate during migration and gangliogenesis .
In chicken:__entity__ embryos , migrating neural crest cells express catecholamines at Hamburger / Hamilton Stage ( St . ) 19 , and these cells form the primary sympathetic chain dorsolateral to the aorta at St .
22 ( E3 . 5 ) [ 1 ] .
Between St .
23 ( E4 ) and St .
28 ( E6 ) , these cells disperse and undergo a secondary migration to form the paravertebral sympathetic chain that resides ventral to the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion [ 1 ] .
After ganglia coalesce , sympathoblasts express markers of neuronal differentiation , such as Q211 and tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH ) , at a time when they also incorporate [ 3H ] - thymidine [ 2 ] .
Time lapse photography has shown that cultured E15 . 5 - E16 . 5 sympathetic neurons from rat:__entity__ embryos extend axons while they divide [ 3 - 5 ] .
Although proliferation appears to be an important process to expand the sympathetic neuron population during differentiation , the mechanisms that guide sympathoblast proliferation have not been identified .
The development of sympathetic neurons is guided by neurotrophins .
Neurotrophin - 3 ( NT - 3 ) binds to its receptor , TrkC , to promote the survival of cultured sympathoblasts from early lumbar paravertebral ganglia [ 6 ] .
Nerve growth factor ( NGF ) signals through its receptor , TrkA , to promote the survival of sympathetic neurons upon target innervation [ 7 ] .
There are severe sympathetic defects in the superior cervical ganglion of individual NT - 3 and NGF knockout mice:__entity__ [ 8 - 10 ] .
Furthermore , there is no additional cell death in the superior cervical ganglion of NT - 3 and NGF double knockout mouse:__entity__ embryos , suggesting that all of the neurons are dependent on both neurotrophins for survival [ 11 ] .
There is also an increase in sympathetic neuron cell death in TrkA knockout mice:__entity__ [ 12 ] .
However , in TrkB and BDNF knockout mice:__entity__ , there is no apparent phenotype in the superior cervical ganglion , and there is little evidence that TrkB or BDNF is expressed in sympathetic ganglia .
Thus , it is generally thought that TrkB and BDNF have little or no roles in guiding the development of sympathetic neurons .
In addition to their developmental functions , neurotrophin receptors regulate cell behavior in neuroblastoma , a tumor found in sympathetic ganglia and adrenal medulla .
Tumors that express TrkA often spontaneously regress , while those that express TrkB and its ligand , brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) , grow aggressively , are invasive , and fail to respond to chemotherapeutic agents [ 13 ] .
The presence of TrkA in neuroblastoma tumors is consistent with its expression in developing sympathetic neurons , and suggests that regressive neuroblastoma tumors arise from early sympathetic neurons that express TrkA .
The function of TrkB in early sympathetic development is unknown , which makes understanding the etiology of aggressive neuroblastoma tumors difficult .
Based on its function in neuroblastoma tumors , we hypothesize that BDNF and TrkB expression in differentiating sympathoblasts is responsible for expanding the neuronal population through proliferation .
We sought to determine whether BDNF and TrkB are involved in sympathetic development .
We report that during early embryonic development , TrkB is expressed in a subset of differentiating sympathoblasts in both avian and murine embryos .
We also find that BDNF promotes the proliferation of TrkB - positive sympathoblasts in cell culture .
However , the majority of TrkB positive cells in vivo fail to take up bromodeoxyuridine ( BrdU ) over a 24 hr period , suggesting that endogenous BDNF concentrations do not reach a threshold necessary to stimulate proliferation of sympathoblasts .
Shortly after all of the TrkB positive cells commence neuronal differentiation , TrkB immunoreactivity is lost .
These results suggest that prolonged expression and / or activation of TrkB signaling at these early stages may be an early event triggering the formation of neuroblastoma .
Results
TrkB is expressed during migration of neural crest cells to sympathetic ganglia
We first determined whether TrkB is expressed in neural crest - derived cells in the region ventral to the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia where sympathetic ganglia coalesce between Hamburger / Hamilton Stages ( St . ) 25 - 28 / 29 .
To identify cells that have commenced neuronal differentiation , transverse sections of the lumbar spinal column region were stained with antibodies against Hu C / D [ 14 ] , a neuronal - specific RNA - binding protein , or Islet - 1 , a transcription factor found in sympathetic neurons [ 15 ] .
We found that Hu C / D and Islet - 1 are expressed in the same cells both in vivo and in vitro throughout sympathetic development .
In experiments done between St .
25 and 28 , Islet - 1 staining appeared weaker than Hu C / D staining , and thus we used Hu C / D to identify differentiating neurons at these stages .
At later stages , Islet - 1 was used to facilitate the identification of neurons because of the nuclear location of its immunoreactivity .
Cells expressing Hu C / D are first detected at St .
25 ventral to the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion and lateral to the dorsal aorta ( Figure 1A , 1B ) .
By St .
26 , the number of cells that express Hu C / D in this region increases dramatically ( Figure 1C ) .
TrkB - expressing cells first appear at St .
27 in the same region and are adjacent to Hu C / D - positive cells ( Figure 1D , 2A , 2H ) .
TrkB - positive cells co - localize with a neural crest marker , HNK - 1 ( Figures 2B , 2C , 2D ) .
The Hu C / D - positive cells in this region are likely to be sympathetic neurons , since they appear in the region where sympathetic ganglia form and express tyrosine hydroxylase , a rate - limiting enzyme in the synthesis of catecholamines ( Figures 2E , 2F , 2G ) .
At St .
28 / 29 , the cells begin to coalesce ventral to the dorsal root ganglion and the Hu C / D - positive cells and TrkB - positive cells remain as two separate cell populations ( Figure 1E ) ; however , shortly afterwards , all of the TrkB - positive cells begin to express Islet - 1 ( Figure 3B ) and Hu C / D ( data not shown ) .
Developmental regulation of TrkA , TrkB , TrkC , and BDNF expression
In contrast to TrkB , the other neurotrophin receptors , TrkA and TrkC , are co - expressed in both Hu C / D - positive and Hu C / D - negative cells at St .
27 ( Figures 2I , 2J ) .
We find that approximately 30 % of the Islet - 1 - positive cells express TrkA ( Figure 3A ) , while 50 % express TrkB ( Figure 3B ) and 100 % express TrkC ( Figure 3C ) at St .
29 / 30 ( E6 . 5 ) .
Thus , all developing neurons express TrkC in combination with either TrkA or TrkB .
By St .
31 ( E7 ) , the number of TrkA - positive , Islet - 1 - positive cells increases to 100 % ( Figure 3D ) and immunoreactivities for both TrkB and TrkC appear dispersed ( Figure 3E , 3F ) .
By St .
34 ( E8 ) , TrkA expression is well - sustained ( Figure 3G ) and TrkB and TrkC immunoreactivities are lost ( Figure 3H , 3I ) .
We also examined the early development of murine sympathetic ganglia ( Figure 4 ) .
At E13 , the newly formed lumbar sympathetic ganglia can be observed ventral to the spinal cord and notochord by their staining for Hu C / D and TH ( Figure 4A ) .
TrkB - positive cells can be seen surrounding developing ganglia , as well as in occasional cells within the ganglia ( Figure 4C , D ) .
These TrkB - positive cells within the ganglia co - express TH and are seen at a frequency of 1 - 2 cells per section starting at E13 ( Figure 4A - D ) and are still present at E15 . 5 ( data not shown ) .
In neuroblastoma cells , BDNF is co - expressed with TrkB , suggesting that autocrine stimulation is a means by which proliferation is sustained in the transformed cells .
To test whether BDNF , the ligand for TrkB , was present in embryonic chick:__entity__ sympathetic ganglia , we used quantitative real - time PCR with TaqMan probes to determine the relative abundance of BDNF transcripts in total RNA extracted from lumbar sympathetic ganglia at St .
29 / 30 ( E6 . 5 ) , St .
31 ( E7 ) , St .
34 ( E8 ) , and E9 .
BDNF expression within the ganglia parallels that of TrkB : BDNF mRNA expression levels are highest at St 29 / 30 ( E6 . 5 ) , and these levels decrease 2 - fold at St .
31 ( E7 ) and St .
34 ( E8 ; Figure 5 ) .
By E9 , BDNF levels are 7 times lower than at St .
29 / 30 ( E6 . 5 ; Figure 5 ) .
NT3 and NGF promote survival of differentiating sympathetic neurons in culture
To determine the effect of neurotrophins , we cultured cells dispersed from lumbar sympathetic ganglia at St .
29 / 30 ( E6 . 5 ) because , at this stage , ganglion formation is complete , the number of TrkA - , TrkB - , and TrkC - positive cells have peaked , and all Trk - expressing cells have initiated neural differentiation .
First , we identified markers expressed by acutely isolated cells .
As shown in Table 1 , 80 - 91 % of the cells are p75 neurotrophin receptor ( NTR ) - positive , indicating that most of the cells are neural crest - derived and little mesenchymal contamination is introduced by the isolation procedure .
In addition , 28 - 33 % of the cultured cells express the neural marker Hu C / D .
Approximately half of these Hu C / D - positive cells express TrkB .
Conversely , all of the TrkB positive cells express Hu C / D .
These TrkB - positive cells comprise approximately 14 - 17 % of the total cell population .
We then determined how many of the acutely isolated cells were proliferating by incubating them for 12 hrs in BrdU - containing medium .
For these experiments , we identified differentiating neurons with the transcription factor Islet - 1 because this marker labels nuclei , thus it co localizes with any BrdU that has been incorporated into the DNA , allowing us to determine whether the cell had undergone S - phase of the cell cycle .
After 12 hrs in BrdU , 59 % of Islet - 1 - positive nuclei stain for BrdU immunoreactivity .
Thus , cultures of St .
29 / 30 sympathetic ganglia contain many cells that proliferate while exhibiting markers of neuronal differentiation , confirming previous observations [ 2 ] .
We call these dividing neuronal precursors sympathoblasts .
The remaining non - BrdU incorporating , Islet - 1 positive cells are likely to be post mitotic neurons .
Finally , we determined the trophic requirements of St .
29 / 30 ( E6 . 5 ) sympathetic neurons and sympathoblasts .
We monitored cultures over a three day period after plating and counted the number of phase bright cells with neurites , a morphological feature of both neurons and sympathoblasts .
In the absence of trophic factors , more than 2 / 3 of the cells die by 24 hours in culture and BDNF , NT - 3 , or NGF alone is not sufficient to promote survival ( Figure 6 ) .
However , NGF together with NT - 3 supports the survival of a significantly larger number of cells ( Figure 6 ) .
For the subsequent experiments , all neurons were cultured with 25 ng / ml NT - 3 and 1 mu g / ml 7S NGF to optimize survival .
BDNF promotes proliferation of TrkB - positive sympathetic neurons in culture
To determine the effects of BDNF , cultures of cells from St .
29 / 30 ( E6 . 5 ) sympathetic ganglia were supplemented with 200 ng / ml BDNF and the number of neurons and sympathoblasts were counted at 24 , 48 , and 72 hours using phase microscopy ( Figure 7A ) .
A 1 . 6 - fold increase in the number of neurons due to BDNF is observed by 24 hours and this number does not increase further at 48 or 72 hours .
This effect of BDNF is concentration - dependent with an EC50 of 75 ng / ml ( Figure 7B ) .
To test whether the increase in the number of neurons and sympathoblasts caused by BDNF is due to the differentiation of pluripotent neural crest cells , we quantified the effects of BDNF on the number of neurally differentiating cells ( Hu C / D - positive ) versus the number of non - neuronal cells ( Hu C / D - negative ) after identifying all neural crest - derived cells by staining for p75NTR in St .
29 / 30 ( E6 . 5 ) cultures .
If BDNF increases the number of neurons and sympathoblasts by inducing a non - neuronal cell to express Hu C / D , then we expected that the total cell number would remain the same and that there would be a decrease in the number of non - neuronal cells as well as a corresponding increase in the number of neurons .
After 24 hours , BDNF significantly increases the number of p75NTR - positive cells as well as the number of Hu C / D - positive cells ( Figure 8A ) .
However , there was no statistically significant change in the number of non - neuronal cells .
Thus , it is unlikely that BDNF increases the number of neurons and sympathoblasts by inducing differentiation of non - neuronal cells .
To determine whether the increase in the total number of neurons and sympathoblasts is caused by BDNF - induced proliferation , control and BDNF - treated sympathetic cultures were exposed to BrdU for 12 hours after plating , and the number of cells that incorporated BrdU into their DNA was determined after 24 hours in culture .
Even in the control condition , a number of cells in the culture are dividing , giving a high baseline of BrdU incorporation ( Figure 8B ) .
When BDNF is added , the total number of BrdU positive cells increases approximately 1 . 6 - fold ( Figure 8B ) .
This BDNF - induced increase in the total number of BrdU positive cells occurs in sympathoblasts because the number of Islet - 1 - positive nuclei from control cultures that label with BrdU is 268 +/- 59 and BDNF treatment raises this number to 424 +/- 80 , which corresponds to an increase of 1 . 6 - fold .
This accounts for the 1 . 6 - fold increase in total neuron number and total BrdU - positive cells described above .
We then confirmed that BDNF acts on TrkB - positive cells : BDNF increases the number of TrkB - expressing cells that incorporate BrdU 2 . 6 - 4 - fold over control ( Table 2 ) and it also increases the overall number of TrkB - positive cells 2 - 2 . 5 - fold over control ( Table 2 ) .
BDNF does not increase the number of BrdU - positive , TrkB - negative cells or the overall number of TrkB - negative cells ( Table 2 ) .
In further support that BDNF acts directly on TrkB - expressing cells , an antibody directed against the extracellular domain of TrkB completely prevents the effect of BDNF in promoting proliferation of TrkB - positive , but not TrkB - negative cells ( compare Figure 9A to 9B ) .
Thus , the effect of BDNF is restricted to the population that expresses TrkB , which are developing sympathoblasts .
To determine whether TrkB - positive cells are actively proliferating in vivo , embryos were injected with BrdU at St .
27 and harvested at St .
29 , approximately 24 hrs later .
The majority ( 85 - 90 % ) of TrkB - positive cells do not incorporate BrdU into their nuclei under basal conditions in vivo ( Figure 10 ) , although a few TrkB positive cells with labeled nuclei could be observed ( arrows ) .
This contrasts with our observation that 71 - 76 % of TrkB - positive cells incorporate BrdU in culture after treatment with BDNF ( Table 2 ) , suggesting that endogenous BDNF does not achieve a threshold sufficient to support a high level of sympathoblast proliferation in vivo .
Discussion
We report that the neurotrophin receptor TrkB is expressed in a subset of embryonic sympathoblasts during the early development of lumbar paravertebral sympathetic ganglia in chicken:__entity__ and mouse:__entity__ embryos .
In the chicken:__entity__ , TrkB expression is transient , and completely lost by St 34 ( E8 ) .
Since BDNF induces the proliferation of sympathoblasts in cell culture , yet in vivo there is little proliferation observed in TrkB - positive cells in nascent ganglia , we propose that if TrkB activation becomes unregulated by excess BDNF or constitutive phosphorylation of TrkB [ 16 ] , this transient population of TrkB - positive sympathoblasts may trigger the genesis of neuroblastoma , a childhood tumor found in the paravertebral chain and adrenal medulla .
The two populations of sympathoblasts that we observe support previous findings of heterogeneity among developing sympathetic neurons and neural crest cells .
Early sympathetic ganglia contain at least two subpopulations : early differentiating neurons that lack TrkB expression and express TrkA and TrkC , and late differentiating sympathoblasts that express TrkB .
Explant cultures of sympathetic ganglia from E16 chick:__entity__ embryos give rise to two neuronal populations : one that remains close to the explant , and one that migrates away from the explant [ 1 ] .
In addition , early neuronal subpopulations have been observed in cultures of neural crest cells from St .
13 / 14 quail embryos as evidenced by the expression of neuronal cell type - specific gangliosides [ 17 ] .
Perhaps these different subpopulations will ultimately give rise to the two neurochemically distinct populations found in lumbar sympathetic ganglia : the noradrenergic , NPY - containing neurons that innervate internal organs and enteric ganglia and the cholinergic , VIP - containing neurons that innervate vasculature in the hind limbs .
The effects of BDNF and TrkB deletion and over expression have been studied on superior cervical ganglion and preganglionic neurons in thoracic segments of the spinal column , but not on paravertebral sympathetic neurons .
In the superior cervical ganglion , an increase in the number of neurons of BDNF null mice:__entity__ is likely due to apoptosis induced by BDNF via p75NTR [ 18 ] .
In contrast , the responses of paravertebral sympathetic neurons to BDNF are complex and subtype dependent .
Over expression of BDNF leads to an increase in the number of noradrenergic fibers innervating the erector pilli muscles of hair follicles , while noradrenergic fibers innervating blood vessels were unaffected [ 19 ] .
If our results indicating that BDNF promotes proliferation of TrkB - positive sympathoblasts in the chicken:__entity__ embryo can be extrapolated to the subset of TrkB - positive sympathoblasts in murine ganglia , then these TrkB - positive cells may be neurons destined to innervate the erector pilli .
In other studies , TrkB null mice:__entity__ showed no changes in morphology or cell number in superior cervical ganglia [ 12 ] or in the intermediolateral column [ 20 ] ; but this may not be predictive of a phenotype in the lumbar paravertebral chain .
It is thus possible that BDNF / TrkB signaling could play a specific role in other regions of the paravertebral sympathetic chain , such as the lumbar region .
However , if TrkB - positive cells are not normally actively proliferating in vivo , then it would not be surprising that the development of the paravertebral sympathetic chain is not disrupted in TrkB or BDNF null mice:__entity__ .
It may be more informative to examine mice:__entity__ that over express BDNF on a promoter that targets expression to embryonic lumbar ganglia .
Unfortunately , such mice:__entity__ do not exist .
Our findings that the St .
29 / 30 ( E6 . 5 ) sympathoblasts are dependent on both NT - 3 and NGF for survival in culture are consistent with previous work on mouse:__entity__ sympathoblasts from the superior cervical ganglion [ 11 ] .
In these studies , NT - 3 and NGF deletion separately led to a decrease in the number of sympathetic neurons at E17 . 5 compared to control .
Deletion of both NT - 3 and NGF together did not enhance cell death .
In contrast , cultured rat:__entity__ superior cervical ganglion sympathetic neurons respond to NT - 3 at E14 . 5 and then to NGF at E19 . 5 , although time points in between were not analyzed [ 6 ] .
In addition to promoting survival , NT - 3 , NGF , and BDNF also induce proliferation of various neuronal precursors at different stages of development .
NT - 3 can promote the incorporation of [ 3H ] - thymidine into cultured quail neural crest cells from the trunk region [ 21 , 22 ] , Later in rat:__entity__ sympathetic development , NT - 3 supports survival of neurons , but does not promote proliferation [ 6 ] , which is consistent with our results .
NGF promotes an increase in BrdU incorporation from 25 % to 35 % in the DRG cervical segment 2 in the chick:__entity__ embryo [ 23 ] .
In chicken:__entity__ embryos that are treated with NGF in ovo at St .
18 and 21 , there is an increase in BrdU uptake after formation of the primary sympathetic chain at St .
23 [ 24 ] .
Since NGF does not appear to affect proliferation of St .
29 / 30 ( E6 . 5 ) chick:__entity__ sympathoblasts , NGF may only promote proliferation in primary , but not secondary chain sympathoblasts .
Motor neuron progenitors in the ventral neural tube from the chick:__entity__ embryo express TrkB and when ventral neural tube explants are treated with BDNF , there is an increase in the number of motor neurons produced and BrdU incorporation [ 25 ] .
BDNF also promotes the proliferation of cultured neuroblastoma cells [ 13 ] .
Taken together , these results are consistent with our findings that NT - 3 and NGF do not promote proliferation of St .
29 / 30 ( E6 . 5 ) sympathoblasts , and support the assertion that BDNF promotes proliferation of TrkB - positive sympathoblasts in culture .
Our observations suggest a transient function of TrkB during early sympathetic development in supporting proliferation of this early subpopulation of sympathoblasts .
However , the in vivo labeling suggests that only a minority ( 10 - 20 % ) of this population is dividing during the window that TrkB is expressed .
In light of the very strong proliferative effect produced in cell culture , these TrkB expressing cells could respond more strongly if endogenous BDNF rises to higher levels , or if the mechanism that down regulates TrkB expression becomes nonfunctional .
Such events could trigger an early proliferative event that leads to a cascade of changes that initiates transformation of cells to neuroblastoma .
Thus , these early TrkB expressing cells help solve the puzzle as to why TrkB is expressed in aggressive and invasive forms of neuroblastoma , particularly because BDNF induces cultured neuroblastoma cells to become more proliferative , invasive , angiogenic , and resistant to chemotherapeutic reagents than untreated cultures [ 13 ] .
Future studies will determine whether constitutive expression of BDNF and TrkB in the chick:__entity__ embryo sustains proliferation of differentiating sympathoblasts .
Conclusion
We have identified a time point during development when differentiating lumbar sympathetic neurons transiently express TrkB and proliferate in response to high concentrations of BDNF in culture .
These studies suggest that elevated BDNF expression above basal levels and signaling through TrkB may be a mechanism that contributes to the onset of neuroblastoma .
A further understanding of the two populations of sympathetic neurons and the fate of the TrkB - positive cells will provide additional insight into the development of paravertebral sympathetic ganglia and the genesis of neuroblastoma .
Methods
Preparation of tissue for immunohistochemistry
The lumbar spinal column and surrounding tissues were dissected from chicken:__entity__ embryos at the indicated stages and placed in Zamboni ' s fixative ( 4 % ( w / v ) paraformaldehyde , 15 % ( v / v ) picric acid in 0 . 1 M sodium phosphate buffer , pH 7 . 4 ) for two hours at room temperature .
Mouse:__entity__ embryos at 13 - 15 days post - coitus were collected according to an IACUC - approved protocol to Dr . L .
Sherman at the Oregon Health and Science University .
The mouse:__entity__ embryos were immersion - fixed in Zamboni ' s fixative overnight at 4 degrees C then washed with phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ; 130 mM NaCl , 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer , pH 7 . 4 ) .
Fixed tissues were equilibrated in 30 % sucrose in 1 x phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) .
Fixed mouse:__entity__ embryos were shipped to Vermont in sucrose .
Transverse 30 mu M sections of the spinal columns were cut at on a Microm HM cryostat ( knife temperature : 16 degrees C ; object temperature : 23 degrees C ) and collected on Superfrost Plus slides ( Fisher ) .
Sections were dried at room temperature , washed in 1 x PBS and incubated overnight in blocking buffer ( 1 x PBS consisting of 10 % ( v / v ) heat - inactivated horse:__entity__ serum ( Invitrogen / Gibco ) , 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 ( Sigma ) , and 0 . 1 % sodium azide ( Fisher ) ) .
Immunohistochemistry
Sections were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 degrees C , followed by incubation with secondary antibodies for 2 hours at room temperature .
Primary antibodies used were : rabbit:__entity__ anti - p75 ( 1 : 1500 , generous gift from Louis Reichardt , UCSF [ 26 ] ) , mouse:__entity__ IgG2b anti - Hu C / D , ( 1 : 250 , Molecular Probes ) ; mouse:__entity__ IgG1 anti - Islet - 1 , ( 1 : 10 , Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank ) ; rabbit:__entity__ anti - chicken:__entity__ TrkA ( 1 : 500 ) ; rabbit:__entity__ anti - chicken:__entity__ TrkB ( 1 : 500 ) ; rabbit:__entity__ anti - chicken:__entity__ TrkC ( 1 : 500 ) ( all Trk antibodies were generous gifts of Dr . Louis Reichardt , UCSF [ 26 - 28 ] ) ; mouse:__entity__ anti - HNK - 1 ( 1 : 50 , Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank ) ; mouse:__entity__ IgG2a anti - tyrosine hydroxylase ( 1 : 10 , Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank ) , sheep:__entity__ anti - BrdU ( 1 : 100 , Biodesign International ) , rabbit:__entity__ anti - tyrosine hydroxylase ( 1 : 100 , Chemicon ) , and goat:__entity__ anti - TrkB ( 1 : 1000 , R & D Systems ) .
Immunofluorescence was imaged using a Nikon C1 confocal mounted on a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope with a 10 x Plan Apo ( NA 0 . 785 ) air objective or a 60 x Plan Apo ( NA 1 . 4 ) oil objective lens , E7 - C1 software , and UV , Argon , and He / Ne lasers exciting at 408 , 488 , and 543 nm and emitting at 404 500 - 530 , and 555 - 615 nm , respectively .
A Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope in the nearby COBRE Molecular / Cellular Core Facility was used for counting immunofluorescent cells at 200 x using epifluorescence optics .
RNA Extraction / cDNA synthesis
Sympathetic ganglia were removed from chick:__entity__ embryos and RNA was isolated using TriReagent ( Molecular Research Center ) , an acidified guanidinium with phenol extraction method [ 29 ] .
RNA was transcribed to cDNA using oligo - dT with Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase ( Invitrogen ) at 42 degrees C for 1 hour .
Real - time PCR
Relative RNA levels were determined using quantitative real - time PCR with an ABI 7500 Fast Real Time PCR System .
TaqMan probes were used to quantify the progression of the PCR reaction and reactions were normalized using the constitutively expressed gene chick:__entity__ ribosomal binding protein s17 ( CHRPS ) .
The sequences were used for primer / probes sets : for BDNF : forward : 5 ' - AGCCCAGTGAGGAAAACAAG - 3 ' , reverse : 5 ' - ACTCCTCGAGCAGAAAGAGC - 3 ' , probe : 5 ' - [ 6 - FAM ] - TACACATCCCGAGTCATGCTGAGCA - [ BHQ ] - 3 ' ; for CHRPS ( chick:__entity__ ribosomal binding protein S - 17 ) : 5 ' AACGACTTCCACACCAACAA3 ' , reverse : 5 ' CTTCATCAGGTGGGTGACAT3 ' , probe : 5 ' - [ 6 - FAM ] - CGCCATCATCCCCAGCAAGA [ BHQ ] - 3 ' .
Primers and probes were synthesized by Operon Technologies , Inc ( Alameda , CA ) .
The primers for BDNF were validated against primers for CHRPS according to an Applied BioSystems protocol by serially diluting the target cDNA 1 : 10 , determining the cycle threshold ( Ct ) for each reaction , and plotting the Ct versus log concentration .
Slopes of the resulting lines were calculated and primers were accepted if their Ct slopes were between - 3 . 2 and - 3 . 4 ( a perfect efficiency of 1 . 0 yields a slope of - 3 . 3 ) .
To analyze the data , the delta Ct method of relative quantification was used , where the Ct of Chrps was subtracted from the Ct of the gene of interest ( Delta Ct ) and the arbitrary units of mRNA were expressed as 10000 / 2 ^ ( Delta Ct ) .
Cell culture
Sympathetic neurons were cultured as previously described [ 30 ] with a few modifications .
Sympathetic ganglia were removed from the lumbar region of the paravertebral chain of St .
29 / 30 ( E6 . 5 ) chick:__entity__ embryos and placed in Modified Puck ' s solution with glucose ( MPG ) .
The cells were dissociated by incubation of sympathetic ganglia with 0 . 1 % trypsin in MPG at 37 degrees C for 10 minutes followed by triturating with a fire polished 9 " Pasteur pipette .
Cells were then resuspended in Dulbecco ' s Modified Eagle Medium ( DMEM ) consisting of 10 % horse:__entity__ serum , 2 % fetal calf serum , and 10 mg / ml penicillin / streptomycin .
For neurotrophin studies , the culture medium was supplemented with 25 ng / ml NT - 3 ( R & D Systems ) and 1 mu g / ml 7S NGF ( Alomone Labs ) upon plating , and 50 ng / ml , 100 ng / ml , or 200 ng / ml BDNF ( R & D Systems ) once the cells adhered to the wells .
Cells were plated on poly - D - lysine / laminin coated wells or cover slips ( Fisher ) as previously described [ 30 ] .
Quantification of neurons and sympathoblasts using phase microscopy
Embryonic sympathoblasts and neurons are small , phase bright cells with neurites .
The total number of cells with neurites the length of two cell bodies were counted in 10 non - overlapping fields of view evenly spaced in a grid - like pattern across the bottom of a well from a 24 well plate at 200 x using a Nikon Eclipse TE200 microscope .
BrdU labeling
For in vitro studies , approximately 2 hours after plating cells from St .
29 / 30 ( E6 . 5 ) sympathetic ganglia , cells were labeled with 10 mu M bromodeoxyuridine ( BrdU , Sigma ) for 12 hours at 37 degrees C .
Following this labeling period , cells were incubated in complete medium without BrdU for an additional 10 hrs .
Cells were then fixed in Zamboni ' s fixative for 30 min at room temperature and rinsed with 1 x PBS .
For in vivo studies , 25 mu g BrdU was injected into the amnion of chick:__entity__ embryos at St .
27 .
The cells and sections were denatured with 2 N HCl at 37 degrees C for 1 hr , and were then neutralized with 0 . 1 M borate buffer , pH 8 . 5 , for 10 min at room temperature .
Immunochemistry was performed as described above .

Video analysis of the escape flight of Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ Dryocopus:__entity__ pileatus:__entity__ : does the Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ Campephilus:__entity__ principalis:__entity__ persist in continental North America ?
Abstract
Background
The apparent rediscovery of the Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ Campephilus:__entity__ principalis:__entity__ in Arkansas , USA , previously feared extinct , was supported by video evidence of a single bird in flight ( Fitzpatrick et al , Science 2005 , 308 : 1460 - 1462 ) .
Plumage patterns and wingbeat frequency of the putative Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ were said to be incompatible with the only possible confusion species native to the area , the Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ Dryocopus:__entity__ pileatus:__entity__ .
Results
New video analysis of Pileated:__entity__ Woodpeckers:__entity__ in escape flights comparable to that of the putative Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ filmed in Arkansas shows that Pileated:__entity__ Woodpeckers:__entity__ can display a wingbeat frequency equivalent to that of the Arkansas bird during escape flight .
The critical frames from the Arkansas video that were used to identify the bird as an Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ are shown to be equally , or more , compatible with the Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ .
Conclusion
The identification of the bird filmed in Arkansas in April 2004 as an Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ is best regarded as unsafe .
The similarities between the Arkansas bird and known Pileated:__entity__ Woodpeckers:__entity__ suggest that it was most likely a Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ .
Background
The reported rediscovery of the Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ in 2004 - 5 in the Big Woods of Arkansas gave new impetus to efforts to conserve the mature bottomland woodlands of the south - eastern USA .
Several sightings have been reported without photographic evidence being obtained [ 1 ] .
Unless sightings are , however , independently verifiable on the basis of photographic or other recorded evidence , the possibility that mistakes have been made cannot be eliminated .
Crucial to the scientific case for the persistence of the Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ was a 4 s video of a large woodpecker in flight recorded by M . D .
Luneau on 25 April 2004 ( henceforth referred to as the ' Luneau video ' ) and published in 2005 [ 1 ] , which was claimed to be inconsistent with the plumage patterns of the superficially similar Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ ( a common resident bird of the area ) .
Both species are large , black - and - white woodpeckers [ 2 ] .
The upperwing of the Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ is black , with white secondary feathers and white on some inner primary feathers .
Pileated:__entity__ Woodpeckers:__entity__ have a largely black upperwing , with white restricted to the ' wrist ' due to white bases to the primary feathers .
The underwing of Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ has all - white underwing coverts , giving an appearance of a white underwing with a broad black outline ( the black flight feathers ) .
These plumage differences result in the Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ having a white trailing edge to the wings ( upper and lower sides ) , whereas the Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ has a black trailing edge to the wings .
Both species have black wing - tips .
These and other plumage characteristics are shown in [ 1 , 2 ] .
The wingbeat frequency of the bird in the Luneau video was measured at 8 . 6 beats s - 1 , similar to that inferred from archival sound recording of a single Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ , but claimed to be outside the range of Pileated:__entity__ Woodpeckers:__entity__ ( which generally have slower wingbeats ) [ 1 , 3 ] .
Sibley et al [ 4 ] questioned the video evidence , in particular providing alternative explanations for the plumage patterns of the Luneau bird in flight and at rest .
They pointed out individual frames of the Luneau video that appear to show three features that are each inconsistent with Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ : ( 1 ) apparently black secondary feathers on the upper surface of the left wing , ( 2 ) particularly bright white primary bases , and ( 3 ) a black band curving smoothly round the wing tip ( see Figure 3 in [ 4 ] ) .
They hypothesized that flexing of a Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ ' s wings during flight could produce the appearance of white trailing edges on both wings in low - quality videos [ 4 ] .
They offered , however , no direct evidence to show that this could cause a video of a Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ to look like the bird in the Luneau video .
Fitzpatrick et al [ 5 ] in turn rebutted some aspects of the hypothesis of Sibley et al [ 4 ] , publishing video stills of Pileated:__entity__ Woodpeckers:__entity__ , and a model of a Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ , that appeared to show a black trailing edge to the wings inconsistent with Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ and the Luneau video .
Fitzpatrick et al [ 5 ] neither rebutted nor discussed the three key inconsistencies described above .
Without further evidence , this became largely a theoretical debate over interpretation of field characters that were barely visible in the very small images originally obtained .
On one hand , as pointed out in Sibley et al [ 4 ] , some of the frames of the bird in the Luneau video do appear to be inconsistent with Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ .
On the other hand , the flight pattern of the bird in the Luneau video is asserted to be atypical for Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ ( but matching anecdotal descriptions of Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ ) .
Furthermore , the general impression of the bird in the Luneau video was that there is far too much white in the wings for it to be a Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ , and that if it was a Pileated , then it must be an aberrant one with abnormally extensive white plumage .
Such birds occasionally occur , and have been observed in the Arkansas study area [ 6 ] .
This study was undertaken to determine whether the flight and plumage of the bird in the Luneau video really was inconsistent with either a normal or partial albino Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ .
Independent analyses of the plumage patterns and wingbeat frequencies observable in Pileated:__entity__ Woodpeckers:__entity__ are presented , and it is concluded that the identification of the bird in the Luneau video as definite Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ is probably unsafe .
Results
On January 28 and February 5 , 2006 , David Nolin ( DN ) video - recorded Pileated:__entity__ Woodpeckers:__entity__ Dryocopus:__entity__ pileatus:__entity__ at a bird - feeder in Dayton , Ohio , USA .
A Hi - 8 Sony Handycam was used , hand - held , at approximately 5 m from the feeder .
Birds on the tree trunk were alarmed by movement , and their escape flights recorded .
Four escape flights were captured that approximate to that recorded for the putative Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ Campephilus:__entity__ principalis:__entity__ by Luneau in April 2004 and published in Fitzpatrick et al [ 1 ] .
The videos are not directly equivalent because the Pileated:__entity__ Woodpeckers:__entity__ made only short escape flights to nearby trees , whereas the putative Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ in the Luneau video showed little sign of coming to rest before being lost from view .
Nevertheless , interesting comparisons can be made .
Wingbeat frequency of Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__
The woodpecker in the Luneau video maintains a steady rapid wingbeat rate of 8 . 6 beats s - 1 for at least 8 wingbeats [ 1 ] , a figure that was confirmed by independent analysis during preparation of this paper .
The Pileated:__entity__ woodpeckers:__entity__ in DN ' s video do not do this - after initial rapid flapping immediately after take - off , they settle into a more relaxed level flight .
As shown in Tables 1 and 2 , although the mean wingbeat frequencies of the Pileated:__entity__ Woodpeckers:__entity__ in DN ' s video are slower than the 8 . 6 s - 1 recorded for the bird in the Luneau video [ 1 , 3 , 5 ] the first four wingbeats , the initial escape response , are faster than those claimed for Pileated:__entity__ Woodpeckers:__entity__ in the literature [ 1 , 3 , 5 ] .
For the four escape flights , the mean frequency values for the first four wingbeats are 7 . 1 , 6 . 7 , 8 . 6 , and 8 . 0 s - 1 , respectively .
The 8 . 6 beats s - 1 of the bird identified in the Luneau video , while consistent with the limited data ( n = 1 ; see Discussion ) for Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ , is equally consistent with Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ in its initial escape flight .
The bird in the Luneau video maintains a frequency of 8 . 6 s - 1 for the next four wingbeats too , whereas the Pileated:__entity__ Woodpeckers:__entity__ recorded here all slowed their flight as they prepared to land in nearby trees .
There are no data to suggest whether Pileated:__entity__ Woodpeckers:__entity__ can maintain a wingbeat frequency approaching 8 . 6 s - 1 for eight or more wingbeats , like the bird in the Luneau video .
It remains possible that the flight pattern of the bird in the Luneau video is unusual for Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ , but a frequency of 8 . 6 s - 1 is consistent with a Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ gaining initial speed and height in escape flight , and by itself cannot be taken as strong evidence that the Luneau video bird was an Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ .
This is discussed further below .
Plumage pattern of Pileated:__entity__ Woodpeckers:__entity__ in flight
The video of Pileated:__entity__ Woodpeckers:__entity__ in flight was obtained in avi format , decompiled and examined frame by frame .
Comparisons of Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ images with key images of Luneau video are shown in Figures 1 and 2 , and suggest a genuine resemblance between the bird in the Luneau video and a Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ .
Analysis is complicated by the different digital processing of the two videos , and in the case of the Nolin videos it is important to concentrate only on those frames or part - frames where apparent plumage features are not an artifact of blurred images .
Thirty - six frames from the fourth example of Pileated escape flight , which most resembled the flight path of the Luneau video bird , were analysed systematically frame by frame .
They represent seven complete wingbeats ( 1 . 20 s from the middle of the second wingbeat to middle of wingbeat 9 ) and were directly compared frame - by - frame with the equivalent fields ( middle wingbeat 2 - middle wingbeat 9 ) of the Luneau video .
This comparison is shown in Figure 3 .
The images of the birds are not identical , but in every frame of the 36 frames available , there are sufficient similarities to suggest that the bird in the Luneau video is consistent with the known Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ .
Further comparisons of the Luneau bird with the other three Pileated:__entity__ escape flights recorded are presented in the supplementary material ( see Additional file 1 ) .
Key findings of the video analysis are :
1 .
Pileated:__entity__ Woodpeckers:__entity__ flying near - horizontally away from the observer show much more white in poor - quality video than would be expected from their general plumage pattern .
They present an appearance of a black - bodied bird with largely white wings and black wingtips , very similar to the bird in the Luneau video ; compare in particular Figure 1B , frame 758 , with Figure 1A , frame 283 . 3 .
The expected appearance of the upperwing of Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ - mostly black with a small white patch at the base of the primaries - is often not seen , and is only clearly resolvable when birds are flying near - vertically before landing on a tree trunk ; something the bird in the Luneau video did not do .
2 .
The black trailing edge to the underwing of Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ is often very inconspicuous and may disappear completely .
Due to motion and flexion of the wing , the black trailing edge is much more obvious towards the wingtips .
This produces an apparent plumage pattern that matches the patterns shown by the Luneau video bird ( compare Figure 1B , frames 175 and 457 with Figure 1A , frames 300 and 416 . 7 ) .
In many frames of Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ , a black trailing edge to the wing is discernable ( though due to bleeding of white as a video artifact , it appears narrower than it really is ) .
However , analysis of the bird in the Luneau video in light of images of known Pileated:__entity__ Woodpeckers:__entity__ confirms that a similar black trailing edge to the wing is discernable in some frames of the Luneau video ( compare Figure 1B , frame 775 with Figure 1A , frame 366 . 7 : the apparent plumage patterns are similar , and inconsistent with Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ ) .
It is argued here that the hypothesis put forward in Sibley et al [ 4 ] is correct , and that the black trailing edge of the underwing of Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ can indeed , due to flexion of the wings during the downstroke , be misinterpreted as the black leading edge and wingtips of the upperwing of an Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ .
3 .
Figure 3 shows that the plumage patterns shown by the Luneau bird , throughout several wingbeat cycles , are compatible with Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ .
The three plumage features described in Sibley et al [ 4 ] that are incompatible with Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ ( black secondary feathers on upper surface of left wing , brighter white primary bases , and a black band curling round the wing tip ) are seen consistently in the Luneau video and are recapitulated throughout the video of Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ .
Discussion
Evidence is presented here to show that the distinctive plumage features of Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ are surprisingly difficult to resolve in poor - quality video of birds in escape flight away from the camera , and that they can show apparent plumage patterns that might more readily be associated with Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ .
Irrespective of the identity of the bird in the Luneau video , this knowledge will be critical to assessment of further claims of Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpeckers:__entity__ during the current intensive search effort .
It is , however , suggested here that critical frames used for identification of the Luneau video woodpecker as an Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ are also consistent with Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ .
The wingbeat frequency of the bird in the Luneau video is also perhaps consistent with Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ , at least for short periods of flight .
Analysis of the videos of Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ has supported the hypothesised interpretations of key frames of the Luneau video by Sibley et al [ 4 ] .
Although the rebuttal of that comment in Fitzpatrick et al [ 5 ] asserted that flexion and motion of wings of Pileated:__entity__ Woodpeckers:__entity__ could not produce the images seen in the Luneau video , it has been shown here that they can .
The Luneau video as presented in Fitzpatrick et al [ 1 ] , shows features that are consistent with Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ , and inconsistent with Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ .
It is argued in this paper that , in fact , the black trailing edge of the wing of a Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ is seen clearly in the Luneau video , during the downstroke of the wingbeat cycle , but that it has been misinterpreted as black wingtips ( Figure 1 , 2 , 3 ) .
A fuller analysis of the Luneau video by the Cornell University team is presented online [ 7 ] .
Although it is not peer - reviewed , the points this article makes should be taken into account .
The authors summarise nine diagnostic traits from their analysis of the Luneau video that identify the bird as Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ .
These are listed and discussed point - by point below .
1 .
' The underwing pattern in flight consistently appears largely white , giving the appearance of having black wingtips but lacking any black along the rear , or trailing edge . '
Data presented in this paper show that this statement is not wholly supported , and in any case the underwing of Pileated:__entity__ Woodpeckers:__entity__ can present the same appearance .
2 .
' The upperwing pattern in flight consistently shows a broad , white trailing edge , with no frames demonstrating the conspicuous dark rear border to be expected of normal Pileated:__entity__ Woodpeckers:__entity__ . '
Notwithstanding that certain frames of the Luneau video ( e . g . frame 350 ) do appear to show a black trailing edge to the upperwing , data presented in this paper shows that , at this angle of view and resolution of video , Pileated:__entity__ Woodpeckers:__entity__ also may fail to show this feature .
This analysis has shown that the hypothesis presented in Sibley et al [ 4 ] is plausible , i . e . that some of the frames interpreted by [ 1 ] to show the upperwing of an Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ may in fact show large amounts of white and the black trailing edge from the underwing of a Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ .
3 .
' The wings are longer relative to the body diameter than in Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ and consistent with the wing shape of Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ . '
Fitzpatrick et al [ 5 ] agreed that accurate measurements were not possible from the video images presented in their original paper [ 1 ] , and it seems unlikely that much confidence can be placed in the wing - length measurements of the bird in the Luneau video .
Comparison of , for example , Figure 1A , frame 283 . 3 with Figure 1B , frame 578 suggests that any differences will be very difficult to prove .
4 .
' Reenactment of the scene using life - sized , realistically painted , dynamically flapping models produced images remarkably similar to those of the Luneau video using the Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ model , and images clearly identifiable as Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ using a model of that species . '
Interpretation of model re - enactments is hampered by the fact that the stiff , flat - winged models cannot reflect the wing flexion and curvature of real birds .
Reenactment of the scene using real Pileated:__entity__ Woodpeckers:__entity__ has produced images remarkably similar to the Luneau video .
5 .
' The wingbeat frequency is 8 . 6 beats per second , which is almost identical to that recorded for Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ ( as documented by one acoustic record from 1935 ) .
The wing - beat frequencies of Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ are not known to exceed 7 . 5 beats per second , and more typically range between 3 and 6 beats per second . '
The fact that in only four recorded escape flights of Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ , two were recorded for which the initial escape flight wingbeat frequency ( 8 . 0 s - 1 and 8 . 6 s - 1 ) exceeded that previously recorded for this species shows that previous datasets were too limited to make this conclusion .
Birds flap more rapidly at take off to gain altitude and speed than they do in sustained level flight : Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ flight data in the literature [ 1 , 4 , 5 ] was derived from the work of Tobalske [ 8 ] , which explicitly excluded the initial take - off period , and therefore cannot be used to support the elimination of Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ in the Luneau video .
Furthermore , the bird in the Luneau video is consistently gaining height from a low position above water and , whatever its species , might be expected to flap more rapidly than if it were in level flight .
Tanner [ 9 ] noted that Pileated:__entity__ Woodpeckers:__entity__ can maintain extended fast direct flight .
He was of the opinion that flight pattern was not a useful character for separating the two species in the field , and that Pileated:__entity__ Woodpeckers:__entity__ frequently fly in a manner that was in no way different to Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpeckers:__entity__ .
The figure of 8 . 6 wingbeats per second for the Luneau bird ( data reanalysed here ) is taken as consistent with Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ on the basis of analysis of a single archival audio recording [ 3 ] .
The Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ in that audio tape is clearly flapping its wings , but without accompanying visual confirmation it is not clear that it is in flight .
In general , larger birds are expected to flap their wings more slowly than smaller birds of comparable wing morphology .
Tobalske [ 8 ] showed that , across species , smaller woodpeckers tend to flap more quickly than larger ones , and that there was considerable intraspecific variation .
The assertion that Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpeckers:__entity__ flap their wings more quickly than Pileated:__entity__ Woodpeckers:__entity__ is therefore counterintuitive .
Further comment is conjecture : while the flight pattern and wing posture of the bird in the Luneau video may be unusual , it has not been shown that it is outside the range of variability of Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ , and cannot therefore be used to eliminate the possibility that it was the commoner species .
6 .
' White plumage on the back is visible on the retreating bird as it begins to gain altitude .
Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ has white on the back ; Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ has entirely black back . '
This was discussed by Sibley et al [ 4 ] , who argued that the images thought to show white on the dorsum were too small to be accepted uncritically .
In all the frames of the Luneau video that appear to show white on the dorsum , the bird is distant ( dorsal white is not visible on the higher resolution images earlier in the video ) and partially obscured , making it difficult to distinguish dorsum from wing .
Spurious areas of white pixels appear as artifacts in both videos .
Nevertheless , this remains the best evidence that the Luneau bird was not a standard Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ .
7 .
' The dorsal view of the right wing as it begins to unfold shows a triangle of white that matches in size and position the white on the folded wing of an Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ beginning to launch into flight . '
No further comment is provided here .
An alternative explanation was offered by Sibley et al [ 4 ] and rebutted by Fitzpatrick et al [ 5 ] .
The statement requires a degree of certainty about the position of the wing .
( 8 ) ' The distance between the wrist area and the tip of the tail ( 32 - 36 cm , as measured when the bird begins to take flight ) is comparable to known measurements of Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ and considerably larger than even the largest Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ we measured . '
As stated under ( 3 ) , above , there is general agreement that accurate measurements are not possible from the Luneau video because too many uncontrolled variables are involved [ 4 , 5 ] .
9 .
' Only 20 seconds before the woodpecker flees , a bird with the size and color pattern of an Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ was perched within 3 m of the site from which the woodpecker took flight . '
This would be a strong argument if it could be shown that the object in question was a bird and not , as is now apparently thought likely , a section of branch or tree stump [ 10 ] .
The Luneau video reveals several white triangular patches apparently visible on or around tree trunks , most or all of which must therefore be images of tree topography or video artifacts .
This was discussed in the literature ( see [ 4 , 5 ] ) .
Central to the identification of the flying bird seen in the Luneau video was the evidence that plumage and flight patterns were inconsistent with Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ .
A very basic video analysis presented here has suggested that this may not be the case , and that further research is needed .
Any identification of the bird in the Luneau video as an Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ bill:__entity__ must take into account the data presented here and in Sibley et al [ 4 ] , which shows it is largely consistent with Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ and points out apparent inconsistencies with Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ .
This does not of course necessarily imply that the Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ is extinct , nor indeed entirely rule out the possibility that the bird in the Luneau video was one .
There appears to be no reason to question the anecdotal sight records of Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ presented in Fitzpatrick et al [ 1 ] ( or in many online sources ) , because some of them appear credible , albeit brief .
Audio evidence has since been published [ 11 ] although this too is far from conclusive .
However , to regard the Luneau video by itself as presenting anything other than an unidentified woodpecker falls below the standards of proof normally required for scientific publication : the images are not good enough .
The Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ may persist in continental North America , and there is enough anecdotal evidence to make this a possibility , but the Luneau video does not support the case .
The balance of evidence would suggest that the bird in the Luneau video is more likely to have been a Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ , but the search for Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ should continue .
While this paper was under review , a report of sight records and sound recordings of Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpeckers:__entity__ was published from a location in Florida [ 12 ] .
This very exciting claim is strengthened by reports of sighting of the white dorsal stripes on one bird in flight .
Unfortunately , several sightings were made without optical aids and cannot be considered proven .
The ' kent ' calls recorded from the Florida location are spectrographically similar to the ' bleat ' calls of young White:__entity__ -:__entity__ tailed:__entity__ Deer:__entity__ , as described in Richardson et al [ 13 ] .
A clear photograph will be required from this location too before the presence of Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpeckers:__entity__ can be considered confirmed .
It is hoped that this paper will help with assessment of any further low quality photographs or videos .
Conclusion
Flight and plumage patterns of the putative Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ recorded in Arkansas in 2005 are recapitulated by confirmed Pileated:__entity__ Woodpeckers:__entity__ .
The bird in the Arkansas video is best regarded as not fully identified , and is probably a Pileated:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ .
Methods
Video recording
Pileated:__entity__ Woodpeckers:__entity__ were attracted to a bird feeder containing suet at Grants Trail , Dayton , OH 45459 .
The suet feeder was placed approximately 2 . 1 m high on a tree trunk , and the distance to the suet feeder from the observation point was approximately 5 m .
Birds on the feeder were startled by movement of window blinds on January 28 and February 5 , 2006 , and their escape flights were filmed using a Sony Hi - 8 SteadyShot video camera at 29 . 97 frames s - 1 .
At least two birds feature in the videos , male and female .
Analogue tape was converted to digital by connecting the Hi - 8 camera directly to a Sony DCR - HC30 digital video camera and recording onto that camera ' s mini dv cassette .
The resulting images were converted to an avi file using Windows Movie Maker on a Windows XP PC .
The video is freely available in wmv format [ 14 ] and in avi format from the author or David Nolin ( via the author ) .
The video was decompiled using Blaze Media Pro ( Mystik Media , Hampstead , NC , USA ) for a detailed analysis .
Import into Avid (R) Xpress Pro HD for deinterlacing did not reduce the wing flicker seen in the images , and further professional processing could not improve the resolution , so the original decompiled file was used for analysis .
Hence some frames contain two overlaid images , which may lower the resolution in some cases .
The decompiled file was examined frame by frame and compared to the decompiled images of the putative Ivory:__entity__ -:__entity__ billed:__entity__ Woodpecker:__entity__ presented in Fitzpatrick et al [ 1 ] .
Wingbeat frequencies were calculated by noting the frame number of the midpoint of the downstroke of each wingbeat ( e . g . Figure 1B , frame 758 ) and calculating the length of time taken per wingbeat as ( number of frames between downstroke midpoints ) / 29 . 97 .

A global gene evolution analysis on Vibrionaceae family using phylogenetic profile
Abstract
Background
Vibrionaceae represent a significant portion of the cultivable heterotrophic sea bacteria ; they strongly affect nutrient cycling and some species are devastating pathogens .
In this work we propose an improved phylogenetic profile analysis on 14 Vibrionaceae genomes , to study the evolution of this family on the basis of gene content .
The phylogenetic profile is based on the observation that genes involved in the same process ( e . g . metabolic pathway or structural complex ) tend to be concurrently present or absent within different genomes .
This allows the prediction of hypothetical functions on the basis of a shared phylogenetic profiles .
Moreover this approach is useful to identify putative laterally transferred elements on the basis of their presence on distantly phylogenetically related bacteria .
Results
Vibrionaceae ORFs were aligned against all the available bacterial proteomes .
Phylogenetic profile is defined as an array of distances , based on aminoacid substitution matrixes , from single genes to all their orthologues .
Final phylogenetic profiles , derived from non - redundant list of all ORFs , was defined as the median of all the profiles belonging to the cluster .
The resulting phylogenetic profiles matrix contains gene clusters on the rows and organisms on the columns .
Cluster analysis identified groups of " core genes " with a widespread high similarity across all the organisms and several clusters that contain genes homologous only to a limited set of organisms .
On each of these clusters , COG class enrichment has been calculated .
The analysis reveals that clusters of core genes have the highest number of enriched classes , while the others are enriched just for few of them like DNA replication , recombination and repair .
Conclusion
We found that mobile elements have heterogeneous profiles not only across the entire set of organisms , but also within Vibrionaceae ; this confirms their great influence on bacteria evolution even inside the same family .
Furthermore , several hypothetical proteins highly correlate with mobile elements profiles suggesting a possible horizontal transfer mechanism for the evolution of these genes .
Finally , we suggested the putative role of some ORFs having an unknown function on the basis of their phylogenetic profile similarity to well characterized genes .
Background
Over the past ten years , a great number of microbial genomes have been sequenced covering a wide representation of prokaryots as well as multiple strains of some species .
The study of these genomes both by computational and experimental approaches has highly improved our understanding on physiology , phylogenetic relationship and pathogenicity of many organisms .
Furthermore , it has provided new knowledge on microbial genome evolution , revealing a gene core shared by the great majority of bacteria , genes characteristic of particular groups and " novel " genes that possibly originated by lateral gene transfer from some unknown source .
Analysis performed on closely related genomes revealed that a substantial fraction of genes in any genome seem to be strain specific .
These genes might sometime arise by gene duplication followed by a rapid divergence , or by lineage - specific loss of genes in one strain , resulting in a unique gene in other strains .
However , there are several lines of evidence indicating that lateral gene transfer may be the main mechanism to acquire novel genes .
Indeed , this could be one of the main forces driving bacterial adaptation and evolution .
Phage DNA is thought to be one of the main vectors for lateral gene transfer among bacteria [ 1 ] and many virulence factors from bacterial pathogen are phage encoded [ 2 ] .
For example , the genes for CT , the most important virulence factor of V:__entity__ .:__entity__ cholerae:__entity__ , are encoded in the genome of phage CTX phi , integrated in the bacterial chromosome 1 .
Since lateral gene transfer plays a relevant role in bacterial evolution , the reconstruction of phylogeny is very complex and phylogenetic trees built by standard sequence analysis may not lead to a reliable picture of the evolutionary history .
In fact , alternative trees can be obtained when different proteins are considered .
For many aspects the classification of bacteria on the basis of their global gene content may give a better description of their evolutionary history .
This may be particularly important when bacteria of the same group are compared , since newly acquired genes could be relevant to confer peculiar features that allows the exploitation of different ecological niches .
In this study we propose a bioinformatic procedure to investigate bacterial genome evolution , taking into account the global gene content , as well as sequence similarity .
We based our analysis on modified phylogenetic profiles [ 3 ] ; however , we do not consider only the presence / absence of orthologue genes , but also their distance , based on a substitution matrix .
A phylogenetic profile is a non - sequence - homology - based method developed to infer a possible functional relationship between genes .
It is based on the idea that proteins that are involved in the same metabolic pathway or structural complex are likely to evolve in a correlate fashion and during evolution appear phylogenetically linked , showing a tendency to be either preserved or eliminated as a whole .
Therefore , genes showing similar phylogenetic profiles are likely to be functionally related .
We extended the use of phylogenetic profiles to produce an evolutionary tree based on a hierarchical clusterization of organisms with similar phylogenetic profiles .
For this study we took the whole gene dataset of 320 prokaryotic genomes , however , we limited the analysis to the orthologous groups that are present in at least one of the 14 considered species of the Vibrionaceae family .
These bacteria belong to the Gammaproteobacteria group and are highly abundant in aquatic environment , they strongly influence nutrient cycling and various species are also devastating pathogens .
Since we focused our analysis on this particular group , the aim of this study is not the construction of a global evolutionary tree , but rather a Vibrionaceae perspective of bacterial diversity , based on phylogenetic profiles .
Results and discussion
Phylogenetic matrix
The analysis was performed on 14 bacteria belonging to the Vibrionaceae family ( Table 1 ) .
The redundant list of Vibrionaceae ORFs was clustered to reduce the number of proteins to analyze and the phylogenetic profile for each cluster was calculated as described in the Method section .
Many authors proposed and successfully applied different measure methods to calculate the phylogenetic profile values .
Pellegrini et al .
[ 3 ] firstly proposed a phylogenetic profile described as a string of bits , each bit representing the absence or presence of an homologous gene in a given genome .
This method lacks a weighting procedure , giving the same weight ( value 1 ) to all the sequences that are considered homologous given a similarity threshold .
Enault and colleagues proposed an improved phylogenetic profile based on a normalized Blastp bit score [ 4 ] .
This method , compared to the approach implemented by Pellegrini , allows weighting each point of the profile proportionally to the length and the quality of the alignment .
Jingchun and colleagues optimized the phylogenetic profiles method by integrating phylogenetic relationships among reference organisms and sequence homology information , based on E - value score , to improve prediction accuracy [ 5 ] .
The measure index I proposed in this work is similar to the others described above , taking into account both the quality and the length of the alignment using a substitution matrix .
Moreover our approach considers also the total length of the sequences , penalizing good alignments occurring between ORFs having different lengths and taking into consideration that ORFs could differentiate mainly for the presence of functional domains .
The final phylogenetic profile for each cluster was defined as the median of all the profiles belonging to the cluster , named " meta - profile " , which describes the profile of conserved ORFs belonging to an entire family .
Hierarchical cluster analysis
A hierarchical cluster analysis was performed on the entire phylogenetic profile matrix and it was calculated a statistical support based on bootstrap method for the nodes of the columns tree ( Fig 1 ) .
The branch tree colors represent the bootstrap percentage support .
This constitutes a phylogenetic tree based on gene content using Vibrionaceae ORFs as a reference .
Genomes belonging to the same taxonomic group tend to cluster together and the Vibrionaceae species are closely related .
As expected , according to the Vibrionaceae branch lengths it is evident that variability within this group is higher compared to the other groups .
The dataset used for phylogenetic matrix calculation is indeed composed by Vibrionaceae ORFs .
This implies that the similarity measures between these ORFs and the corresponding orthologues will be nearly zero in most of the other species and significantly higher in the Vibrionaceae family , increasing the variability into this group .
Moreover the average percentage of clusters shared by the Vibrionaceae members is only 47 . 5 % ( average number of shared clusters divided by the total number of clusters ) that again indicates a high variability inside this family .
It is also interesting to note that organisms belonging to the same or closely related taxa split into different subgroups .
This highlights the existence of a high variability among lineages , due to genetic and evolutionary processes such as lateral gene transfer , concerted evolution and gene duplication [ 6 ] .
In terms of gene content , the organisms more related to the Vibrionaceae belong to the gamma and beta proteobacteria .
In particular Altermonadales , Enterobacteriales and Burkholderiales are closely related to Vibrionaceae , and share the higher number of cluster of genes ( average percentage of 20 % ) .
As expected , Archea are the most distant group sharing just 3 . 8 % of clusters .
Clusters and genes distribution , as shown in Fig 2 , reveals that the number of clusters and genes shared by the organisms decreases as the number of organisms considered increases .
The analysis was performed considering for each cluster profile the number of organisms sharing the same numbers of clusters ( and genes ) .
The majority of gene cluster groups no more than 21 species on a total of 320 .
The highest blue spike corresponds to the higher number of genes shared by 105 groups of 14 organisms .
Among these groups , as expected , Vibrionaceae are highly represented .
Other species represented are Colwellia:__entity__ psychrerythraea:__entity__ 34H:__entity__ and Shewanella:__entity__ oneidensis:__entity__ , that belong to the Alteromonadales family .
The cluster analysis performed on genes is shown in Fig .
3 .
From now on , to avoid confusing interpretation between clusters derived from the cluster analysis and cluster derived from the ORFs clustering we will use the term " gene " in place of cluster of ORFs .
The different gradient of color , from bright to dark red , represents decreasing similarity values .
The cluster analysis allows the detection of three main groups of genes .
The first one ( Fig 3 , panel B ) contains the most conserved and established genes shared almost by all the organisms .
These core genes can be defined as the set of all genes shared as orthologous by all members of an evolutionary coherent group .
In our analysis we identify four clusters , for a total of 145 genes , shared by all the 320 organisms .
The ORFs belonging to these clusters are predicted to codify for the ATP binding subunit of ABC transporters ( annotated as ABC - type polar amino acid transport system , ABC - type antimicrobial peptide transport system , ABC - type histidine transport system and ABC - type transport system involved in lysophospholipase L1 biosynthesis ) .
This finding is surprising since this is the first report where these ORFs are assigned to the core genes .
Anyway two different explanations can be traced .
First , it is known that the ABC transporters represent an essential transport system in the prokaryotes and that their ATP binding subunits are apparently overrepresented compared to the other two subunits ( ligand binding and permease subunit ) in all genomes sequenced thus far [ 7 ] .
Second , one organism , Buchnera:__entity__ aphidicola:__entity__ , presents these genes with a similarity just below the cut - off used for the analysis , but they have been considered since it is well known that in this mutualistic endosymbiont the accelerated evolution and AT bias affect all its genes , including the 16S rRNA [ 8 , 9 ] .
The dataset used for the analysis includes genomes in draft quality ( Vibrio:__entity__ cholerae:__entity__ 0395:__entity__ , Vibrio:__entity__ cholerae:__entity__ MO10:__entity__ , Vibrio:__entity__ cholerae:__entity__ RC385:__entity__ , Vibrio:__entity__ cholerae:__entity__ V51:__entity__ , Vibrio:__entity__ cholerae:__entity__ V52:__entity__ , Photobacterium:__entity__ profundum:__entity__ 3TCK:__entity__ , Vibrio:__entity__ MED222:__entity__ , Vibrio:__entity__ splendidus12B01:__entity__ ) .
Wrong ORFs prediction or missing genes due to incomplete genome sequences can explain the low number of core genes identified .
To avoid such problems we repeated the analysis excluding the draft genomes and thus considering 312 genomes .
The results , reported in Table 2 , show an increased number of the core genes and in particular ribosomal proteins and tRNA synthetase , as reported by Charlesbois and Doolittle [ 10 ] .
This could be considered as a sort of " minimal genome " containing the group of genes that are necessary to maintain a free - living organism .
The low number of genes shared by all the organisms can be due to many factors .
First of all we used the Vibrionaceae ORFs as a reference , limiting the number of genes we were able to identify .
It was further demonstrated that the core gene size decreases as more genome sequences are analyzed [ 10 ] .
Genes that are considered to belong to the core set when close organisms are compared , are classified as flexible genes when distantly related genomes are analyzed [ 6 ] .
Finally , genes within core genomes might be transferred or replaced , introducing new versions of existing genes into genomes .
Such transfers can replace even highly conserved genes by non - homologous counterparts but the advantages provided are difficult to explain .
It is also to take into consideration that many symbiotic and parasitic bacteria undergo a reduction of their genomes , loosing many genes required by free - living cell .
The second group ( Fig 3 , panel C ) represents genes shared mainly among Vibrionaceae and other gamma proteobacteria ( as Altermonadales , Burkholderiales and Enterobactidiales ) .
Finally , the third group ( Fig . 3 , panel D ) is composed by genes that are mainly specific to the Vibrionaceae .
k - mean cluster analysis and cluster enrichment
We performed a k - means cluster analysis , setting the k value to 14 .
As shown in Fig .
4 , the clusters 3 , 4 , 11 , 13 and 14 contain the higher percentage of genes , accounting for more that 50 % of the total genes , while clusters 9 and 10 contain the lower number of ORFs ( 3 % of genes ) .
The variance in each k - means cluster is very low ( Fig . 4 ) , meaning that the clusters contain genes with compact and similar profiles .
As described in Fig .
4 , the majority of the clusters ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 9 , 12 , 13 ) contains genes with a similar profile , with the average values ( red line ) near zero , except for the presence of some spikes correspondent to an increasing similarity with some isolated organisms .
As shown in Table 3 , clusters 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and 9 contains genes that have a high similarity in a small subset of organisms .
The majority of these ORFs are annotated as hypothetical proteins or phage related proteins .
Clusters 8 , 10 and 14 present genes shared among almost all the organisms .
In particular cluster 10 is composed by the core genes described before having an high value of similarity widespread among all the organisms ; cluster 8 contains genes shared mainly by gamma proteobacteria and cluster 14 is composed of genes in common between Vibrionaceae and Enterobacteriaceae .
A functional annotation has been performed on each gene cluster using COG ( Cluster of Orthologous Genes ) , KEGG pathway map and GO databases .
For each k - mean cluster the enrichment probability with respect to the total number of clusters has been obtained with the hypergeometric distribution .
Fig .
5 shows COG enrichment results for each cluster .
As expected clusters represented by conserved genes ( cluster 8 , 10 and 14 ) have the higher number of enriched COG codes , while cluster specific of few organisms are characterized by a small number of enriched COGs .
The majority of clusters presents COG codes enrichment for S ( function unknown ) , R ( poorly characterized ) and - ( absence of COG code ) categories .
This is due to the large abundance of unknown and hypothetical proteins presents in the Vibrionaceae proteomes .
It is worth noting that cluster 3 , mainly represented by Photobacterium:__entity__ profundum:__entity__ SS9:__entity__ ORFs , is enriched only by C ( Energy production and conversion ) , L ( DNA replication , recombination and repair ) and M ( Cell envelope biogenesis , outer membrane ) .
Probably the L class overrepresentation is determined by the high number of transposons that are present in the SS9 genome [ 11 ] .
The role played by these transposable elements in the survival of this deep - sea bacterium it is still a matter of debate [ 12 ] .
In addition V:__entity__ .:__entity__ vulnificus:__entity__ YJ016:__entity__ and V:__entity__ .:__entity__ vulnificus:__entity__ CMCP6:__entity__ ( cluster 13 ) seem to share genes belonging to the enriched COG classes K ( Transcription ) , L and T ( Signal transduction mechanisms ) .
It was previously reported an enrichment in genes belonging to the transcription class in the genome of V:__entity__ .:__entity__ vulnificus:__entity__ respect to the V:__entity__ .:__entity__ cholerae:__entity__ genome [ 13 ] .
This class is clearly related to the T class and seems to indicate that this organism is able to receive and translate in a transcriptional response specific environmental signals .
Despite this , the large majority of the genes in clusters 3 and 13 lacks COG annotation .
Cluster 7 , as shown in Table 3 , accounts organisms with large genome size ( see Table 1 ) .
This can explain the fact the this cluster contains almost all the COG class enriched and suggests a more complex and flexible life - style of these organisms compared to the other Vibrionaceae members .
KEGG annotation is limited to metabolic or structural complex network and so a reduced number of genes have a KEGG entry .
This causes the presence of clusters without enriched map ( cluster 2 - 5 , 7 , 13 , see Fig 5 ) .
Also in this case , the clusters presenting the higher number of significant KEGG map are those containing the conserved genes .
The most enriched KEGG clusters are cluster 14 , 10 and 8 accounting for the majority of the metabolic pathways .
Cluster 1 is enriched for map3080 ( type IV secretion system ) .
In fact V:__entity__ .:__entity__ fischeri:__entity__ genome contains 10 separate pilus gene clusters , including eight type - IV pilus loci .
The presence of multiple pilus gene clusters suggests that different pili may be expressed in different environments or during multiple stages of its development as a symbiont [ 14 ] .
Cluster 11 is enriched for map3090 ( type II secretion system ) .
The type II pathway is conserved among gram - negative bacteria , including many pathogens , and secretes a variety of virulence factors and degradative enzymes [ 15 ] .
Cluster 9 is enriched for map 00860 ( Porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism ) .
These genes are involved in the cobalamin ( coenzyme B12 ) biosynthetic pathway [ 16 ] .
Some organisms , such as Salmonella:__entity__ typhimurium:__entity__ and Klebsiella:__entity__ pneumoniae:__entity__ , can synthesize cobalamin de novo [ 17 ] , while E:__entity__ .:__entity__ coli:__entity__ and large part of the Vibrionaceae perform cobalamin biosynthesis only when provided with cobinamide .
It is interesting to observe that the genes belonging to the de novo pathway are only shared by Archea , some other organisms like Salmonella , Pseudomonas and Vibrio:__entity__ MED222:__entity__ .
Finally cluster 6 is enriched by map2010 ( ABC transporter ) , map2020 ( two - component system ) , map2030 and map2031 ( bacterial chemotaxis ) , map2040 ( Flagellar assembly ) and map3090 ( type II secretion system ) .
This cluster contains genes shared with a high similarity by all Vibrio and with a lower similarity with Photobacterium:__entity__ profundum:__entity__ species .
Among the Vibrio species the organisms showing the highest similarity ( Tab . 3 ) are V:__entity__ .:__entity__ cholerae:__entity__ strains .
Vibrionaceae specific genes
We identify 1940 clusters specific to the Vibrionaceae .
All the Vibrionaceae considered in the analysis share 108 clusters .
Among these genes we identify ToxR and ToxS genes .
ToxR gene encodes a transmembrane regulatory protein firstly identified in V:__entity__ .:__entity__ cholerae:__entity__ , in which it co - ordinates many virulence factors in response to several environmental parameters [ 18 ] .
V:__entity__ .:__entity__ cholerae:__entity__ ToxR activity is enhanced by a second transmembrane protein , ToxS , encoded downstream toxR [ 19 ] .
This family of proteins is involved in response to temperature , pH , osmolarity and in Photobacterium:__entity__ profundum:__entity__ SS9:__entity__ , a piezophilic bacterium , to hydrostatic pressure [ 20 ] .
The widespread presence of these genes among the Vibrionaceae suggests their importance in regulatory mechanisms .
We identify two other noteworthy groups of genes composed by 257 and 160 genes respectively shared just by two strains , mainly annotated as " hypothetical protein " .
The first group of genes is shared between Photobacterium:__entity__ profundum:__entity__ SS9:__entity__ and Photobacterium:__entity__ profundum:__entity__ 3TCK:__entity__ , while the second is shared between V:__entity__ .:__entity__ vulnificus:__entity__ CMCP6:__entity__ and YJ016:__entity__ .
These strains are closely related and this explains the high number of shared genes ; while , inside the Vibrionaceae family , the number of specific shared genes highly decreases , showing a high inter - species variability ( Fig . 6 )
Prophages and transposases
Prophages recover different biological roles both as quantitatively important genetic elements of the bacterial chromosome , and as vectors of lateral gene transfer among bacteria , due to their characters of mobile DNA elements .
Indeed , numerous virulence factors from bacterial pathogens are phage encoded .
It was postulated that this role of prophages is not limited to pathogenic bacteria but some adaptations of nonpathogenic strains to their ecological niche might also be mediated by prophages acquisition [ 21 ] .
To better understand the importance of mobile elements within Vibrionaceae family , we performed a hierarchical cluster analysis using gene profiles annotated as " phage protein " and " transposase " , for a total of 172 clusters of genes ( Fig 7 ) .
We found that a high inter - strain genetic variability exists and phages and transposases are both shared by almost all Vibrionaceae , and specific to just some organisms .
We identified five major clusters of mobile elements that are specific to a single organism .
A group composed by 26 clusters containing both transposase and phage proteins seem to be unique to V:__entity__ .:__entity__ splendiduds:__entity__ 12B01:__entity__ ( Fig 7 ) .
Another one composed by 16 clusters is specific of V:__entity__ .:__entity__ vulnificus:__entity__ CMCP6:__entity__ ( Fig 7 ) while V:__entity__ .:__entity__ parahaemoliticus:__entity__ has a cluster of 11 genes ( Fig 7 ) .
Moreover there is another group of transposases and phage genes shared mainly by V:__entity__ .:__entity__ cholerae:__entity__ 0395 , Shewanella:__entity__ oneidensis:__entity__ and V:__entity__ .:__entity__ cholerae:__entity__ V51 ( Fig 7 ) .
Finally a big cluster of almost 30 genes , all predicted to codify for transposases , was found in P:__entity__ .:__entity__ profundum:__entity__ SS9:__entity__ genome ( Fig . 7 ) .
The high presence of transposases in this bacterium seems to correlate with its deep - sea habitat , a feature presumably shared with other deep - sea microorganisms [ 12 ] .
As shown in Fig 7 , many of the clusters well conserved in an organism , are partially shared with a low similarity by other organisms .
This agrees with the idea that prophages are not maintained in the genome over a long period of time and part of their genes may be deleted from the chromosome .
Moreover , microarray analysis and PCR scanning demonstrated that prophages are frequently strain specific within a given bacterial species [ 22 - 24 ] .
According to the modular theory of phage evolution , phage genomes are mosaics of modules , groups of genes functionally related , that are free to recombine in genetic exchanges between distinct phages infecting the same cell [ 21 ] .
This can result in the occurrences of different part of phage distributed in far related genomes .
Phylogenetic profile of some transposases is similar to the phage ones , suggesting a possible transfer mechanism phage - mediated for such mobile elements .
Conclusion
In this work we propose an improved phylogenetic profile analysis on 14 Vibrionaceae genomes , to study this family on the basis of gene content .
Using a phylogenetic profile for each cluster of genes defined as the median of all the profiles belonging to the cluster ( meta - profile ) we investigate the evolution of groups of ORFs belonging to the entire family .
A two - way cluster analysis allows us to identify similarity structures on the entire phylogenetic matrix composed by 8 , 239 clusters of genes and 320 organisms .
The phylogenetic tree obtained with the cluster analysis does not reflect the global evolutionary tree because of the Vibrionaceae ORFs dataset used for the analysis , but rather can be considered as the Vibrionaceae perspective of bacterial diversity .
The phylogenetic tree reflects the evolutionary processes that shape genomes , as lateral gene transfer , genes genesis and loss .
In this context , the tree allows to group together genomes on the base of their global gene content .
We found that genomes belonging to the same taxonomic group tend to cluster together and that Vibrionaceae species are closely related .
Moreover organisms belonging to the same or closely related taxa split into different subgroups , confirming the existence of a high variability among lineages , due to genetic and evolutionary process such as lateral gene transfer , concerted evolution and genes duplication .
On the other hand several groups of genes characterised by different homogeneous profiles have been identified .
In particular we found , 1 ) a set of conserved genes ( with a high similarity values across all organisms ) that reflects the " minimal genome " composition defined in other previous works ; 2 ) a set of genes mainly shared by Vibrionaceae and other Gamma proteobacteria and 3 ) genes specific to different sets of Vibrionaceae .
Finally a further analysis on prophage and transposase has confirmed the high inter - strain genetic variability even among closely related species .
The increasing number of genomes included in this type of analysis surely add new sorces of variability and noise , anyway we think that the use of meta - profiles can be useful for complexity reduction and data analysis to study global gene evolution .

Similarity search and phylogenetic profile construction
All the Vibrionaceae ORFs were merged generating a redundant list of 59 , 669 proteins and were compared to all open reading frame from 320 bacterial and archeal genomes using Blastp .
To determine the presence of an orthologous we used a combination of three different thresholds ; a similarity value equal to or higher than 30 % , an alignment length equal or higher than 70 % and an Evalue score lower than or equal to e - 6 .
After determining the presence of an orthologous gene , we computed a similarity index I for each pair of orthologous ( a point of the phylogenetic profile ) as follow :
I = SqsSqq . min ( lq , ls ) max ( lq , ls )

where lq and ls are the query and subject length sequence respectively and Sqs is the similarity score between the query and the subject sequence .
Sqs is defined as follow :
Sqs = sum i = 1M alpha Aqi , Asi + GP

where M is the match length between the query and subject sequence ; Aqi and Asi respectively the query and subject amino acid in position i ; alpha the BLOSUM substitution matrix value for amino acid pair Aqi , Asi and GP the gap penalty .
GP is defined as follow :
GP = GOP + GEP ( k - 1 )
where GOP is the Gap Open Penalty set to - 11 , GEP the Gap Extension Penalty set to - 1 and k the gap length .
Sqq represents the score of the self - aligned query sequence .
Sqs is always smaller than Sqq and the score S range between 0 and 1 .
In order to take into account also the different sequence lengths , we multiplied the score S by the ratio between the minimum length between query and subject and the maximum length between query and subjects .
In this way the total score is weighted on the base of the length , resulting in a lower similarity value if the lengths of the sequences are different .
The phylogenetic profile for each ORF is an array of index I with length equal to the number of genomes considered ( 320 ) .
ORFs clustering
The redundant list of 59 , 669 Vibrionaceae ORFs contained multiple copies of the same genes due to the presence of conserved genes in the considered genomes .
In order to reduce the redundancy , we clustered proteins using a two - step approach .
The first step is based on COG ( Cluster of Othologous Genes ) annotation .
COG classifies conserved genes according to their homologous relationships .
All the Vibrionaceae ORFs were annotated using COG clusters and proteins sharing the same COG code were considered belonging to the same cluster .
In particular , the annotation process consists of a similarity search of all the ORFs against the COG proteins using blast and considering the best hit for each protein .
43 , 024 ORFs presented a similarity with a COG entry , producing 2 , 463 different clusters .
In the second step , the remaining 16 , 645 ORFs without similarity with any COG entry were clustered using CD - HIT software [ 26 ] .
CD - HIT program clusters protein sequence database at high sequence identity threshold and efficiently removes high sequence redundancy .
This last clustering process produced 9 , 613 different groups of similar proteins .
Finally from the 12 , 076 total clusters obtained by this methodology , those composed by ORFs that do not have any ortologous genes ( with a phylogenetic profile composed by an array with all zero values except for one position match with itself ) were eliminated , resulting in a dataset composed by 8 , 239 distinct clusters .
The final phylogenetic profile for each cluster ( meta - profile ) was defined as the median of all the profiles belonging to the cluster .
At the end of these procedures the final phylogenetic matrix was composed by 8 , 239 rows ( cluster of genes ) and 320 columns ( organisms ) .
In each cell the median of the index in the cluster was reported .
Cluster analysis
Several clustering techniques have been used to identify the similarity structure underneath our data .
A k - means and a two - way hierarchical cluster analysis with Euclidean distance and complete linkage were performed on the phylogenetic matrix .
The goal of a cluster analysis is to partition the elements into subsets without any constrains or a priori information , so that two criteria are satisfied : homogeneity , elements inside a cluster are highly similar to each other ; and separation , elements from different clusters have low similarity to each other .
The Figure of Merit ( FOM ) is a measure of fit of the expression patterns for the clusters produced by a particular algorithm that estimates the predictive power of a clustering algorithm .
It is computed by removing each sample in turn from the data set , clustering genes based on the remaining data , and calculating the fit of the withheld sample to the clustering pattern obtained from the other samples .
On our data FOM analysis identified the best number of k - means clusters between 10 and 15 .
We decided to set k ( in the k - means analysis ) equal to 14 .
In each of these 14 clusters subsequent hierarchical cluster analysis was performed with bootstrap cluster assessment .
All the previous analyses were performed with TMEV software [ 27 ] , freely available at [ 28 ] .
Enrichment categories
Each cluster of genes has been annotated according to COG code , GO terms and KEGG pathway maps .
Class enrichment ( with respect to the entire matrix ) has been calculated according to the hypergeometric distribution that was used to obtain the chance probability of observing the number of genes annotated with a particular COG , GO and KEGG category among the selected cluster .
The probability P of observing at least k genes of a functional category within a group of n genes is given by :
P = sum i = kn ( fi ) ( g - fn - i ) ( gn )

A secondary structural common core in the ribosomal ITS2 ( internal transcribed spacer ) of
Culexspecies from diverse geographical locations
Abstract
In the present study , sequence and structural analysis of ITS2 region ( the spacer segment between 5 . 8S and 28S rRNA of
mature rRNA sequences ) of 7 Culex species belonging to 5 different geographical locations was carried out .
Alignment of the
ITS2 sequence from the 7 species revealed 8 homologous domains .
Four species namely C:__entity__ .:__entity__ vishnui:__entity__ , C:__entity__ .:__entity__ annulus:__entity__ , C:__entity__ .:__entity__ pipiens:__entity__ ,
C:__entity__ .:__entity__ quiquefasciatusshowed:__entity__ high sequence ( 98 - 100 % ) and RNA secondary structure similarity .
The ITS2 similarity among different
species is high despite their varying geographical locations .
Several common features of secondary structure are shared among
these species , with some of them supported by compensatory changes , suggesting the significant role by ITS2 as an RNA domain
during ribosome biogenesis .
Background
Culex mosquito species have been described from a wide range of environments and are involved in pathogen transmission from
human:__entity__ to reservoirs and vice - versa .
[ 1 ] Sequence similarity have been
reported for ITS2 ( the spacer segments between 5 . 8S and 28S rRNA of mature rRNA sequences ) from 5 Culex species of diverse
geographic locations .
[ 3 - 4 -
5 - 9 -
20 ] The ITS spacers are versatile as genetic markers and have been used for the determination of taxonomic
classification .
[ 17 ] Recent functional analyses performed on yeast:__entity__ ribosomal
RNA genes clearly show that the structural integrity of the transcribed spacer regions is an essential prerequisite for the correct
processing of mature rRNA and for the biogenesis of active ribosomal subunits .
[ 2 -
3 ] The derivation of reliable secondary structure models for each transcribed spacer
region would represent a major step towards a detailed understanding of their biological roles .
Comparative sequence analysis provides a powerful tool for identifying biologically relevant folding patterns in RNA molecules .
[ 4 ] This involves collection of sequences exhibiting substantial nucleotide
differences while retaining unequivocal sequence similarity .
However , a high degree of sequence variation in the transcribed
spacers is known even among closely related species .
[ 5 - 6 - 7 ] Here , we analyze ITS2 from 7
Culex species characteristic of 5 different geographical locations to assemble common RNA structural features .
Methodology
Dataset
ITS2 nucleotide sequences from 7 Culex mosquitoes characteristic of 5 geographical locations ( Italy , China , Africa ,
America , and Japan ) were downloaded from GenBank ( www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / genbank
) . The GenBank accession numbers for ITS2 sequences
from C:__entity__ .:__entity__ pipens:__entity__ ( North America ) , C:__entity__ .:__entity__ tritaeniorhynchus:__entity__ ( China ) , C:__entity__ .:__entity__ quinquefasciatus:__entity__
( Africa ) , C:__entity__ .:__entity__ tarsalis:__entity__ ( Italy ) , C:__entity__ .:__entity__ annulus:__entity__ ( China ) , C:__entity__ .:__entity__ pseudovishnui:__entity__
( China ) , and C:__entity__ .:__entity__ vishnui:__entity__ ( Japan ) were X75817 , AF305558 , Z48468 , U33031 , AF453488 , AF453498 and AF165900 ,
respectively .
Sequence alignments
Multiple sequence alignments were performed using CLUSTALW with a gap opening penalty of 15 and gap extension penalty of 6 . 66 .
[ 8 ]
Secondary structure prediction
The RNA secondary structures for ITS2 were predicted using RNADRAW .
[ 21 ]
RNADRAW predicts RNA structures by identifying suboptimal structures using the free energy optimization methodology at a default
temperature of 370 degrees C .
In the current study , ITS2 and 5 . 8S regions ( the first 170 nucleotides ) were used for RNA structure
prediction .
The minimum energy structure prediction algorithm in RNADRAW was ported from the RNAFOLD program included in the
Vienna RNA package .
[ 24 ] The dynamic programming algorithm employed in
RNADRAW was based on the work of Zuker and Stiegler [ 25 ] and uses energy
parameters taken from Turner [ 26 ] , Freier [ 27 ] and Jaeger .
[ 28 ]
Phylogenetic analysis
The phylogenetic Genebee service was used for phylogenetic tree construction .
[ 22
]
RNA fold
The Sribo program in Sfold ( Statistical Folding and Rational Design of Nucleic Acids ) was
used to predict the probable target accessibility sites ( loops ) for trans - cleaving ribozymes in ITS2 .
[ 24 ] The prediction of accessibility is based on a statistical sample of the Boltzmann
ensemble for secondary structures .
Here , we assessed the likelihood of unpaired sites for potential ribozyme target .
Each mRNA
exists as a population of different structures .
Hence , stochastic approach to the evaluation of accessible sites was found
appropriate .
[ 29 ] The probability profiling approach by Ding and Lawrence
[ 30 ] reveals target sites that are commonly accessible for
a large number of statistically representative structures in the target RNA .
This novel approach bypasses the long - standing
difficulty in accessibility evaluation due to limited representation of probable structures due to high statistical confidence
in predictions .
The probability profile for individual bases ( W = 1 ) is produced for the region that
includes a triplet and two flanking sequences of 15 bases each in every site of the selected cleavage triplet ( e . g . , GUC ) .
Results and Discussion
ITS2 sequences showed a taxonomic trend similar to that in phylogeny construction ( Figure 1A
) .
A multiple sequence alignment
of 5 . 8S rDNA and ITS2 showed in Figure 1B indicated that more distantly related species have
lower sequence similarity in the
ITS2 region .
The predicted features of ITS2 using RNADRAW are given in Table 1 .
The stems
( double stranded paired regions )
stabilize RNA secondary structures and the number of stems present in each ITS2 is given ( Table 1 ) .
ITS2 RNA structures from
C:__entity__ .:__entity__ pipiens:__entity__ and C:__entity__ .:__entity__ quinquefasciatus:__entity__ have the highest negative free energy ( - 149 . 38 Kcal and
- 148 . 23 Kcal ) followed by C:__entity__ .:__entity__ tarsalis:__entity__ ( - 129 . 2 ) , C:__entity__ .:__entity__ annulus:__entity__ and then by C:__entity__ .:__entity__ vishnui:__entity__
( - 115 . 3 ) , C:__entity__ .:__entity__ pseudovishnui:__entity__ ( - 105 . 66 ) and C:__entity__ .:__entity__ tritaeniorhyncus:__entity__ ( - 82 . 57 ) .
Visual comparison shows
that this is related to the trend in the cladogram given in Figure 1A .
A high degree of sequence similarity is observed at the
5 ' end compared to the 3 ' end ( Figure 1A ) .
This is due to factors such as genetic drift , the relative number and size of repeats ,
rates of unequal crossover , gene conversion , immigration and the number of the loci influencing the length .
[ 10 ] Furthermore , a high level of sequence similarity is found between C .
annulus and C:__entity__ .:__entity__ vishnui:__entity__ as well as C:__entity__ .:__entity__ quinquefasciatus:__entity__ and C:__entity__ .:__entity__
pipiens:__entity__ .
The simple tandem repeats shown in Figure 1B as bolded regions are found to be similar .
This similarity is seen in corresponding
RNA structures and computed energies .
The Culex species considered in this study were then grouped into three classes based on the similarity of
RNA stems and loops .
Despite their different geographic locations with varying eco - climatic conditions , class I
( C:__entity__ .:__entity__ annulus:__entity__ , C:__entity__ .:__entity__ pseudovishnui:__entity__ and C:__entity__ .:__entity__ vishnui:__entity__ ) isolates ( China and Japan ) showed high similarity
in secondary structural features .
Similar observations were seen in class II ( C:__entity__ .:__entity__ pipiens:__entity__ , C:__entity__ .:__entity__ quinquefasciatus:__entity__ and
C:__entity__ .:__entity__ tarsalis:__entity__ ) isolates from North America and Africa .
[ 19 ]
A high degree of similarity in the 5 . 8S region unlike the ITS2 is shown for different isolates due to relative evolutionary
selection .
[ 9 ] The loops 11 and 12 having sequences UGUCG and CUUCGGUG ,
respectively are highly conserved in all classes .
Figure 1C shows the distribution of different types of loops ( hairpin , bulge , multi branched , interior and exterior ) among
different isolates .
The segments of the ITS2 having score >= 50 are further probed carefully for target site to assess the
likelihood of unpaired segments .
Interestingly , the observed phylogenetic trend was identified with respect to the target
accessibility sites for the seven Culex isolates .
The order of preference is interior loop , bulge loop , multiple
branched loop , hairpin loop and exterior loops in all the isolates .
Several homologous domains were observed in the ITS regions of Aedes mosquito species by Wesson
et al [ 11 ] and was shown that these domains base pair to
form a core region central to
several stem features .
This suggested that conserved core region of rDNA is more important for a functional rRNA folding
pattern .
Barker found that ITS2 is unique in the 16 populations of Boophilus:__entity__ microplus:__entity__ , Boophilus:__entity__ decoloratus:__entity__ ,
Rhipicephalus:__entity__ appendiculatus:__entity__ , Rhipicephalus:__entity__ zambesiensis:__entity__ , Rhipicephalus:__entity__ evertsi:__entity__ , Rhipicephalus:__entity__ sanguineus:__entity__ , Rhipicephalus
turanicus , Rhipicephalus:__entity__ pumilio:__entity__ and Rhipicephalus:__entity__ camicasi:__entity__ from different geographical locations .
[ 12 ] These results suggest that the differences and similarity observed
in the ITS2 of different species are not simply accumulated due to random mutation and have evolved for functional selection
in ribosome biogenesis .
However , it was shown in three related mosquito genera ( Aedes , Psorophora and Haemogogus:__entity__ )
that the intra - spacer variable regions appear to co - evolve and that ITS2 variation is constrained by its secondary structure .
[ 11 ] Further studies have demonstrated that the ITS2 is essential
for the correct and efficient processing and maturation of 26S rRNA ribosomal units .
[
13 ] Furthermore , the information required for the efficient removal of ITS2 from its RNA precursor is not
localized but dispersed throughout the ITS2 region .
Thus , insertions and deletions ( indels ) that affect secondary structures
alter rRNA processing .
Critical changes in the rRNA folding pattern due to evolutionary sequence variation in the ITS spacer
regions may thus have an important role on the kinetics of precursor rRNA formation for the efficient functioning of rDNA clusters .
Conclusion
Comparison of ITS2 sequences from different isolates of Culex show similarity and variations .
Surprisingly , species displaying
sequence similarity belong to different geographical locations with diverse climatic and ecological conditions .
This implies that
the ITS2 regions have less selective pressure than the ribosomal regions .
Several common structural folds were shared among the
selected mosquitoes for maintaining functional equivalents .
Construction of an evolutionary tree using more isolates of
Culex will provide an understanding for their functional selection .
Integration in primary community care networks ( PCCNs ) : examination of governance , clinical , marketing , financial , and information infrastructures in a national demonstration project in Taiwan
Abstract
Background
Taiwan ' s primary community care network ( PCCN ) demonstration project , funded by the Bureau of National Health Insurance on March 2003 , was established to discourage hospital shopping behavior of people:__entity__ and drive the traditional fragmented health care providers into cooperate care models .
Between 2003 and 2005 , 268 PCCNs were established .
This study profiled the individual members in the PCCNs to study the nature and extent to which their network infrastructures have been integrated among the members ( clinics and hospitals ) within individual PCCNs .
Methods
The thorough questionnaire items , covering the network working infrastructures - governance , clinical , marketing , financial , and information integration in PCCNs , were developed with validity and reliability confirmed .
One thousand five hundred and fifty - seven clinics that had belonged to PCCNs for more than one year , based on the 2003 - 2005 Taiwan Primary Community Care Network List , were surveyed by mail .
Nine hundred and twenty - eight clinic members responded to the surveys giving a 59 . 6 % response rate .
Results
Overall , the PCCNs ' members had higher involvement in the governance infrastructure , which was usually viewed as the most important for establishment of core values in PCCNs ' organization design and management at the early integration stage .
In addition , it found that there existed a higher extent of integration of clinical , marketing , and information infrastructures among the hospital - clinic member relationship than those among clinic members within individual PCCNs .
The financial infrastructure was shown the least integrated relative to other functional infrastructures at the early stage of PCCN formation .
Conclusion
There was still room for better integrated partnerships , as evidenced by the great variety of relationships and differences in extent of integration in this study .
In addition to provide how the network members have done for their initial work at the early stage of network forming in this study , the detailed surveyed items , the concepts proposed by the managerial and theoretical professionals , could be a guide for those health care providers who have willingness to turn their business into multi - organizations .
Background
Taiwan ' s National Health Insurance ( NHI ) under the control of the Bureau of National Health Insurance ( BNHI ) , was launched in March 1995 to replace its social insurance system that was covering 59 % of its population : government employees , labourers , farmers and servicemen [ 1 ] .
By June 2003 the number of people:__entity__ insured had reached 21 , 956 , 729 ( 99 % ) .
There were 17 , 259 medical providers ( 92 % ) , including 575 hospitals and 16 , 684 clinics contracted with the BNHI for serving the enrolled population .
The unique phenomenon characterized in Taiwan health care industry different from those in the western countries is the freedom of patients:__entity__ to choose the health care providers they want , no matter what their disease severity is .
Furthermore , Taiwan people:__entity__ favor the larger scales of facilities and this fallacy leads to the phenomenon of big - hospital shopping .
For example , people:__entity__ choose the medical centers which are accredited as the highest level of medical science in Taiwan when they only suffer from a common cold .
In the spring of 2003 , the SARS epidemic viciously attacked the health of Taiwan ' s people:__entity__ .
The people:__entity__ ' s freedom to choose medical providers caused the national health authority to barely control and traced the flow of epidemic .
This event made Taiwan national health authorities rethink what happened and how it damaged under the traditional fragmented health care providers in Taiwan .
One health reform launched was named the " Primary Community Care Network ( PCCN ) demonstration project " , a nationwide health care financing program funded by the Bureau of National Health Insurance ( BNHI ) in March 2003 and it was a new model for the Taiwan government to redefine the role of family physicians in the health care delivery system .
A PCCN in Taiwan consists of a group of clinic physicians whose medical jobs are viewed as family care and at least one hospital for secondary or tertiary care .
The idea of member component design in PCCNs was aimed to lead the Taiwan citizens to choose one clinic physician as their personal family physician for health maintenance and this family physician also would have the responsibility of referring the patients:__entity__ to specialty care if necessary .
From a national health authority perspective , they expected the Taiwan people:__entity__ to put an end to their fallacy that " bigger is better " for health care organizations and establish the idea of " human:__entity__ health " , starting with prevention and primary care , followed by secondary or tertiary care , emphasizing health promotion and maintenance instead of disease curing .
Furthermore , it could decrease the inappropriateness of medical usage , i . e . , over - uses of secondary and tertiary medical services in the high - tech hospitals .
In addition , the national health authority was expected to drive the traditional fragmented heath care providers into coordinated medical multidisciplinary teams and share the limited medical resources through the PCCN demonstration project .
In summary , the PCCN demonstration project was aimed to : 1 ) change the traditional patients:__entity__ ' customs of freely choosing health care organizations and establish referral channels along the continuum of care , and 2 ) establish partnerships among the primary care clinics and hospitals to provide a continuum of health care services .
It was also expected to establish the primary care system of family physicians to provide whole - people:__entity__ health care and improve care quality [ 1 ] .
Partnership structures in the PCCNs represent the virtual vertical ( i . e . , between the member clinics and hospitals ) and virtual horizontal ( i . e . , among the member clinics ) aspects of organizing , which designate the formal relationships between individuals and the total network and include organizational design to ensure effective communication , coordination , and integration across the total network .
Each PCCN consists of five to ten clinics : half of them should offer the services of general medicine , internal medicine , surgery , obstetrics and gynecology , pediatric , or family medicine .
And each PCCN has a central headquarters , usually in one of the clinic facilities , to coordinate and integrate the network .
All the clinic physicians in a PCCN are assigned the roles of " family physicians " or " gatekeepers " who recruit people:__entity__ from the local community , keep background and medical files on them , certify family physician education training programs , and hold office hours in the member hospital , where they serve as joint faculty members for further medical consultations or medical utilizations of labs and tests , if necessary .
In addition , the hospital member is asked to help clinic physicians in their network to set up a medical information system , share hospital resources ( medical equipment and library literature ) with the clinic physicians in their network and establish referral channels among the network members .
Furthermore , this new demonstration model tries to minimize the barriers to patient:__entity__ access by setting up 24 - hour a day , 7 - day a week medical consultation telephone lines for providing urgent services onsite and for taking care of the patients:__entity__ whose family physicians ' practices are closed to assure seamless care channels .
The BNHI funded these extra demonstration actions , at around one hundred thousand US dollars ( i . e . , NT $ 3 , 500 , 000 ) for each PCCN under the current fee - for - service payment system [ 1 ] .
Figure 1 describes the organizational structure of individual PCCNs introduced in the demonstration project in Taiwan .
To date , the PCCN demonstration project has been in operation for more than three years .
There have been 268 PCCNs formed in the period of 2003 to 2005 around Taiwan .
The geographical distributions of PCCNs and their members were described in Table 1 .
Analyzing all 1 , 557 participating clinic members in the demonstration project in terms of medical specialties , they cover general medicine , internal medicine , surgeries , obstetrics and gynecology , pediatrics , family medicines , otolaryngology , ophthalmology , rehabilitation medicine , dermatology , and psychiatry , with 237 clinics providing more than two specialties .
On the other hand , each PCCN recruits at least one district or regional accredited hospital for acute care demands ( required for network members ) and a medical center for tertiary care support ( not required for network members ) .
There are 6 medical centers , 52 regional hospitals , and 71 district hospitals joining in the demonstration project .
See Table 1 for more detailed information about the PCCN members .
To date , there have been few empirical studies of the working relationships that have developed between members of the PCCN program .
Partnership needs a method to determine at an early stage , to make sure whether they are making the most of collaboration [ 2 ] and the acceptance of the contracting networks in Taiwan as an organizational innovation worthy of greater diffusion deserves to be explored .
Therefore , this study used a structured questionnaire to characterize the relationship among the members in the individual PCCNs , with regard to governance , clinical , marketing , financing , as well as information integration infrastructures .
The results of this study provide descriptive analyses in detail to map the partnership developments , to enrich the body of knowledge of the partner relationships and to help policy makers understand the coordinated efforts of these health care providers which have developed under this system .
It also provides the recommendations for heath policy decision - making and management of networks of health care providers for the future involvement .
Methods
This study was aimed at providing descriptive analyses to map the partnership development .
To understand the actual integration actions done by network members , the theoretical concept employed by network partnerships were described and then the derived survey instrument was developed .
Theoretical framework for organization design of network integration
The rapid organizational changes in the health care industry have driven theorists from every discipline and across the world to seek an approach that allows organizations to flourish .
Organization theory allows investigators to profile an organization from the aspect of patterns and regularities in organizational design and behavior .
In the early 20th century , classical management theorists claimed that an organization has " a best way " to be organized and managed [ 3 ] .
That implied that all organizations would own the " same " organizational styles or structures .
In the 1960s , several theorists [ 4 - 8 ] challenged this assumption by applying a " contingency approach " to propose that there is no best way to organize an organization , and that the effectiveness of an organizational structure varies with the situation of an organization .
Furthermore , it is proposed that the best way to organize an organization depends on the nature of the environment to which the organization relates .
Contingency theory delineates the concepts " organization ' s internal features , " " the demands of organizational environments , " " best adaptation , " and , the most important and difficult of all , " best match " [ 9 ] .
Lawrence & Lorsch [ 7 ] argued that environments characterized by uncertainty and rapid rates of change in market conditions or technology impose different demands , including constraints and opportunities , on organizations than do placid and stable environments .
Similarly to Lawrence and Lorsch ' s views mentioned above , Galbraith [ 10 , 11 ] stressed the contingency perspective on information processing .
The information - processing approach emphasizes that environment , size , and technology impose different information - processing requirements on organizations , and thus an organization must be designed to encourage information flow in both vertical and horizontal directions to achieve the overall tasks of the organization and , finally , organizational effectiveness [ 11 - 14 ] .
Some theorists have criticized conventional contingency theorists who presume that organizational structure is driven by the environment .
Child [ 15 ] , Miller [ 16 ] , Van de Ven and Drazin [ 17 ] , and Tushman and Romanelli [ 18 ] raised such criticisms ; they argued that organizations become what they are not only because of the environment , but also because of choices made by members , especially choices about strategy and organizational design .
As Thompson ' s words in the book Organizations in Action [ 8 ] put it , " organizations are not determined simply by their environments ( p . 27 ) . " He also pointed out that " administration may innovate on any or all of the necessary dimensions , but only to the extent that innovations are acceptable to those on whom the organization can and must depend . " Instead of assuming that administrators are highly constrained in their decisions , strategic contingency theorists emphasized " the importance of choice , " that is , " the freedom of agency " [ 15 ] .
Furthermore , Pfeffer [ 19 ] explicitly pointed out that " organizational structures are the outcomes of political contests within organizations ( p . 38 ) . "
Daft [ 14 ] proposed a top management model to delineate how " a strategy is a plan for interacting with the competitive environment to achieve organizational goals . " He stated that the major responsibility of top management is to determine the goals , strategy , and design of an organization to adapt to a changing environment .
To assess the external and internal environments of an organization seems to be the first task for top managers in defining an organization ' s goals and missions .
Then , guided by the goals and missions of the organization , top managers shape the design of the organization , including structural forms , information system , technology , human:__entity__ resources , organizational culture , and inter - organizational linkages , to achieve the final organizational performance .
Integration refers to the mechanisms of coordination , the ways guided to partnership goals to fit internal and external conditions [ 7 , 20 , 21 ] .
In the early 1990s , proposals for US national health care reform recognized the need for integrating mechanisms to achieve both financial success and quality of care of a well - organized system of care [ 22 , 23 ] .
Several researchers also viewed inter - organizational cooperation as resource exchanges , including client referrals , money , and staff [ 24 - 27 ] .
From practical ways of viewing integration , the success of integration lies in the coordinative mechanisms and partnership working that support it [ 28 ] , including an administrative organization that coordinates the operations of various health care services ; a management information system that integrates clinical , utilization , and financial data and follows clients across different settings ; a care coordination program such as case management or disease management that works with clients to arrange health care services ; and a financial mechanism that enables pooling of funds across services [ 29 - 35 ] .
Fox [ 36 ] suggested the success of integrated health networks should ensure that the new business link such aspects as technology , functional skills , customer access , management , or products that can be shared across both the core and the new business ; to conduct market financial evaluation ; to share the risk of vertical integration with outside entities , to develop the management structure that can reflect the degree of coordination necessary to support the core business activities ; to ensure that the integration strategy meets the needs of customers , including medical treatment , the use of medical technology , and the preferred methods of purchase ; and to measure the new business by its value to the enterprise as a whole , rather than by its profitability as a stand - alone entity .
In summary , the effects that integration in inter - organizational designs has on network management were substantial from a managerial perspective .
Borrowing the ideas of strategic contingency perspective [ 8 , 15 , 19 ] and top management model [ 14 ] , it could be imply that success ( organization performance ) in reengineering a network lies in the integration of process and services ( see Figure 1 ) , including leadership / governing structure , teamwork between disciplines and patient:__entity__ care , financial planning , and information systems , characterized as the constructs of governance , clinical , financial , and information infrastructures , respectively , in this study .
In addition , another construct , marketing infrastructure , was especially important and designed to explore for PCCNs in this study because of patients:__entity__ ' freedom of making healthcare choice and the traditional fragmented health care systems by individual health care organizations in Taiwan .
One major reason for Taiwan people:__entity__ ' s hospital shopping preferences was that Taiwan people:__entity__ usually believe the bigger the facility , the better capacities a facility has no matter on any aspect from medical professionals to tangible medical equipment and plants .
And this fallacy made the public want to overuse the facility with high - tech medical services no matter if it fits their needs .
From the health policy and management perspectives , therefore , the health care providers were encouraged to market their services as a new corporate identity and brand strategy [ 37 ] , including offering tangible resources such as books , libraries , medical equipment , and intangible resources such as knowledge and information exchanges ( education ) and reputation sharing one another among PCCN members .
Furthermore , through the process of marketing resource exchanges , therefore , each PCCN could establish the images of " one system , one brand and quality " for the public and for the health care providers .
It also makes it be more visible to the public .
The five integration infrastructures of network management were constructed as a conceptual framework in this study to help to portray how the PCCN members have done .
The survey instrument development was described in the following .
Survey instrument development : integration infrastructures and measurements of partnerships
Based on the five integration infrastructures of network management , the structured questionnaire were derived from extensive literature reviews .
Governance infrastructure
Governance assumes the broad responsibility for organizational goals and survival and involves the series process of setting and monitoring organizational goals and strategy development through a board of representatives [ 38 ] .
Governance or administrative integration infrastructure in establishing network partnerships refers to administrative structures ( or responsibilities ) created to facilitate communication , clear lines of authority , accountability , and responsibility for patient:__entity__ care services ; to negotiate budgets and financial trade - offs ; and to present a cohesive , consistent message in interactions with external agencies and the community [ 29 , 39 - 41 ] and most important for members in contract agreements , to manage participation [ 33 ] .
From a multidisciplinary perspective , Mitchell and Shortell [ 42 ] applied the concepts of governance and management characteristics in effective community health partnerships .
The construct of governance involved several tasks , including setting priorities for strategic goals , choosing the membership composition , obtaining the necessary financial resources , and setting up the accountability systems , and so on .
The construct of the management refers to the tasks of engaging and maintaining organizational members ' interest in a shared vision and mission , providing appropriate structures and coordination mechanisms for the specified strategies , promoting constructive conflicts and managing destructive conflicts , implementing information systems to monitor the dynamics , adjusting the leadership in the overall membership , and so on .
The issues of governance and administrative integration in the PCCNs could include [ 2 , 38 , 40 , 41 , 43 - 47 ] :
* planning the shared visions and missions
* determining the shared service strategies , cooperation priorities , policies and principles
* identifying the information needed and how to get it
* organizing the network dynamics and member roles
* leading and managing the conflicts and communication
* designing and controlling the shared network performance systems , including indicator settings , feedbacks , and accountability .
Clinical infrastructure
The idea of care integration begins through such public programs that include social workers in public welfare departments , caseworkers in mental health , or nurses in public health departments .
In the late 1980s , care integration was deemed necessary for the streamlining of care and negotiating the maze of long - term care services .
At that time , it was referred to as service coordination or case management , or in other related terms [ 29 ] .
The purpose of care integration is to work directly with patients:__entity__ and their families over time to help them arrange and manage the complex resources that patients:__entity__ may need to maintain health and independent functioning .
At the same time , care integration is used to achieve the most cost - effective use possible of scarce resources , by steering patients:__entity__ to the health , social , and support services most appropriate for them at a given time [ 29 ] .
Conrad and Dowling [ 33 ] pointed out that to coordinate and integrate patient:__entity__ care relies on connecting patient:__entity__ services at the different stages of the patient:__entity__ care processes .
Care coordination in integrated networks can be achieved through integration of training programs and some clinical services , provision of complementary clinical capabilities , clinical geographic proximity design , clear role definition of each institution , commitment and flexibility of leaderships and medical staffs , and the support of a large referring physician groups embracing the affiliation concepts [ 48 ] .
The issues of clinical integration in the PCCNs could include [ 48 - 50 ] :
* planning and differentiating target markets based on the clinical services of the network members
* uniting individual clinical professionals for clinical project planning
* designing patient:__entity__ - centered care or case management teams
* establishing committees responsible for patient:__entity__ - centered case report meetings , case referral , transfer , and tracing , file management ( record and information exchanges ) , clinical quality management ( quality assurance , improvement , risk and malpractice management , and utilization review ) , and medical continuing education and on - job education .
Marketing infrastructure
Marketing integration refers to how to work together as a whole both from the provider and patient:__entity__ perspectives .
One of the case reports interviewing developing integrated delivery system or networks realized that the most important thing is how an integrated system or network is promoted and what is promoted for the consumers [ 51 ] , including focusing on product development , making sure the branding holds together , marketing directly to consumers , demonstrating values to consumers , and even conducting marketing research to make efforts for the long term .
In a health care network with several organizational members and target patients:__entity__ , the marketing infrastructure in PCCNs here refers to provider members ' marketing , meaning the resource sharing and market development in a PCCN as a whole .
The issues of the marketing integration in the PCCNs could include [ 37 , 52 - 54 ] :
* sharing the literature and facility publications among the network members
* uniting public promotions such as united activities , electronic and paper media for enhancing the network reputation as " one system , one brand and quality "
* differentiating target markets of the network for competing in the medical industry .
Financial infrastructure
Comprehensive , flexible , and adequate financing is a goal of the ideal continuum of care .
That component is the most critical and challenging to manage under the changes in the health care delivery environment .
Gillies et al .
[ 30 ] suggested that integrating financial management across operating units adds the greatest value to systems or organizations .
In one case study , Bramson et al .
[ 55 ] also showed that reducing costs through joint purchasing by the radiology departments of a vertically integrated health system could yield substantial savings .
The issues of the financial integration in the PCCNs could include :
* budgeting
* uniting equipment , medical materials , and drug purchasing and routine administrative stuff management
* pooling recruitment funds
* designing a financial risk and sharing mechanism .
Information infrastructure
Information is an essential component of an organization .
A complete information system can help an organization to integrate its individual units and efficiently manage the continuum .
The ideal information system for a continuum of care was conceived of and formed in the mid - 1980s [ 56 ] .
During the late 1980s , computer technology began to make an information system feasible and affordable through new computer chips with expanded capability and networking technology .
In the 1990s , the individual services of the continuum upgraded their information systems to combine clinical , financial , and utilization data [ 29 ] .
Some studies have argued that the quality of information systems can drive costs down , because a good information system can give physicians easy electronic access to complete the documentation of the patients:__entity__ ' clinical records , better inform them about reimbursement and capitation issues , help them easily associate and manage cases together , and achieve a higher level of professional satisfaction [ 57 , 58 ] .
Using Inova Health System , an integrated delivery system in northern Virginia , as an example , Wager , Heda , and Austin [ 59 ] showed that by developing a health information network within an integrated delivery system , Inova can have a clinical transaction system for hospitals and other entities , a data repository for decision support and outcome management , a managed care information system to support managed care and capitation contracts , and greater capability to acquire physicians .
The issues of information coordination include [ 60 - 68 ] :
* establishing an electronic medical record system , regional information network for patient:__entity__ clinical and administrative data , clinical service arrangements and administrative work
* uniting the system information management and web pages .
The structured questionnaire was developed with the wording of practical managerial actions based on the five concepts just mentioned .
There were 19 survey items on governance infrastructure , 25 on clinical infrastructure , 13 on marketing infrastructure , 20 on financial infrastructure , and 7 on information infrastructure .
All 84 items were , simultaneously , applied to examine the relationships of the clinic ' s peer members and the relationship of clinic and hospital members in a PCCN , and it resulted in a total of 168 survey questions .
The detailed information of the item questions was listed in Table 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 .
The structured questionnaires were drafted from previous literatures and then examined by two academic professors for theoretical accuracy .
Then one pilot study was pre - tested for the PCCN pioneers ( i . e . , 92 network clinic members ) and 116 hospital providers which have partner relationships with other health care organizations ( i . e . , hospitals , clinics , long - term care facilities ) .
The wordings and meanings of each question item were revised to assure content validity .
The Cronbach alpha values for the five integration constructs - governance , clinical , marketing , finance , and information infrastructure were 0 . 946 , 0 . 958 , 0 . 932 , 0 . 944 , and 0 . 898 for the measures of clinic - clinic member relationships ; and 0 . 945 , 0 . 949 , 0 . 916 , 0 . 948 , and 0 . 896 for the measures of clinic - hospital member relationships .
Study subjects
To find the member partnership , we sent questionnaires to 1 , 557 individual clinics which had belonged to PCCNs for at least one year , based on information contained in the Taiwan Primary Community Care Network List ( Bureau of National Health Insurance 2003 , 2004 and 2005 ) .
We let clinic members in all PCCNs point out how they coordinate with their peer clinic members and hospital members within a PCCN because individual clinic members could be better informants than hospital members , which need to deal with multiple clinic relationships and therefore might find it hard to describe the coordination involvement one by one with clinic members .
Moreover , networks form for various reasons and it might lead to the various involvements by individual network members ( i . e . , hospital and clinic members ) .
Therefore , using the participating clinics as individual survey units , the results could portray the overall dynamics and processes more authentically and detailed throughout all PCCNs in the demonstration project .
Nine hundred and twenty - eight clinics responded ( 59 . 6 % ) , with 239 clinics in the Taipei region , 165 in the northern region , 241 in the central region , 108 in the southern region , 150 in the Kao - Ping region , and 15 in the eastern region of Taiwan .
Ten clinics had not mentioned their practicing locations .
There is no statistically significant difference in geographical distribution between the respondents and the study population ( chi 2 = 4 . 208 , p > 0 . 05 ) .
Analytical techniques
The data was first analyzed descriptively with frequency counts ( percentage ) for each survey item , instead of using mean as a statistical method , because the variation among the respondents may not represent the normal distribution and it might ignore the extreme values for the respondents ' answers .
To compare how the respondents perceived the strength of integration existing in clinic - clinic and clinic - hospital relationships , paired t - tests were performed for individual survey items , using the original numerical scores .
Results
Profiling the partnerships in Taiwan PCCNs : governance infrastructure
With regard to the governance infrastructures , the frequency was counted for each survey item with recalculated scales : disagree ( Likert scale 1 and 2 ) , fair ( Likert scale 3 ) , and agree ( Likert scale 4 and 5 ) with individual items .
In clinic - clinic relationship ( Table 2 ) , the majority of clinic members agree that the determined deals were obeyed ( Table 2 , item 1 : 88 . 69 % ) , the goals and strategies of members were well - understood ( Table 2 , item 16 : 79 . 74 % ) , and the united principals for individual members were developed ( Table 2 , item 15 : 79 . 42 % ) .
The higher percentages were also found in clinic - hospital relationship in the same items ( Table 2 ) .
On the other hand , establishing fair coordination mechanism ( Table 2 , item 11 : 27 . 91 % ) , designing and employing the network performance indicators ( Table 2 , item 3 : 21 . 23 % ) , and establishing communication models and channels ( Table 2 , item 12 : 19 . 94 % ) still occupied higher percentages not developed and deserved to been made the focus of more efforts in the future .
Paired t - test analyses for all individual survey items of governance infrastructure showed that the deals obeyed ( Table 2 , item1 ) and plans and goals controlled ( Table 2 , item 2 ) were achieved more in clinic - clinic relationships than those in clinic - hospital relationships ; however , the design of network performance indicators ( Table 2 , item 3 ) , development of disintegration policy and principals ( Table 2 , item 8 ) , and the establishment of fair coordination mechanism ( Table 2 , item 11 ) were reached more in clinic - hospital relationships than those in clinic - clinic relationships .
Profiling the partnerships in Taiwan PCCNs : clinical infrastructure
Examining the extent of clinical infrastructure for network members , establishing two - directed patient:__entity__ referral systems and patient:__entity__ referral information files ( Table 3 , items 35 & 37 ) and uniting medical continuing education and on - job education ( Table 3 , item 34 ) were shown at a highly implemented rate in clinic - clinic ( more than 70 % ) and clinic - hospital ( more than 80 % ) relationships .
On the other hand , network members had higher percentages ( more than 40 % ) not to think about the possible integration mechanisms including establishing committees to deal with medical malpractice ( Table 3 , item 44 ) , planning and differentiating clinical market areas ( Table 3 , item 20 ) , and designing patient:__entity__ - centered case management teams ( Table 3 , item 22 ) .
Overall , there was better clinical integration involvement for all the described items in clinic - hospital relationships than those in clinic - clinic relationships within a network in this study ( see Table 3 , paired t - tests , p < 0 . 05 ) .
Profiling the partnerships in Taiwan PCCNs : marketing infrastructure
For marketing planning , the clinics had better integrated marketing activities with their respective hospitals than with peer clinic members within PCCNs for all studied items ( Table 4 , paired t - test , p < 0 . 05 ) .
Examining the clinic - clinic relationships , uniting social activities ( Table 4 , item 53 ) , sharing the individual facility reports for updated services ( Table 4 , item 46 ) , public promotion ( Table 4 , item 54 ) , and uniting and joining the facility activities ( Table 4 , item 51 ) were the top four marketing works done among clinic members ( more than 60 % implemented rate ) ; and those items also showed a higher implemented rate ( more than 70 % ) between clinic and hospital members .
On the other hand , facility assets such as reports ( Table 4 , item 49 ) , and professional literatures and books ( Table 4 , item 45 ) were not well - shared among clinic members ( " never - thinking " rate : 42 . 13 % ) .
In addition , uniting the network publication could make more efforts in the future ( " never - thinking " rate in item 50 : 39 . 98 % ) .
The room for clinic - hospital partnership to think about acting was kind of different from those in the clinic - clinic relationship .
In addition to the uniting publication that can be encouraged to improve the clinic - hospital relationship ( Table 4 , item 50 : 27 . 48 % ) , cooperating in research projects ( Table 4 , item 52 : 25 . 00 % ) and identifying and differentiating target markets ( Table 4 , item 57 : 24 . 57 % ) had still more opportunities to be focused on in the future .
Profiling the partnerships in Taiwan PCCNs : financial infrastructure
The PCCN members were found to have a lower extent of financial integration as evidenced by higher percentage of ' ' never thinking ' ' scale about the survey items on almost all items ( see Table 5 ) .
Slightly more integration ( that is , ' ' acting ' ' rate ) was found in only four items both in clinic - clinic relationships and in clinic - hospital relationships , including uniting budget planning ( Table 5 : item 58 ) , sharing places , materials , and equipment ( Table 5 : item 68 ) , uniting budgeting for certain services ( Table 5 : items 72 ) , and designing the resource distribution principals based on the whole network goals ( Table 5 : item 77 ) .
Further examining the financial infrastructure in clinic - clinic relationship and clinic - hospital relationship , paired - t tests revealed that clinic - hospital partnerships were involved more in places , materials , and equipment sharing and maintenance ( Table 5 , items 62 and 68 ) ( p < 0 . 05 ) and higher financial infrastructure coordination exists in clinic - clinic relationships ( Table 5 , items 58 , 59 , 63 - 65 , 72 , 74 , 75 , and 77 ) ( p < 0 . 05 ) .
Profiling the partnerships in Taiwan PCCNs : information infrastructure
There was significantly greater integration of information in clinic - hospital than clinic - clinic relationships in all items in this category ( Table 6 , paired t - tests , p < 0 . 001 ) .
The greatest integration was found in electronic patient:__entity__ records ( Table 6 : item 78 ) , followed by information integration for patient:__entity__ data ( Table 6 : item 79 ) and clinical service arrangements ( Table 6 : item 81 ) .
The lowest level of integration in information infrastructure was found in administrative works such as registration , billing and so on ( Table 6 : item 82 , ' ' never - thinking ' ' rate more than 50 % ) within network members .
Discussion
In this study , we surveyed 943 clinics that had belonged to Taiwan PCCNs for more than a year to understand the nature and extent of integration to which they and their associated PCCN members ( clinics and hospitals ) had in governance , clinical , marketing , financial , and information infrastructures .
It was found a wide variance in the kind and degree of integration among them and a lot of room for better integration ( Table 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ) .
From the governance perspective , we found lower integration was found in the establishment of fair coordination mechanism ( Table 2 : item 11 ) among member clinics and member hospitals .
Coordination could be viewed from different perspectives , including the use of standardized languages and forms , organizational rules and procedures , the establishment of common rules , policies , and procedures , and the monitoring through memos , reports , and a computerized information system [ 69 , 70 ] .
Facing the cumbersome integration processes , it suggests that each PCCN ' s headquarters should become actively involved and clarify the authority , responsibility and accountability of individual members , identify the potential conflict sources , and publicize the rules and regulation of network integration dynamics covering decision making processes , market planning , clinical teamwork designs , and financial reports of individual network members .
These actions could enhance the trust and respect of network members one another and could improve the small extent of integration found in this study about the mechanisms for communication models and channels in the PCCNs ( Table 2 : item 12 ) .
From the network management perspective , communication could occur between the various entities such as between hospital and clinics , primary care physicians and specialists , managers and clinical professionals , and even among the clinical professionals in the network .
To develop effective and timely communication channels was the key for the management of integrated organizations [ 30 - 32 ] and could alleviate the tensions that sometimes occur in the dynamics of the multi - organizations .
In this study , it was found a low level of involvement of medical teams in medical projects , patient:__entity__ - centered case management , and case report meetings among the network members ( Table 3 : item 21 , 22 , and 23 ) from a clinical integration perspective .
Several researchers have addressed that clinical integration providing a process of medical management , care management , case management , and patient:__entity__ management designed to transform the traditionally fragmented delivery system into a more cohesive system [ 71 ] , and lead to higher service quality and assure financial objectives [ 72 , 73 ] .
More attention could be paid to these activities in the future .
In addition , it was also found less integration in planning and differentiating clinical market areas ( Table 3 , item 20 ) among the network members in the category of clinical infrastructure .
This may result from the existing specialty diversities in individual PCCNs , which might not need to involve planning and differentiating market area based on the members ' clinical services at the early stage of network development .
There was more involvement in marketing efforts in clinic - hospital relationships than in clinic - clinic relationships .
Generally speaking , hospitals have more resources ( i . e . , money , human:__entity__ resources , materials , and physical assets ) than clinics , which might explain the stronger marketing involvements between the clinic and hospital members , including the library sharing ( books and literatures ) , facility brochure dissemination , public promoting , and medical research cooperation .
These integration efforts also meet the expectation of the national health authority for resource sharing and medical quality image enhancement among the health care providers .
Financial infrastructure was found to be the least integrated , with most items never considered .
Perhaps the only reason for the higher score of budget planning activities ( Table 5 : items 58 and 77 ) was that BHNI required each PCCN to design and determine its budgeting arrangement in advance before joining the demonstration project .
While slightly more financial involvement was made among network members ( Table 5 : items 68 , 72 & 73 ) , possibly due to similar needs , there remains a lot of room for financial integration in the future .
There was a need for networks to develop electronic information systems , though creating and managing an integrated information system involves very detailed work .
Most of the clinics surveyed have focused more on the individual public members ' administrative works such as filing patient:__entity__ medical records , collecting and managing network patient:__entity__ clinical data , and scheduling clinical services , which were required by the BNHI .
The factors for the health care managers to adopt the integrated clinical information systems include the decision of make or buy , adoption leadership , adoption objectives , implementation leadership , phased versus simultaneous implementation , parallel systems , information technology implementation policies and practices , use levels and resistance , and realized benefits and return on investment calculation [ 66 ] , which might be very cumbersome and time - consuming .
It suggests that the network partners might be engaged , firstly , more in simpler network cooperation such as the administrative systems for patient:__entity__ admission to the network members and establishing united web pages for patients:__entity__ to access their family physicians and network members for medical and public promotion purposes .
And for further integrated information investments , efforts must be redirected for network members to work together to define the approach to specific classes of integration for the long term [ 74 ] .
Conclusion
This study tried to portray and trace how the facility participants:__entity__ were involved in the Taiwan PCCNs .
It was found that Taiwan PCCNs ' members had higher involvement in the governance infrastructure , which was usually viewed as the most important for establishment of core values in PCCNs ' organization design and management .
There existed a higher extent of integration of clinical , marketing , and information infrastructures among the hospital - clinic member relationship than those among clinic members within individual PCCNs .
The financial infrastructure was shown the least integrated relative to other functional infrastructures at the early stage of PCCN formation .
Page [ 43 ] argued that networks form and grow for various reasons , however , only some of them could be compatible with the iterative processes of collaboration .
Some participants:__entity__ in the PCCNs may simply seek short - term economic gains and have little interest in joint learning and continuous improvement .
From an organizational design perspective , the old phrase proposed by the wisdom of the saying about developing the integrated organizations ( networks ) should be - " coming together is the beginning , and working together is the success . " Page [ 43 ] examined the virtual provider organizations such as physician - hospital organizations and pointed out the issue of the provider attitudes and behaviors as the critically successful continuous improvements in the health care environments .
A wide variance of degree of network integration in Taiwan PCCNs still leaves room to improve .
In this study , the thoroughly surveyed items , that is , the potential network design content , were employed .
In addition to provide how the network members have done their initial work at the early stage of network forming in this study , the detailed surveyed items , the concepts proposed by the managerial and theoretical professionals , could be also a guide for those health care providers who have a willingness to join multi - organizations .
It suggests that health care providers could take more detailed looks about those surveyed items and give some possible opportunities to create the potential actions .
Further research could be empirically done to explore the relative influence of these integration mechanisms on the effectiveness of organizational partnerships .
The partnerships within each PCCN represent various relationships that depend on how much the members are engaged in the projects .
In addition to the macro concepts including governance , clinical , marketing , financial , and information infrastructures explored in this study , other managerial issues for integrated organizations were also suggested such as formation of an integrated cultural atmosphere , human:__entity__ resources management , physician involvement , mission and commitment establishment , from micro organizational behavior perspective [ 30 - 32 , 34 , 36 , 75 , 76 ] .
Micro managerial and longitudinal research designs could be employed to more precisely catch the never completing integration efforts in the future .

Recombinant activated protein C in sepsis : endothelium protection or endothelium therapy ?
Abstract
Endothelium dysfunction is one of the hallmarks of sepsis .
Looney and Mattay , in the previous issue of Critical Care , highlight the role of activated protein C ( APC ) as a protective endothelial drug in septic situations .
Nevertheless , the results of in vivo studies are less explicit and it remains uncertain whether these properties are relevant in human:__entity__ septic shock .
Before considering recombinant APC ( rAPC ) as a therapeutic drug for the endothelium , we have to demonstrate its efficiency to protect or to reduce endothelium injury when infused a long time after the septic challenge .
Nevertheless , if rAPC is efficient when infused in the early phase of septic challenge , we thus need to treat our patients:__entity__ earlier .
At the least , genetically engineered variants have been designed with greater anti - apoptotic activity and reduced anticoagulant activity relative to wild - type APC .
Further studies are needed to demonstrate the usefulness of these variants in septic shock therapy .
The use of recombinant activated protein C ( rAPC ) is one of the hottest topics in septic shock therapy .
The pivotal phase 3 placebo - controlled Protein C Worldwide Evaluation in Severe Sepsis ( PROWESS ) clinical trial demonstrated a 19 . 4 % relative risk reduction in 28 - day mortality ( 6 . 1 % absolute risk reduction ) with an increased risk ( 3 . 5 % versus 2 . 0 % ) of serious bleeding events compared with placebo .
Two recent and important articles have highlighted the role of APC as a protective endothelial drug [ 1 ] and as a cyto - protective drug [ 2 ] .
Beneficial effects of rAPC in the PROWESS study were thought to be related to a reduction in coagulation and , to a lesser extent , to a reduction in inflammatory response to sepsis [ 3 ] .
Post - PROWESS investigations have been associated with a myriad of cellular or animal studies demonstrating that rAPC , through reactions mediated by endothelial protein C receptor and the effector receptor , protease activated receptor - 1 , acts directly on cells to exert multiple cytoprotective effects including : down regulation of pro - inflammatory gene expression [ 4 ] ; anti - inflammatory activities [ 5 ] ; anti - apoptotic activity [ 6 ] ; and protection of endothelial barrier function [ 1 , 2 ] .
Endothelium dysfunction is one of the hallmarks of sepsis [ 7 ] .
Sepsis , per se , may induce phenotypic modulations of the endothelium through direct or indirect interaction of the endothelial layer with components of the bacterial wall , inducing a myriad of host - derived factors from endothelial cells .
Phenotypic modifications include changes in pro - coagulant and proadhesive properties , increased endothelial permeability , endothelial cell apoptosis and changes in vasomotor properties ; the last of these is crucial since vasoplegia is directly related to septic shock mortality .
Recent animal and human:__entity__ data have suggested that rAPC may improve both vascular and myocardial dysfunction and vascular reactivity to catecholamine during endotoxin and / or septic challenge [ 8 , 9 ] .
From bench to bedside
Experimental evidence supports a role of APC in maintaining the integrity of the endothelium through both direct and indirect mechanisms .
Nevertheless , the results of in vivo studies are less explicit .
In a retrospective study of septic shock in humans:__entity__ , Monnet and colleagues [ 9 ] demonstrated that APC infusion was associated with a decrease in the amount of delivered norepinephrine .
Wiel and colleagues [ 10 ] demonstrated in a rabbit:__entity__ model of endotoxin induced shock that APC decreased aorta endothelial injury .
By contrast , in a lung model of endotoxin induced inflammation , Robriquet and colleagues [ 11 ] demonstrated a trend to an increased vascular permeability using high doses of human:__entity__ APC .
This last result was in sharp contrast with the results obtained by Nick and colleagues [ 12 ] in a human:__entity__ model of pulmonary endotoxin administration .
APC appears to improve mortality in septic shock with a high APACHE 2 score and is potentially detrimental in severe sepsis .
In rats , APC markedly decreased tumour necrosis factor concentrations whereas they remained unchanged in either human:__entity__ septic shock or endotoxemia .
The question arises , therefore , as to whether it is truly possible to reconcile all these discrepancies ?
Moreover , can these stirring laboratory data be translated into clinical practice ?
Limitations of experimental studies : endothelium protection versus endothelium therapy
Clearly , in cellular and animal models , rAPC has been given either as a pre - treatment or concurrent with septic challenge .
This mode of administration favours the anti - inflammatory effects of rAPC , which are particularly efficient in murine:__entity__ models in protecting the endothelium from cytokine - mediated apoptosis or upregulation of endothelial adhesion molecules .
Thus , studies using post - injury treatment are needed in models that mimic septic shock , such as experimental pneumonia or peritonitis treated by antibiotics and volume resuscitation , and where the effects of rAPC would be investigated 16 to 24 hours after septic challenge .
If we can demonstrate the efficiency of rAPC to protect or to reduce endothelium injury in these conditions , we can ultimately postulate that rAPC is also a therapeutic drug for the endothelium .
The earlier the better
If rAPC is efficient when infused in the early phase of septic challenge , we thus need to treat our patients:__entity__ earlier .
At least two studies suggest that treatment with rAPC within 24 hours may carry a larger survival advantage for patients:__entity__ with severe sepsis , compared with those treated more than 24 hours after organ dysfunction [ 13 ] .
Interventions directed at specific endpoints , when initiated early in the ' golden hours ' of a patient ' s condition , seem to be promising [ 14 ] .
The beneficial effects of earlier administration of rAPC to appropriate patients:__entity__ may fit into this paradigm .
The future
Extensive in vivo and in vitro studies have focused on the cytoprotective effects of APC and most authors agree that its anticoagulant and cytoprotective effects are mediated by distinct APC structural features .
Positively charged residues in surface loops in the APC protease domain have been identified as participating in the anticoagulant activity but not in cellular effects .
Hence , variants have been designed with greater anti - apoptotic activity and reduced anticoagulant activity relative to wild - type APC [ 2 ] .
Whether these genetically engineered variants actually provide superior pharmacological properties remains to be elucidated in vivo .
Such investigations may allow the design of therapeutic APC variants with decreased anticoagulant activity to reduce the risk of bleeding on the one hand , but also with normal cytoprotective properties in order to retain full beneficial effects on sepsis outcome .

Here we report the synthesis of a heterocyclic sulfonamide CA inhibitor and of the metal complexes containing main group metal ions , such as Be ( II ) , Mg ( II ) , AI ( III ) , Zn ( II ) , Cd ( II ) and Hg ( II ) and the new sulfonamide as well as 5 - amino - l , 3 , 4thiadiazole - 2 - sulfonamide as ligands .

Some of them ( but not the parent sulfonamides ) strongly lowered IOP in rabbits:__entity__ when administered as a 2 % solution into the eye .
Introduction Sulfonamides possessing carbonic anhydrase ( CA , EC 4 . 2 . 1 . 1 ) inhibitory properties [ 2 ] such as acetazolamide 1 , methazolamide 2 , ethoxzolamide 3 and dichlorophenamide 4 have been used for more than 40 years as pressure lowering systemic drugs in the treatment of open - angle glaucoma [ 3 , 4 ] .
Their effect is due to inhibition of at least two CA isozymes present within cilliary processes of the eye , ie , CA II and CA IV , which is followed by lowered bicarbonate formation and reduction of aqueous humor secretion [ 5 - 7 ] .
Their main drawback is constituted by side effects such as fatigue , augmented diuresis , or paresthesias , due to CA inhibition in other tissues / organs than the target one , ie , the eye [ 8 ] .

The above - mentioned side effects are absent in the case in which the inhibitor has topical activity , and is applied directly into the eye .
This route has been demonstrated only in 1983 by Maren ' s group [ 9 ] and was followed by the development of the first clinical agent of this type , dorzolamide 5 [ 10 , 11 ] .
Dorzolamide ( Trusopt ) has been introduced in clinical use in 1995 in USA and Europe and it constituted the beginning of a radically new treatment of glaucoma , devoid of the severe side effects observed with the systemic inhibitors [ 4 - 6 ] .
The success of topical antiglaucoma CA inhibitors fostered much research in the synthesis and clinical evaluation of other types of such compounds [ 12 - 15 ] .

Metal Complexes of Heterocyclic Sulfonamides : A New Class ofAntiglaucoma Agents
On the other hand , metal complexes of heterocyclic sulfonamides of type 1 - 5 have been recently prepared by two groups 16 - 20 ] , and it was proved that they possess much stronger CA inhibitory properties than the sulfonamides from which they were prepared 18 - 22 ] .
Although the mechanism of CA inhibition of the metal complexes is presently unknown , it was hypothesized that their increased inhibitory power might be due to two processes , occurring separately or in concert , ie , ( i ) dissociation of the complex inhibitor in sulfonamide anions and metal ions ( in diluted solution ) , which in turn both interact thereafter with the enzyme , at different binding sites , and ( ii ) direct interaction of the undissociated complex with the enzyme , and more specifically with the hydrophilic patch at the entrance of CA II active site [ 23 ] , this being the isozyme most susceptible to inhibition with this class of compounds [ 2 , 22 ] .
Whether initially the first mechanism of action mentioned above was favored by us [ 22 ] , recent evidences suggested that the undissociated complex might be the inhibitory species , at least for some isozymes [ 24 ] .
Since metal complexes are much more inhibitory than the parent sulfonamide from which they were prepared , it appeared of interest to test whether this property might be useful for their use in lowering IOP in experimental animals and whence as a possible glaucoma therapy .
Recently we proved [ 25 , 26 ] that some metal complexes of heterocyclic sulfonamides ( which themselves do not possess IOP lowering properties ) act as very powerful such agents when administered as diluted solutions directly into the eye of experimental animals , and would thus offer the possibility of developing such totally novel drugs .
Here we report the synthesis of a heterocyclic sulfonamide possessing strong CA inhibitory properties , ie , 5 - ( chloroacetamido ) - l , 3 , 4 - thiadiazole - 2 - sulfonamide , and of the metal complexes of this sulfonamide and of 5 - amino - 1 , 3 , 4 - thiadiazole - 2 - sulfonamide , containing some main group metal ions .
The new compounds have been characterized by standard physico - chemical procedures , and were assayed as inhibitors of three CA isozymes , hCA I , hCA II and bCA IV ( h human:__entity__ ; b bovine:__entity__ ; these are the isozymes considered to play a critical role in aqueous humour secretion within the eye of higher vertebrates [ 2 - 5 ] ) .

solution was added the aqueous metal salt ( Zn ( II ) , Mg ( II ) , AI ( III ) , Cd ( II ) chlorides , and Be ( II ) , Pb ( II ) and Hg ( II ) nitrate ) solution , working in molar ratios RSOzNH - Mn + of 2 : 1 for the divalent cations and 3 : 1 for the trivalent cation , respectively .
The aqueous - alcoholic reaction mixture was heated on a steam bath for one hour , adjusting the pH at 7 if necessary , and after being cooled at 0 C the precipitated complexes were filtered and thoroughly washed with alcohol - water 1 : 1 ( v / v ) and air dried .
Yields were in the range of 85 - 90 % .
The obtained white powders of compounds 8 - 20 melted with decomposition at temperatures higher than 350 C , and were poorly soluble in water and alcohol , but had good solubilities in DMSO , DMF as well as mixtures of DMSO - water , DMF - water .
Pharmacology Carbonic anhydrase inhibition Initial rates of 4 - nitrophenyl acetate hydrolysis catalysed by different CA isozymes were monitored spectrophotometrically , at 400 rim , with a Cary 3 instrument interfaced with an IBM compatible PC [ 35 ] .
Solutions of substrate were prepared in anhydrous acetonitrile ; the substrate concentrations varied between 2 . 10 - 2 and 1 . 10 - 6 M , working at 25C .
A molar absorption coefficient of 18 , 400 M - l . cm - 1 was used for the 4 - nitrophenolate formed by hydrolysis , in the conditions of the experiments ( pH 7 . 40 ) , as reported in the literature [ 35 ] .
Non - enzymatic hydrolysis rates were always subtracted from the observed rates .
Duplicate experiments were done for each inhibitor concentration , and the values reported throughout the paper are the mean of such results .
Stock solutions of inhibitor ( 1 mM ) were prepared in distilled - deionized water with 1020 % ( v / v ) DMSO ( which is not inhibitory at these concentrations [ 2 ] ) and dilutions up to 0 . 01 nM were done thereafter with distilled - deionized water .
Inhibitor and enzyme solutions were preincubated together for 10 min at room temperature prior to assay , in order to allow for the formation of the E - I complex .
The inhibition constant KI was determined as described by Pocket and Stone [ 35 ] .
Enzyme concentrations were 3 . 3 nM for hCA II , l0 nM for hCA and 34 nM for bCA IV ( this isozyme has a decreased esterase activity [ 36 ] and higher concentrations had to be used for the - measurements ) .
Measurement of tonometric lOP Adult male New Zealand albino rabbits:__entity__ weighing 2 - 3 kg were used in the experiments ( three animals were used for each inhibitor studied ) .
The experimental procedures conform to the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Resolution on the use of animals .
The rabbits:__entity__ were kept in individual cages with food and water provided ad libitum .
The animals were maintained on a 12 h : 12 h light / dark cycle in a temperature controlled room , at 22 - 26 C .
Solutions of inhibitors ( 2 % , by weight ) were obtained in DMSOwater ( 2 : 3 , v / v ) due to the low water solubility of some of these derivatives .
Control experiments with DMSO ( at the same concentration as that used for obtaining the inhibitors solutions showed that it does not possess IOP lowering or increasing effects .
IOP was measured using a Digilab 30R pneumatonometer ( BioRad , Cambridge , MA , USA ) as described by Maren ' s group [ 37 - 39 ] .
The pressure readings were matched with two - point standard pressure measurements at least twice each day using a Digilab Calibration verifier .
All IOP measurements were done by the same investigator with the same tonometer .
One drop of 0 . 2 % oxybuprocaine hydrochloride ( novesine , Sandoz ) diluted 1 " 1 with saline was instilled in each eye immediately before each set of pressure measurements .
IOP was measured three times at each time interval , and the means reported .
IOP was measured first immediately before drug administration , then at 30 min after the instillation of the pharmacological agent , and then each 30 minutes for a period of several hours .
For all IOP experiments drug was administered to only one eye , leaving the contralateral eye as an untreated control .
The ocular hypotensive activity is expressed as the average difference in IOP between the treated and control eye , in this way minimizing the diurnal , seasonal and interindividual variations commonly observed in the rabbit:__entity__ [ 37 - 39 ] .
All data are expressed as mean SE , using a one - tailed test .
Results and Discussion Reaction of 5 - amino - l , 3 , 4 - thiadiazole - 2 - sulfonamide 6 [ 19b ] with chloroacteyl chloride in the presence of pyridine afforded 5 - ( chloroacetamido ) - l , 3 , 4 - thiadiazole - 2 - sulfonamide 7 , by the procedure already reported by Young et al .
[ 34 ] ( Scheme 1 ) .
The sulfonamide 7 has been characterized by elemental analysis and spectroscopic methods which confirmed its structure ( only its m . p . has been reported in ref . [ 34 ] ) .
The sodium salt of sulfonamides 6 and 7 , obtained in situ from the corresponding sulfonamide and sodium hydroxide , were then used for the preparation of coordination compounds , containing the following metal ions : Be ( II ) , Mg ( II ) , Al ( III ) , Zn ( II ) , Cd ( II ) and Hg ( II ) .
Mention should be made that although 5 - amino - l , 3 , 4 - thiadiazole - 2 - sulfonamide 6 is the parent compound of important sulfonamide CA inhibitors , such as acetazolamide , benzolamide , methazolamide , etc . , its coordination chemistry has been scarcely investigated up to now [ 22 , 40 ] .
The new complexes prepared in this work are shown in Table I . Both compounds containing the sulfonamide - deprotonated species of sulfonamide 7 ( LH ) , as well as complexes in which the anion of 5amino - 1 , 3 , 4 - thiadiazole - 2 - sulfonamide ( tda ) act as ligands , have been prepared .
In fact in another work [ 40 ] it was documented that in some cases , sulfonamides derived from this ring system may undergo hydrolysis to

The new complexes have also been characterized by spectroscopic , conductimetric and thermogravimetric measurements ( Table II ) .
By comparing the IR spectra of the complexes and the corresponding ligands , the following observations should be made : ( i ) the shift of the two sulfonamido vibrations ( both the symmetric as well as the the assymetric one ) , towards lower wavenumbers in the spectra of the complexes , as compared to the spectra of the corresponding ligand ( Table II ) , as already documented previously for similar complexes [ 13 - 22 ] .
This is a direct indication that the deprotonated sulfonamido 310

moieties of the ligands interacts with the metal ions in the newly prepared coordination compounds ; ( ii ) the amide vibrations ( the most intense such bands at 1670 - 1680 cm - 1 ) of ligand 7 appear unchanged in the IR spectra of complexes 15 - 20 ( data not shown ) , suggesting that these moieties do not participate in coordination of the metal ions ; ( iii ) the C - N stretching vibration in the spectra of the prepared complexes is shifted with 5 - 20 cm - 1 towards lower wavenumbers , as compared to the same vibration in the spectra of sulfonamides 6 and 7 , indicating that one of the endocyclic nitrogens of the thiadiazolic ring ( presumably N3 ) acts as donor atom , as already documented by X - ray crystallographic and spectroscopic determinations on complexes of other sulfonamides ( such as 1 - 3 ) with divalent metal ions [ 13 - 22 ] ( Table II ) ; ( iv ) changes in the region 3100 - 3160 cm - , as the bands present in the spectra of sulfonamides 6 , 7 are present in the spectra of complexes 8 - 20 too , but they are not well resolved , and have a smaller intensity .
This is probably due to deprotonation of the SO2NH2 moiety and participation in the binding of cations ; ( v ) the amino vibrations from 3320 cm - in the spectra of 6 appear unchanged in the spectra of its complexes 8 - 14 ( data not s . hown ) .
In the 1H - NMR spectra of compound 6 and its metal complexes , the signal of the amino group has been evidenced as a broad singlet centered at 4 . 54 ppm ( Table II ) , which is not exchangeable by addition of D20 into the NMR tube , in contrast to the sulfonamido NH2 protons ( which readily exchange ) .
This proves that the 5 - amino moiety is not involved in binding the metal ions , as already shown in the X - ray crystallographic work of the complex [ Zn ( tda ) z ( NH3 ) ] . H20 previously reported [ 40 ] .
For sulfonamide 7 the CONH proton resonates as a singlet at 12 . 22 ppm .
In complexes 15 - 20 only very minor shifts of this signal were evidenced ( Table II ) , proving basically that the CONH moiety does not interact with the metal ions in these complexes .

a In KBr ; bin DMSO - d6 ; A the signal of the 5 - amino group of 6 ( appearing in the ligand at 4 . 54 ppm as a broad singlet ) appears at the same chemical shift ( 4 . 50 4 . 55 ppm ) in complexes 8 - 14 ; cWeight loss between 70 - 250 C ; d mM solution , in DMF , at 25C ; e No weight loss seen under 250 C ; fCorresponding to three lattice water molecules lost at 70 - 110C , and gCorresponding to two coordinated water molecules , lost at 160 - 180 C .
Thermogravimetric analysis showed the presence of uncoordinated water molecules in the molecule of complex 9 ( the three waters were lost in a single step , between 70 - 110 C ) and of coordinated water in the molecules of the lead ( II ) derivatives 13 and 20 .
All these compounds behaved as non - electrolytes in DMF as solvent ( Table II ) .
Mention should be made that the Mg ( II ) complex of sulfonamide 7 could not be isolated .
Instead , only the correponding complex of 5 - amino - l , 3 , 4 - thiadiazole has been obtained from reaction mixtures containing magnesium salts and the sodium salt of 7 , probably due to a metal ion assisted hydrolysis of 7 to 6 and chloroacetate .
Generally such hydrolytic processes involve highly acidic conditions and prolonged heating of the 5 - alkylamido - 1 , 3 , 4 - thiadiazole - 2 - sulfonamide derivatives [ 41 ] , but they might become milder by taking into account the putative catalytic effect of Mg2 + ions reported here .
The data shown above lead to the conclusion that ligand 7 shares a common coordination chemistry with acetazolamide 1 with which it is structurally related , whereas 6 probably also behaves similarly to acetazolamide in the sense that the 5 - amino group seems not to be involved in coordinating metal ions , at 311

least in the complexes reported by us here ( and also in the compound characterized by X - ray crystallography mentioned above [ 40 ] ) .
Thus , in all complexes reported here these sulfonamides ( as monodeprotonated species at the SO2NH 2 moieties ) act as bidentate ligands , through the endocyclic N - 3 and the NH - groups .
The proposed formulae of the new complxes are shown below .
Except for the two Pb ( II ) complexes 13 and 20 , as well as the AI ( III ) derivatives 14 and 16 , which presumably are pseudo - octahedral , the other derivatives are supposed to contain tetrahedral M ( II ) ions .

The compounds 6 - 20 together with the standard CA inhibitors 1 - 5 were assayed for inhibition against three isozymes , hCA I , hCA II and bCA IV ( Table III ) .
As seen from the above data , the chloracetamido derivative is more inhibitory than acetazolamide , methazolamide and dichlorophenamide , whereas the unacylated compound 6 is less inhibitory than the above sulfonamides .
The metal complexes 820 are much more inhibitory than the sulfonamides from which they derive 6 , 7 and than all other simple sulfonamides assayed .
They behave similarly to the metal complexes of acetazolamide , methazolamide or dorzolamide previously reported by this group , which were all more inhibitory than the parent sulfonamide from which were prepared [ 16 - 22 , 40 ] .
Particularly strong inhibition was observed for the Zn ( II ) , Hg ( II ) , Pb ( II ) and Cd ( II ) complexes , especially against CA II and CA IV , the isozymes critical for aqueous humor formation .
In vivo IOP lowering experiments were done in rabbits:__entity__ with some of the new compounds prepared in the present work , such as the sulfonamides 6 and 7 , and their Zn ( II ) complexes , which were among the strong CA II and CA IV inhibitors in the obtained series .

As seen from the above data , the sulfonamides 6 and 7 are totally ineffective as lOP lowering agents , similarly to the classical clinically used inhibitors of type 1 - 5 [ 2 , 3 ] .
On the other hand , dorzolamide , the first topical sulfonamide used clinically in the treatment of glaucoma is an effective such agent , with a decrease of lOP of around 4 mm Hg , one hour after administration directly into the eye ( Table IV ) .
From the data of this table , it is obvious that the metal complexes of heterocyclic sulfonamides investigated by us behave as much more effective IOP lowering agents than dorzolamide , and their effect is generally longerlasting ( Fig . 1 ) .
A last remark should be made about the possible mechanism of action of the new class of IOP lowering agents .
Obviously , their activity is due to inhibition of CA isozymes present in the cilliary processes within the eye , similarly to other topically active sulfonamides [ 2 - 6 ] .
The fact that the sulfonamide per se is inactive via the topical route , whereas the metal complexes result much better than the drug

Preliminary results from this laboratory indicate that the metal complexes of topically active sulfonamides show also increased lOP lowering effects with respect to the complexes prepared in the present study [ 42 ] .
Our hypothesis is that the presence of the metal ion in the molecules of these complex inhibitors induces a dramatic change in their physico - chemical properties as compared to those of the parent sulfonamide .
This phenomenon is certainly governed by the strong polarization induced by the metal ions .
In this way , it is quite probable that the right balance between the lipo - and hydrosolubility of these compounds is achieved , which has been considered to be the critical factor for not observing topical activity in the classical CA inhibitors , such as acetazolamide , methazolamide and ethoxzolamide , which were either too lipophilic or too hy . drosoluble [ 2 , 3 ] .
So , by choosing different metal ions and diverse sulfonamides , much larger possibilities arise to finely tune the pharmacological properties which strongly influence the value of a drug .
In conclusion we describe here a novel class of lOP lowering agents , ie , the metal complexes of sulfonamide CA inhibitors .
These derivatives appear to be very active and longer lasting than the drug dorzolamide , and might constitute the premises for a new generation of antiglaucoma drugs .

Introduction .
Several organotin cysteaminates ( aminoethylthiolates ) have been studied 1 - 4 as compounds with potentially high biological activity , but little is known about their cytotoxic effect .
The present paper reports the synthesis and characterization of di - and tri - n - butyltin cysteaminates and their N , N - dimethyl analogues and their in vitro cytotoxicity .
It is shown that a correct evaluation of the biological activity of organotin compounds remains 5 often hampered by their low water solubility .
Therefore , we focused on the synthesis of derivatives with potentially higher water solubility by introducing ionic groups into the molecule by protonation or quatemization of a nitrogen atom .

C resonances were assigned on the basis of the values of n J ( 119 Sn , 13 C ) coupling constants and standard 13 C - APT techniques utilization in agreement with ref . .
The values of 119 Sn chemical shifts are found in the interval characteristic for fourcoordinated tin 6 , 7 .
The values of the coupling constants j ( 1 lqSn , 13C ) agree with the structure proposed .
Compound 3 is characterized by a somewhat larger upfield shift , close to the upper limit of the above mentioned interval , together with a high value of 1j ( l lqSn , 13C ) ( 495 Hz ) .
67 The C - Sn - C angle , est ' mated , from this value of coupling constant is 124 According to ref . this behaviour can be due to intermolecular association increasing the coordinatitn number of tin in concentrated solutions , as suggested by the concentration dependence of tS ( Sn ) and cryoscopic measurements in benzene .
The values of the 6 ( SN ) chemical shifts of compounds 1 , 2 and 4 only slightly differ from the ( 15N ) values of the free cysteamine .
The significantly larger i ( 15N ) chemical shift of compound 3 is however much lower than those of compounds 5 , 6 and 7 containing a N interaction in compounds 1 tetracoordinated nitrogen atom .
It can be stated that the Sn 4 is negligible or only very weak in chlorofom solutions .
This conclusion is not in contradiction with the proved Sn N interaction found in the solid state 8 .

It is evident from Table 3 that all studied compounds exhibit excellent cytostatic activities , except compound 7 showing only moderate activity .
Compounds 1 6 are more active than cisplatin and , in most cases , than etoposide and 5 - fluorouracil .
Their activity is lower than that of doxorubicin and methotrexate in most cases for the studied cancer cell lines .
The very limited set of acquired activity values show that the activity of tri - n - butyltin are higher than those of di - n - butyl analogues ( 1 > 3 , 2 > 4 ) for all cell lines , especially compounds against WiDr .
The N , N - dimethyl derivatives exhibit an activity comparable to or somewhat higher than that of unmethylated compounds .
Compound 8 , with a quaternized nitrogen , exhibits the lowest cytotoxic activities , approximatively 9 times lower than compound 2 .
It might be underlined that the ionic more water - soluble compounds 5 and 6 are not more active than the uncharged analogs 1 - 4 , whereas the hydrophilic organotin polyoxacarboxylates exhibit much higher in vitro activities than other organotin carxylates 51 Compounds 5 and 6 ( with a protonated nitrogen ) exhibit activities comparable or even considerably higher ( compound 5 ) against EVSA - T than the corresponding unprotonated compounds .
Compound 7 ( with a quaternized nitrogen ) exhibits the lowest cytostatic activities , approximately 9 times should however be mentioned that another ionic organotin lower than compound 2 .
It compound , bis ( dicyclohexyl ) ammonium bis ( 2 , 6 - pyridinecarboxyla , to ) di - n - butylstannate , where the organotin moiety is this time anionic , is also as active as the uncharged analog l .

Genomic - Bioinformatic Analysis of Transcripts Enriched in the Third - Stage Larva of the Parasitic Nematode Ascaris:__entity__ suum:__entity__
Abstract
Differential transcription in Ascaris:__entity__ suum:__entity__ was investigated using a genomic - bioinformatic approach .
A cDNA archive enriched for molecules in the infective third - stage larva ( L3 ) of A:__entity__ .:__entity__ suum:__entity__ was constructed by suppressive - subtractive hybridization ( SSH ) , and a subset of cDNAs from 3075 clones subjected to microarray analysis using cDNA probes derived from RNA from different developmental stages of A:__entity__ .:__entity__ suum:__entity__ .
The cDNAs ( n = 498 ) shown by microarray analysis to be enriched in the L3 were sequenced and subjected to bioinformatic analyses using a semi - automated pipeline ( ESTExplorer ) .
Using gene ontology ( GO ) , 235 of these molecules were assigned to ' biological process ' ( n = 68 ) , ' cellular component ' ( n = 50 ) , or ' molecular function ' ( n = 117 ) .
Of the 91 clusters assembled , 56 molecules ( 61 . 5 % ) had homologues / orthologues in the free - living nematodes Caenorhabditis:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ and C:__entity__ .:__entity__ briggsae:__entity__ and / or other organisms , whereas 35 ( 38 . 5 % ) had no significant similarity to any sequences available in current gene databases .
Transcripts encoding protein kinases , protein phosphatases ( and their precursors ) , and enolases were abundantly represented in the L3 of A:__entity__ .:__entity__ suum:__entity__ , as were molecules involved in cellular processes , such as ubiquitination and proteasome function , gene transcription , protein - protein interactions , and function .
In silico analyses inferred the C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ orthologues / homologues ( n = 50 ) to be involved in apoptosis and insulin signaling ( 2 % ) , ATP synthesis ( 2 % ) , carbon metabolism ( 6 % ) , fatty acid biosynthesis ( 2 % ) , gap junction ( 2 % ) , glucose metabolism ( 6 % ) , or porphyrin metabolism ( 2 % ) , although 34 ( 68 % ) of them could not be mapped to a specific metabolic pathway .
Small numbers of these 50 molecules were predicted to be secreted ( 10 % ) , anchored ( 2 % ) , and / or transmembrane ( 12 % ) proteins .
Functionally , 17 ( 34 % ) of them were predicted to be associated with ( non - wild - type ) RNAi phenotypes in C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ , the majority being embryonic lethality ( Emb ) ( 13 types ; 58 . 8 % ) , larval arrest ( Lva ) ( 23 . 5 % ) and larval lethality ( Lvl ) ( 47 % ) .
A genetic interaction network was predicted for these 17 C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ orthologues , revealing highly significant interactions for nine molecules associated with embryonic and larval development ( 66 . 9 % ) , information storage and processing ( 5 . 1 % ) , cellular processing and signaling ( 15 . 2 % ) , metabolism ( 6 . 1 % ) , and unknown function ( 6 . 7 % ) .
The potential roles of these molecules in development are discussed in relation to the known roles of their homologues / orthologues in C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ and some other nematodes .
The results of the present study provide a basis for future functional genomic studies to elucidate molecular aspects governing larval developmental processes in A:__entity__ .:__entity__ suum:__entity__ and / or the transition to parasitism .
Introduction
Parasitic nematodes are of major socio - economic importance in animals .
For example , hundreds of millions of people:__entity__ are infected with geohelminths ( soil - transmitted worms ) , such as blood - feeding hookworms Ancylostoma:__entity__ duodenale:__entity__ and / or Necator:__entity__ americanus:__entity__ , Trichuris:__entity__ trichiura:__entity__ and Ascaris spp .
[ 1 ] , causing serious adverse effects on human:__entity__ health , particularly in children:__entity__ .
Similarly , parasitic nematodes of livestock , such as pigs:__entity__ , also cause substantial economic losses due to subclinical and clinical diseases , with billions of dollars spent annually on the treatment and control of gastro - intestinal nematodes .
In addition to the socioeconomic impact that these parasites have , there is potential for the emergence of resistance in them against all of the main classes of ( nematocidal ) compounds used to treat the diseases they cause [ 2 ] - [ 5 ] .
Therefore , there is a significant need to work toward discovering new compounds to control these parasites .
Gaining an improved understanding of the molecular basis of parasite development provides such an avenue .
Compared with the free - living nematode Caenorhabditis:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ , there is very little information on fundamental molecular aspects of development in parasitic nematodes [ 6 ] - [ 8 ] .
Since the genome sequence of C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ was published in 1998 [ 9 ] , many aspects of the molecular biology of this nematode have been elucidated .
For instance , microarray analyses have been used to examine developmental and gender - enriched gene expression [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , and the functions of more than 96 % of the C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ genes have been assessed by double - stranded RNA interference ( RNAi , or gene silencing ; [ 12 ] ) [ 13 ] - [ 18 ] .
Comparative analyses of genetic data sets have shown that parasitic nematodes usually share ~ 50 - 70 % of genes with C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ ( e . g . , [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] ) .
There is similarity in other features ( such as basic body plan and moulting ) between C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ and parasitic nematodes , suggesting that some molecular pathways are relatively conserved [ 8 ] , [ 21 ] .
Understanding the pathways linked to basic nematode biology and development could have important implications for finding new ways of disrupting these pathways and thus facilitate the identification of new drug targets .
Despite the advances in genomic technologies [ 7 ] , [ 22 ] - [ 29 ] and the study of C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ , there is a paucity of information on the genomics of parasitic nematodes of animals , particularly in relation to development .
Also considering the major socioeconomic impact of Ascaris and ascariasis in humans:__entity__ and pigs:__entity__ [ 30 ] - [ 32 ] , several characteristics , including the large size of the adult worm ( providing the opportunity of investigating individual organ systems and tissues ) , the ability to maintain Ascaris in the pig:__entity__ , store eggs and culture larvae in vitro for relatively long periods of time ( months to years ) [ 32 ] as well as the discovery that RNAi achieves " cross - species " gene silencing for a selected number of genes [ 33 ] , [ 34 ] and the imminent genome sequence ( http : / / www . sanger . ac . uk / Projects / Helminths / ) all indicate that Ascaris could serve as a powerful model system for investigating reproductive and developmental processes in nematodes .
In the present study , Ascaris from pigs:__entity__ was used to study molecules abundantly transcribed in the infective third - stage larva ( L3 ) .
Following the oral ingestion of Ascaris eggs by the host ( human:__entity__ or pig:__entity__ ) , L3s are released and then invade / penetrate predominantly the caecal wall [ 35 ] to then undergo hepato - pulmonary migration , after which ultimately the adult females and males establish and develop in the small intestine [ 36 ] , [ 37 ] .
The molecular mechanisms linked to host invasion and parasite development are largely unknown .
Here , we constructed an L3 - enriched cDNA library using the method of suppressive - subtractive hybridization ( SSH ) , explored transcription of a representative subset of molecules by microarray analysis and conducted bioinformatic analyses to characterize these molecules , map them to biochemical pathways and predict genetic interactions based on comparisons with C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ and / or other organisms .
Materials and Methods
Production of Different Developmental Stages of Ascaris
Experimental pigs:__entity__ ( 8 - 12 weeks of age ) were purchased from and maintained in the Experimental Animal Center of South China Agricultural University .
These pigs:__entity__ were treated humanely , according to the Animal Ethics procedures and guidelines of the People ' s Republic of China .
Adult worms ( males and females ) of A:__entity__ .:__entity__ suum:__entity__ were collected from the small intestines of pigs:__entity__ from an abattoir in Shenzhen , China .
Infective eggs and infective L3s of A:__entity__ .:__entity__ suum:__entity__ were produced according to the methods described previously [ 38 ] .
In brief , eggs from the uteri of adult females of A:__entity__ .:__entity__ suum:__entity__ were collected and incubated at 28 degrees C for 28 days to allow them to develop to infective eggs ( containing infective L3s ) .
To obtain pure infective L3s , 7 . 5 % v / v sodium hypochlorite was used to treat the larvated eggs at 37 degrees C overnight and then the eggs were shaken with glass - beads ; then , the exsheathed L3s and shells were separated by density gradient centrifugation using lymphocyte separating medium ( LSM ) [ 38 ] .
Following the experimental infection of helminth - free pigs:__entity__ with infective Ascaris eggs as described previously [ 39 ] , the L3s from livers and in lungs as well as L4s in intestines were isolated according to an established method [ 40 ] .
All parasite materials were snap - frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to storage at - 70 degrees C .
Construction of the cDNA Library by Subtractive - Suppressive Hybridization ( SSH )
Total RNA was isolated from adult females and males , different larval stages or eggs of A:__entity__ .:__entity__ suum:__entity__ using TriPure reagent ( Roche ) as recommended by the manufacturer .
Equal amounts of total RNA from each stage or sex were pooled .
The mRNA was isolated using the Oligotex mRNA Kit ( Qiagen ) , following the manufacturer ' s protocol .
SSH was carried out using the PCR - Select cDNA Subtraction kit ( Clontech ) , according to the manufacturer ' s protocol .
In brief , cDNA synthesized from mRNAs from infective L3s was subtracted against cDNA synthesized from the pooled mRNA from all other stages included herein .
The SSH library was constructed using infective L3s as the tester and pooled cDNAs from all other stages as the driver .
The effectiveness of this subtraction process has already been demonstrated in previous studies [ 41 ] , [ 42 ] .
The cDNA obtained following SSH was cloned into the pGEM - T Easy plasmid vector ( Promega ) and competent Escherichia:__entity__ coli:__entity__ ( JM109 ) transformed .
Positive clones , picked randomly ( based on blue / white selection ) , were grown overnight in Luria Bertani ( LB ) medium ( shaking , 37 degrees C ) .
Individual inserts were PCR - amplified using " nested primers " 1 and 2R from the Subtraction kit ( Clontech ) and examined by agarose electrophoresis .
Preparation of Microarray Slides
Clones ( n = 3075 ) from the subtracted library were picked and cultured overnight in LB containing ampicillin ( 1000 IU / ml ) in sealed 96 - well blocks .
Five micro l of culture suspension from each well were transferred into individual wells thermocycling ( 96 - well ) plates and the inserts PCR - amplified using primers 1 and 2R .
Following a 10 min denaturation step at 94 degrees C , the amplification proceeded for 25 cycles of 10 s at 94 degrees C , 30 s at 68 degrees C and 1 . 5 min at 72 degrees C , with a final extension for 5 min at 72 degrees C .
Products were resolved in agarose gels , ethanol precipitated , re - suspended in 16 micro l of " spotting solution " ( Shanghai BioStar Genechip , Inc ) to a final concentration of ~ 500 ng per micro l , before being printed on to glass slides ( in duplicate ) using a robotic arrayer .
Sixteen blanks ( using spotting solution only ) and the same number of negative ( irrelevant cDNAs with no relationship to Ascaris ) were also printed on to slides and served as negative controls ; beta - actin of A:__entity__ .:__entity__ suum:__entity__ served as a positive control to assess the efficiency of labeling and hybridization .
The slides were air - dried for 2 h , and cDNA in the spots were cross - linked at 254 mJ .
The printed slides were stored at 4 degrees C .
Labeling of cDNA Probes with Fluorescent Dyes , and Microarray Analysis
The cDNAs produced from total RNA from A:__entity__ .:__entity__ suum:__entity__ eggs , infective L3s , L3s isolated from pig:__entity__ liver or lung , fourth - stage larvae ( L4s ) , adult males or females [ as described in the section ' Construction of the cDNA Library by Subtractive - Suppressive Hybridization ( SSH ) ' ] were labeled with cyanine dyes .
Cy3 or Cy5 - dCTP was incorporated into cDNA produced from 30 micro g of total RNA by direct labeling in a reverse transcription reaction using an oligo ( dT ) primer .
Labeled cDNA was purified using DyeEx columns ( Qiagen ) .
Microarray slides were incubated with a pre - hybridization solution [ 5 x SSC , 1 % bovine:__entity__ serum albumin ( BSA ) , 0 . 1 % sodium dodecyl - sulphate ( SDS ) ] for 6 h at 42 degrees C .
After pre - hybridization , the microarray slides were incubated with ' pooled ' Cy3 and Cy5 - labeled probes in hybridization solution ( 5 x SSC , 1 % BSA , 0 . 1 % SDS ) , in the dark at 42 degrees C for 18 h , and then washed in solution I ( 1 x SSC , 0 . 2 % SDS ) for 10 min , followed by solution II ( 0 . 1 x SSC , 0 . 2 % SDS ) for 10 min at 60 degrees C , according to the protocols provided by Shanghai BioStar Genechip , Inc .
A " dye flip " was carried out to control for any bias in hybridization signal between the Cy - labeled cDNA probes ( produced for two distinct mRNA populations ) .
The slides were dried and scanned ( ScanArray 4000 scanner ) using image acquisition software ( Shanghai BioStar Genechip Inc . ) and a range of laser power and photo - multiplier tube intensities .
The mean hybridization signal ( derived from four replicates of the same array ) were corrected for background , normalized [ 43 ] , log2 - transformed and then subjected to statistical analysis employing the students t - test in a spreadsheet ( Excel , Microsoft , USA ) .
The microarray data were analysed for differential cDNA hybridization ( > 2 . 0 - fold to 114 . 3 - fold ) between L3 and each of the other stages ( eggs , lung and liver L3s , L4 , adult female and adult male ) .
Verification of Differential Hybridization by Reverse Transcription - Coupled Polymerase Chain Reaction ( RT - PCR ) Analysis
For a subset ( n = 17 ) of representative ESTs ( rESTs ) , RT - PCR was used to verify the differential transcription recorded by microarray analysis .
Double - stranded cDNA was synthesized from total RNA ( separately ) from each stage or sex of A:__entity__ .:__entity__ suum:__entity__ using reverse transcriptase ( Superscript III , Invitrogen ) .
Briefly , 5 micro g of total RNA were added to 14 micro l of H2O and 1 micro l of oligo d ( T ) n = 12 - 18 primer ( 0 . 5 micro g / micro l ) , heated to 70 degrees C for 10 min and chilled on ice .
First - and second - strand cDNAs were synthesized via the addition of 4 micro l of first - strand cDNA buffer ( 250 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 3 , 375 mM KCl and 15 mM MgCl2 ) , 2 micro l of 0 . 1 M dithiothreitol , and 1 micro l of 10 mM of each dNTP , followed by an incubation at 25 degrees C ( 10 min ) , 42 degrees C ( 50 min ) and 70 degrees C ( 15 min ) .
One - tenth of each double - stranded cDNA produced was then used as a template in the PCR .
The transcripts were amplified from individual cDNAs by PCR using oligonucleotide primers ( sequences available upon request ) designed to each EST .
The PCR amplification of a portion ( 209 bp ) of the beta - actin gene ( accession no . BI594141 ) using forward primer ( 5 ' - CTCGAAACAAGAATACGATG - 3 ' ) and reverse primer ( 5 ' - ACATGTGCCGTTGTATGATG - 3 ' ) , previously determined to be present in all developmental stages and both sexes of A:__entity__ .:__entity__ suum:__entity__ [ 44 ] , served as a positive control .
Samples without template ( no - DNA controls ) were included in each PCR run .
The following cycling conditions were employed : one cycle at 94 degrees C ( 5 min ) , 94 degrees C ( 30 s ) , 60 degrees C ( 30 s ) and 72 degrees C ( 30 s ) for 30 cycles , followed by a final extension of 70 degrees C ( 7 min ) .
Following the PCR , 5 micro l of individual amplicons were resolved in ethidium bromide - stained agarose gels ( 2 % ) and then photographed upon transillumination .
The relative band intensities were analyzed using UVIsoft Image Acquisition and Analysis software ( UVITEC ) .
The specificity and identity of individual amplicons were confirmed by direct sequencing using the same primers ( separately ) as employed for their amplification .
Sequencing and Bioinformatics Analyses
Clones from the SSH cDNA library with increased hybridization in microarray analysis to the infective L3 compared with other stages were sequenced using standard technology [ 45 ] .
The nucleotide sequences have been deposited in the GenBank database under accession numbers ES290984 - ES291074 .
Following the processing of the sequences ( i . e . , removal of vector sequences , quality assurance and clustering ) , contigs or singletons from individual clusters were subjected to BLASTx ( NCBI : www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov ) and BLASTn ( EMBL - EBI Parasite Genome Blast Server : www . ebi . ac . uk ) analysis to identify putative homologues in C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ , other nematodes and other organisms ( e - value of <= 1e - 05 ) .
Peptides inferred from ESTs were classified functionally using Interproscan ( available at http : / / www . ebi . ac . uk / InterProScan / ) employing the default search parameters .
WormBase ( www . wormbase . org ) was interrogated extensively for relevant information on C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ homologues / orthologues , including RNAi phenotypic , transcriptomic , proteomic and interactomic data .
ESTs with homologues / orthologues in C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ and other nematodes were also subjected to analysis employing the KEGG Orthology - Based Annotation System ( KOBAS ) ( www . kobas . cbi . pku . edu . cn ) , which predicts the biochemical pathways in which molecules are involved .
The open reading frames ( ORFs ) inferred from selected ESTs with orthologues in C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ were also subjected to " secretome analysis " using the program SignalP v . 2 . 0 www . cbs . dtu . dk / services / SignalP / ) , employing both the neural network and hidden Markov models to predict signal peptides and / or anchors [ 46 ] - [ 48 ] .
Also , transmembrane domains were predicted using the program TMHMM ( www . cbs . dtu . dk / services / TMHMM / ; [ 49 ] - [ 51 ] ) , and subcellular localization inferred employing the program WoLF PSORT ( http : / / wolfpsort . org / ; [ 52 ] ) .
The method established by Zhong and Sternberg [ 53 ] was used to predict the interactions for C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ orthologues of the L3 - enriched molecules from Ascaris .
In brief , interaction , phenotypic , expression and gene ontology data from fruitfly:__entity__ , yeast:__entity__ , mouse:__entity__ and human:__entity__ were integrated using a na i ve Bayesian model to predict genetic interactions among C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ genes ( [ 45 ] , [ 53 ] ; Zhong and Sternberg , unpublished ) .
The predicted networks resulting from the analyses were saved in a graphic display file ( gdf ) format and examined using the graph exploration system available at http : / / graphexploration . cond . org / .
Images were labeled and saved in the joint photographic experts group ( jpeg ) format .
Results
To identify molecules transcribed abundantly in the L3 of A:__entity__ .:__entity__ suum:__entity__ , an enriched cDNA library was constructed by SSH .
From a total of 3075 clones from this library , 2921 ( 95 % ) were shown to contain an insert ( which could be amplified by PCR ) .
From 2671 ( 92 % ) of these clones , amplicons representing single bands of ~ 400 to 600 bp in size were produced .
These latter amplicons were arrayed ( in duplicate ) on to slides and then hybridized with Cy3 - labeled L3 - cDNA or with Cy5 - labeled cDNA from eggs , liver / lung L3s , L4s , adult female or adult male of Ascaris .
Dye flip was conducted to verify the hybridization data .
Of the 2671 ( duplicate ) spots , 1526 had a significant difference in hybridization between infective L3 cDNA and cDNAs from all other stages or sexes of A:__entity__ .:__entity__ suum:__entity__ , of which 515 had a > 2 . 0 - fold increased hybridization for the L3 .
In order to independently verify the hybridization results in the microarray , a PCR - based analysis of a selected subset ( n = 17 ) clones was conducted using specific primer pairs .
Having verified the specificity and identity of individual amplicons by sequencing , PCR results were reproducible ( based on multiple runs on different days ) and ~ 94 % ( 16 of 17 ) concordant with those of the microarray analysis ( not shown ) .
There was complete concordance for representative clones associated with a differential signal of >= 3 . 0 - fold in the microarray .
The clones linked to the 515 spots representing increased transcription ( > 2 . 0 - fold ) in infective L3 compared with the other developmental stages or sexes included were subjected to sequencing .
The 498 sequences ( length : 550 +/- 115 bp ) determined were then subjected to detailed bioinformatic analyses .
There were 91 unique clusters ( accession numbers ES290984 - ES291074 ) , of which 55 were singletons ( sequences determined once ) .
Of 56 molecules ( 61 . 5 % ) with significant similarity to sequences other than A:__entity__ .:__entity__ suum:__entity__ in the databases interrogated , 50 ( 54 . 9 % ) had C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ or C:__entity__ .:__entity__ briggsae:__entity__ homologues , and six had similarity to ESTs already sequenced from ascaridoid and / or other parasitic nematodes , and / or other organisms ( Table 1 ) .
A significant proportion ( 38 . 4 % ) did not have any similarity in sequence to any organisms for which data are presently available .
Comparative analysis specifically against A:__entity__ .:__entity__ suum:__entity__ EST data sets ( n ~ 42 , 000 ) available in public databases confirmed independently that the majority of molecules ( > 60 % ) were present exclusively in the infective L3 stage or were orphans .
As gene ontology ( GO ) provides a hierarchy that unifies the descriptions of biological , cellular and molecular functions [ 54 ] , this approach was employed to predict the classification and gene function of molecules enriched in infective L3 of A:__entity__ .:__entity__ suum:__entity__ .
A summary of the GO categories of these molecules is displayed in Fig .
1 .
Of the 91 contigs , 32 ( 35 % ) could be functionally assigned to ' biological process ' ( n = 38 ) , ' cellular component ' ( n = 17 ) and ' molecular function ' ( n = 64 ) .
The most common subcategories were gluconeogenesis ( 13 % ) and metabolic process ( 13 % ) within ' biological process ' , extracellular region ( 24 % ) within ' cellular component ' , and catalytic activity ( 11 % ) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity ( 8 % ) within ' molecular function ' ( Table S1 ) .
A focused KOBAS analysis inferred the 50 C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ orthologues / homologues to be involved in apoptosis and insulin signaling ( 2 % ) , ATP synthesis ( 2 % ) , carbon metabolism ( 6 % ) , fatty acid biosynthesis ( 2 % ) , gap junction ( 2 % ) , glucose metabolism ( 6 % ) or porphyrin metabolism ( 2 % ) , although 34 ( 68 % ) of them could not be mapped to a specific metabolic pathway ( Table 2 ) .
Of these 50 molecules , small numbers were predicted to be secreted ( 10 % ) , anchored ( 2 % ) and / or transmembrane ( 12 % ) proteins ( Table 2 ) .
Functionally , 17 ( 34 % ) of the 50 molecules were associated with ( non - wild - type ) RNAi phenotypes in C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ , the majority displaying embryonic lethality ( Emb ) ( 13 types ; 58 . 8 % ) , larval arrest ( Lva ) ( 23 . 5 % ) and larval lethality ( Lvl ) ( 47 % ) ( Table 2 ) .
Extending this analysis , a relatively complex genetic interaction network was predicted for the 17 C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ orthologues ( i . e . , with non - wild - type RNAi phenotypes ) ( see Table S2 ) .
Statistically highly significant interactions were predicted for nine of the C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ genes ; the top five interactors are displayed in Fig .
2 .
The gene ontology categories for eight selected C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ genes ( F33D11 . 10 , F55A12 . 8 , kin - 2 , mec - 12 , mup - 2 , pab - 1 , rpl - 22 and T21B10 . 2 ) included : embryonic development , egg hatching , larval development and / or growth .
The other categories included : positive regulation of growth rate ( F55A12 . 8 , kin - 2 , mup - 2 , pab - 1 , rpl - 22 and T21B10 . 2 ) and gamete generation and locomotory behaviour ( kin - 2 , mup - 2 , pab - 1 and F55A12 . 8 , kin - 2 , mup - 2 , respectively ) .
The C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ homologue egl - 3 was predicted to be involved in proteolysis ( see www . wormbase . org ) .
All nine C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ orthologues were predicted to interact directly with a total of 296 ( range : 5 - 75 ) other genes and , in particular , a direct genetic interaction was predicted between pab - 1 and T21B10 . 2 ( Fig . 2 ) .
The 296 interactors were associated with embryonic and larval development ( n = 198 ; 66 . 9 % ) , information storage and processing ( n = 15 ; 5 . 1 % ) , cellular processes and signalling ( n = 45 ; 15 . 2 % ) and metabolism ( n = 18 ; 6 . 1 % ) ; the precise function of some of the interactors ( n = 20 ; 6 . 7 % ) is presently unknown ( Table S2 ) .
Discussion
The present study investigated transcripts in infective L3s of A:__entity__ .:__entity__ suum:__entity__ using a genomic - bioinformatic platform .
The focus was on comparisons with C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ homologues / orthologues , because the entire genome sequence of this nematode is known [ 9 ] and because there is a wealth of information on the localization and functionality of its molecules ( www . wormbase . org ; http : / / elegans . bcgsc . bc . ca / knockout . shtml ) .
The functions of most genes in C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ have been assessed using RNAi ( e . g . , [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 55 ] , [ 56 ] ) in the hermaphroditic stage , whereas there is a paucity of functional information available for Ascaris and other parasitic nematodes of animals [ 57 ] , [ 58 ] .
Following the microarray analysis of > 2500 ESTs from the SSH library , 498 cDNAs inferred to be enriched in the L3 , based on hybridization signal , were sequenced and subjected to comprehensive in silico analyses .
Of the 91 clusters of molecules categorized , 50 ( 54 . 9 % ) had C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ homologues / orthologues with loss - of - function phenotypes could be mapped to key pathways .
The statistically significant genetic interactions predicted for 9 of the 50 C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ orthologues [ namely egl - 3 , F33D11 . 10 , F55A12 . 8 , kin - 2 , mec - 12 , mup - 2 , pab - 1 , rpl - 22 and T21B10 . 2 ( = enol - 1 ) ] and the interaction network included genes encoding kinases , alpha - tubulins , enolases , troponin and other named and unnamed proteins .
Eight of these molecules ( enol - 1 , pab - 1 , F33D11 . 10 , rpl - 22 , F55A12 . 8 mec - 12 , mup - 2 and kin - 2 ) have known or predicted roles in embryonic and larval growth and development , gamete generation , locomotory behaviour or other biological processes in C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ ( see www . wormbase . org ) .
The enolase encoded by enol - 1 is predicted to play a role in glycolysis , gluconeogenesis , phenylalanine , tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis ( cf . [ 59 ] ) .
Since glucose is the main source for ATP production , the alteration in these key glycolytic enzymes may lead to cellular dysfunction , such as impaired ion - motive ATPase required to maintain potential gradients , operate pumps and maintain membrane lipid asymmetry [ 60 ] .
Bioinformatic analysis for transmembrane helices ( TMHMM ) and peptide signal sequences ( SignalP ) predicted ENOL - 1 to be a non - secreted protein localized to the cytoplasm ( cf . Table 2 ) .
Nonetheless , enolases are often detected in the excretory / secretory ( ES ) products of parasitic helminths , including adult A:__entity__ .:__entity__ suum:__entity__ [ 61 ] , and appear to play a role in the triggering of nitric oxide production by host cells .
The enol - 1 orthologue of C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ has been predicted to interact specifically with the polyadenylate binding protein gene , pab - 1 , inferred to be involved in coordinated gene transcription and expression during normal larval development [ 16 ] .
Poly ( A ) - binding proteins ( PABPs ) are recognized to be central to the regulation of mRNA translation and stability [ 62 ] .
Present evidence suggests that the expression of PAB - 1 is regulated by an oligo - pyrimidine tract in response to cell growth and relates to coordinated growth regulation in C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ [ 62 ] .
Furthermore , gene silencing of pab - 1 and its selected interactors ( see Fig . 2 ) leads to embryonic lethal ( Emb ) , slow growth ( Slo ) and sterile progeny ( Stp ) phenotypes ( see www . wormbase . org ) .
Another gene ( F33D11 . 10 ; EST code 4F10 ; see Table 2 ) which encodes an ATP - dependent RNA helicase and is associated with embryonic lethal ( Emb ) and larval lethal ( Lvl ) RNAi phenotypes , was shown to be highly transcribed in infective L3s of A:__entity__ .:__entity__ suum:__entity__ .
Helicases are involved in a variety of RNA metabolic processes , including translation initiation , pre - mRNA splicing , pre - rRNA processing , rRNA maturation and RNA degradation [ 63 ] , and are crucial for life cycle progression , sex determination and early embryogenesis in C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ [ 60 ] .
The high transcription levels of a homologue / orthologue in the L3 of A:__entity__ .:__entity__ suum:__entity__ might suggest a similar role in this ascaridoid .
Similarly , the coordination of the expression of a large number of genes is required for normal growth and cell proliferation during larval development .
The high transcription level for the ribosomal protein gene homologue rpl - 22 ( large subunit family member ; EST code 26G12 , see Table 2 ) in the infective L3 of A:__entity__ .:__entity__ suum:__entity__ compared with other developmental stages is likely to reflect the substantial rate of cell growth in this stage [ 64 ] .
The gene ( F55A12 . 8 , EST code 4G11 ; see Table 2 ) encoding an acetyl - transferase with a putative ATPase domain , shown to be enriched in the L3 of A:__entity__ .:__entity__ suum:__entity__ , was predicted to interact with 75 other genes all involved in energy production and / or RNA processing ( see Table S2 ) .
Several molecules involved in ATP synthesis and mitochondrial pathways ( e . g . , cytochrome oxidase c subunits 1 , 2 and 3 , ADP / ATP translocases , NADH dehydrogenases , ATPases and ATP synthetases ) have been reported previously to be highly represented in the L3 stage of Anisakis:__entity__ simplex:__entity__ [ 65 ] , thus supporting the proposal that substantial energy is required for larval development as well as the transition from the free - living to the parasitic stage and the invasion of the host .
There is also likely to be a substantial energy requirement for muscle contraction linked to larval motility in A:__entity__ .:__entity__ suum:__entity__ , as the L3s penetrate the caecal wall in the porcine host , before undergoing hepato - pulmonary migration [ 35 ] .
Accordingly , genes encoding a specialized tubulin expressed in mechanoreceptors ( mec - 12 , EST code 13E09 ) and a troponin ( mup - 2 , EST code 01G03 ; see Table 2 ) , both predicted to interact with a total number of 32 tubulin - and myosin - encoding genes , also supported a link to extensive muscle contraction and motility in A:__entity__ .:__entity__ suum:__entity__ L3s .
Also , neuroactive peptides are required to regulate the responsiveness of nematode larvae to mechanical stimuli [ 66 ] .
A homologue encoded by egl - 3 was shown to be highly transcribed in the L3 of A:__entity__ .:__entity__ suum:__entity__ ; EGL - 3 is predicted to be a pro - hormone convertase involved in the maturation of neuropeptides and could be associated with mechano - sensory responses and touch sensitivity linked to the host invasion .
A regulatory subunit of a cAMP - dependent protein kinase ( kin - 2 , EST code 22H01 ; see Table 2 ) was predicted to interact with 72 other genes all involved in diverse cellular processes , such as nuclear trafficking , and DNA replication and repair ( see Table S2 ) .
Based on gene ontology terms , kin - 2 is implicated in gamete generation , growth , larval development , post - embryonic body morphogenesis , signal transduction and / or protein amino acid phosphorylation ( see Table S2 ) .
Gene silencing of kin - 2 in C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ leads to phenotypes , such as larval lethal ( Lvl ) , larval arrest ( Lva ) , body morphology defect ( Bmd ) , dumpy ( Dpy ) , uncoordinated ( Unc ) and sterile progeny ( Stp ) ( www . wormbase . org ) , suggesting that its homologue in A:__entity__ .:__entity__ suum:__entity__ is central to larval maturation .
The KOBAS analysis predicted the protein KIN - 2 to be involved in the insulin - signaling pathway , previously implicated in controlling the exit from dauer in C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ and the activation of L3s of the canine:__entity__ hookworm:__entity__ , Ancylostoma:__entity__ caninum:__entity__ , following exsheathment [ 67 ] .
In a recent study , Brand and Hawdon [ 68 ] were able to inhibit ( with a phosphoinositide - 3 - OH - kinase inhibitor ) the activation of infective L3s of both of the hookworms Ancylostoma:__entity__ caninum:__entity__ and Ancylostoma:__entity__ ceylanicum:__entity__ via the insulin signaling pathway , thus lending some credence to the hypothesis that this pathway plays an critical role in regulating the transition from the free - living to the parasitic stage [ 68 ] .
Recently , it has been proposed that transcriptional and feeding responses to serum - stimulation in Ancylostoma:__entity__ caninum:__entity__ are regulated by parallel systems , with the insulin signaling pathway playing a significant role in the ' resumption of feeding ' in activated larvae [ 69 ] .
Protein kinases are also likely to be involved in pathways linked to sexual maturation in developing larvae .
As already proposed for adult stages of H:__entity__ .:__entity__ contortus:__entity__ [ 45 ] , the protein kinase gene cdk - 1 is predicted to play a pivotal role in the germline , oogenesis and spermiogenesis pathways of this parasitic nematode .
Other protein kinases , such as PEPCK , and phosphatases , were shown herein to be transcribed at high levels in the L3 stage compared with other developmental stages of A:__entity__ .:__entity__ suum:__entity__ ( see Table 2 ) , which is in accordance to findings reported recently for Anisakis:__entity__ simplex:__entity__ [ 65 ] .
Due to their major regulatory effects in eukaryotic signaling events and regulatory and sensory functions , protein kinases have been considered interesting targets for anti - parasitic drugs [ 70 ] .
In conclusion , this study has given some interesting insights into early molecular processes in the L3 of A:__entity__ .:__entity__ suum:__entity__ .
Approximately 60 % of the transcripts enriched in the L3 stage of A:__entity__ .:__entity__ suum:__entity__ have homologues / orthologues in C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ .
The bioinformatic analyses of selected molecules suggest that a complex genetic network regulates or controls larval growth and development in A:__entity__ .:__entity__ suum:__entity__ L3s , and some of these might be involved in or regulate the switch from the free - living to the parasitic stage .
Some caution is warranted in drawing conclusions regarding molecular mechanisms regulating the transition to parasitism in parasitic nematodes from information on C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ , as latter is a free - living nematode .
Also , while the method of data integration is essential for the reliable prediction of genetic interactions , it might limit the capacity of the approach somewhat to infer nematode - specific interactions .
As additional datasets of genes and gene functions become available for various parasitic nematodes , more informed inferences can be made regarding the functions of nematode - specific genes , particularly those involved in the transition to parasitism .
The imminent genome sequence of A:__entity__ .:__entity__ suum:__entity__ ( http : / / www . sanger . ac . uk / Projects / Helminths / ) should all assist in this endeavour .
Also , functional analysis of selected molecules representing selected ESTs identified herein , utilizing gene silencing approaches established recently [ 33 ] , [ 34 ] , could provide some insights into developmental processes in Ascaris and related ascaridoid nematodes and provide avenues for the development of novel approaches for their control .

Minocycline attenuates lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) - induced neuroinflammation , sickness behavior , and anhedonia
Abstract
Background
Activation of the peripheral innate immune system stimulates the secretion of CNS cytokines that modulate the behavioral symptoms of sickness .
Excessive production of cytokines by microglia , however , may cause long - lasting behavioral and cognitive complications .
The purpose of this study was to determine if minocycline , an anti - inflammatory agent and purported microglial inhibitor , attenuates lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) - induced neuroinflammation , sickness behavior , and anhedonia .
Methods
In the first set of experiments the effect of minocycline pretreatment on LPS - induced microglia activation was assessed in BV - 2 microglia cell cultures .
In the second study , adult ( 3 - 6 m ) BALB / c mice:__entity__ received an intraperitoneal ( i . p . ) injection of vehicle or minocycline ( 50 mg / kg ) for three consecutive days .
On the third day , mice:__entity__ were also injected ( i . p . ) with saline or Escherichia:__entity__ coli:__entity__ LPS ( 0 . 33 mg / kg ) and behavior ( i . e . , sickness and anhedonia ) and markers of neuroinflammation ( i . e . , microglia activation and inflammatory cytokines ) were determined .
In the final study , adult and aged BALB / c mice:__entity__ were treated with the same minocycline and LPS injection regimen and markers of neuroinflammation were determined .
All data were analyzed using Statistical Analysis Systems General Linear Model procedures and were subjected to one - , two - , or three - way ANOVA to determine significant main effects and interactions .
Results
Minocycline blocked LPS - stimulated inflammatory cytokine secretion in the BV - 2 microglia - derived cell line and reduced LPS - induced Toll - like - receptor - 2 ( TLR2 ) surface expression on brain microglia .
Moreover , minocycline facilitated the recovery from sickness behavior ( i . e . , anorexia , weight loss , and social withdrawal ) and prevented anhedonia in adult mice:__entity__ challenged with LPS .
Furthermore , the minocycline associated recovery from LPS - induced sickness behavior was paralleled by reduced mRNA levels of Interleukin ( IL ) - 1 beta , IL - 6 , and indoleamine 2 , 3 dioxygenase ( IDO ) in the cortex and hippocampus .
Finally , in aged mice:__entity__ , where exaggerated neuroinflammation was elicited by LPS , minocycline pretreatment was still effective in markedly reducing mRNA levels of IL - 1 beta , TLR2 and IDO in the hippocampus .
Conclusion
These data indicate that minocycline mitigates neuroinflammation in the adult and aged brain and modulates the cytokine - associated changes in motivation and behavior .
Background
The bi - directional communication between the immune system and the central nervous system ( CNS ) is necessary for mounting the appropriate immunological , physiological , and behavioral responses to immune stimulation [ 1 ] .
CNS innate immune cells including microglia and macrophages play integral roles in receiving and propagating inflammatory signals that are initiated at the periphery .
Activation of peripheral innate immune cells elicits the secretion of inflammatory cytokines , including interleukin ( IL ) - 1 , IL - 6 , and tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( TNF alpha . ) , that use neural [ 2 , 3 ] , humoral [ 4 ] and blood brain barrier pathways [ 5 ] to relay this signal to the CNS .
This inflammatory signal , in turn , induces CNS macrophages and microglia to produce the same cytokines [ 6 ] , which target neuronal substrates and elicit a sickness behavior syndrome that is normally adaptive and beneficial to the host [ 1 ] .
An amplified or excessive inflammatory cytokine response in the brain , however , is associated with a myriad of complications including cognitive dysfunction [ 7 - 10 ] , prolonged sickness behavior [ 11 - 14 ] , and depressive - like behavior [ 15 ] .
Microglia are primarily involved in immune surveillance [ 16 , 17 ] , but when activated have macrophage - like capabilities including phagocytosis , inflammatory cytokine production , and antigen presentation [ 18 ] .
Normally these neuroinflammatory changes are transient with microglia returning to a resting state as the immune stimulus is resolved .
Aging or neurological disease , however , may provide a brain environment where microglia are more " reactive or primed " to a peripheral immune challenge [ 19 ] .
Recent findings indicate that several markers of glial activation such as major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II , complement receptors , and scavenger receptors are increased in brain during normal aging [ 13 , 20 - 26 ] .
Furthermore , we and others have reported that a biological consequence of this reactive glial profile is an exaggerated neuroinflammatory response to innate immune challenge [ 9 , 10 , 12 - 14 , 27 , 28 ] .
Active microglia and CNS macrophages also contribute to the production of oxidative and neuroactive mediators that may influence behavior .
For instance , inflammatory cytokines in the CNS upregulate the enzyme IDO [ 29 , 30 ] , which metabolizes tryptophan ( TRP ) into L - kynurenine ( KYN ) [ 31 ] .
TRP degradation to KYN can reduce TRP levels that are required for serotonin synthesis [ 32 ] and can lead to the production of neuroactive mediators including 3 - hydroxykynurenine ( 3HK ) and quinolinic acid ( QUIN ) [ 31 ] .
High levels of 3HK and QUIN induce neuronal damage through oxidative stress [ 33 ] and over stimulation of N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) receptors [ 34 , 35 ] .
A recent study indicates that while several cell types in the CNS express IDO , only microglia maintain all the enzymes required to produce 3HK and QUIN [ 36 ] .
Because IDO mediated TRP degradation impacts both serotonergic and glutamatergic pathways , this may be an important mechanism underlying mood and behavior complications concomitant with inflammation [ 37 - 39 ] .
Because activated microglia are suspected to cause or exacerbate several neurodegenerative diseases , pharmacological strategies to suppress microglial activity are being explored as therapies .
Minocycline is a tetracycline derived antibiotic that has anti - inflammatory properties in the CNS that are separate from its antimicrobial action [ 40 ] .
Minocycline readily crosses the blood brain barrier and attenuates inflammation associated with microglial activation .
For example , minocycline blocks the deleterious effects of neuroinflammation on neurogenesis , long - term potentiation , and neuronal survival [ 41 - 43 ] .
The mechanism of action is unclear , but recent studies indicate that minocycline abrogates MAPkinase and NF kappa B dependent signaling pathways in primary microglia and microglia cell cultures [ 44 ] .
Moreover , in the brain of rats:__entity__ , minocycline abrogates microglial expression of CD11b and MHC II through a protein kinase - c dependent mechanism [ 45 ] .
This is relevant because minocycline attenuates neuroinflammation in several rodent models of disease including Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis [ 46 ] , Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis ( EAE ) [ 45 ] and MPTP - induced Parkinson ' s disease [ 47 ] .
However , the extent to which minocycline facilitates the recovery from cytokine - mediated sickness behavior is unknown .
The present study investigated the degree to which minocycline - an anti - inflammatory agent and purported microglial inhibitor - reduced LPS - induced neuroinflammation and sickness behavior .
We show that minocycline blocked LPS - stimulated inflammatory cytokine secretion in the BV - 2 microglia - derived cell line and reduced LPS - induced Toll - like - receptor - 2 ( TLR2 ) surface expression on brain microglia .
Moreover , our data show that minocycline pretreatment attenuated LPS - induced weight loss , social withdrawal , and anhedonia in adult mice:__entity__ .
The attenuation of sickness behavior was paralleled with minocycline dependent decrease in markers of neuroinflammation ( IL - 1 beta , TLR2 , and IDO ) in adult and aged mice:__entity__ .
These findings support our hypothesis that the ability to mitigate cytokine expression in the brain during systemic inflammatory events may be useful in preventing cognitive and behavioral deficits .
Methods
Animals
Male BALB / c mice:__entity__ , adults ( 3 month old ) and juvenile ( 3 - 4 week old ) were purchased from Harlan ( Indianapolis , IN ) .
For age comparisons , male BALB / c mice:__entity__ ( 3 - 4 and 20 - 22 month old ) were purchased from the National Institute on Aging specific pathogen free colony .
Upon arrival , mice:__entity__ were individually housed in polypropylene cages and maintained at 21 degrees C under a 12 h light : 12 h dark cycle with ad libitum access to water and rodent chow .
At the end of each study , mice:__entity__ were examined postmortem for gross signs of disease ( e . g . , splenomeglia or tumors ) .
Data from mice:__entity__ determined to be unhealthy were excluded from analysis ( < 5 % ) .
All procedures were in accordance with the National Institute of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by The Ohio State University Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee .
Cell culture
BV - 2 microglia cell lines were cultured in growth medium ( DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS , sodium bicarbonate 3 . 7 g / l , 200 mM glutamine , 100 U / ml penicillin G , 100 mu g / ml streptomycin , 0 . 25 mu g / ml fungizone ) as previously described [ 12 ] .
Cultures were maintained at 37 degrees C with 95 % humidity and 5 % CO2 and growth medium was replenished every third day until confluence .
Cultures were washed twice and supplemented with warm growth medium containing experimental treatments .
Cell viability was measured by the MTS cell proliferation assay according to the manufacturer ' s instructions ( Promega , Madison , WI ) .
CNS macrophage / microglia isolation
CNS macrophages and microglia were collected from whole brain homogenates as described previously [ 48 ] , but with several modifications .
Mice:__entity__ were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation and whole brains were collected .
Brains were homogenized in Hank ' s balanced salt solution ( HBSS ) pH 7 . 4 .
Brain homogenates were passed through a 70 mu m nylon cell strainer and centrifuged at 400 x g for 10 min .
Supernatants were removed and cell pellets were re - suspended in 70 % isotonic Percoll ( GE - healthcare , Uppsala , Sweden ) at room temperature .
A discontinuous Percoll density gradient was set up as follows : 70 % , 35 % , and 0 % isotonic Percoll .
This suspension was centrifuged for 30 minutes at 400 x g .
A mixed population of CNS macrophages and microglia was collected from the interphase between the 70 % and 35 % Percoll layers .
Cells were washed and then re - suspended in sterile HBSS .
The number of viable cells was determined using a hemacytometer and 0 . 2 % trypan blue staining .

Flow cytometric analysis of microglial cell surface markers was performed as described previously , but with a few modifications [ 48 ] .
In brief , Fc receptors on macrophages and microglia were blocked with anti - CD16 / CD32 antibody ( eBiosciences , CA ) .
Next , cells were incubated with either Panel - 1 ( anti - CD11b APC , anti - CD45 FITC , and anti - MHC II PE from eBiosciences , CA ) or Panel - 2 antibodies ( anti - CD11b APC , anti - CD45 FITC , and anti - TLR2 PE from eBiosciences , CA ) .
Expression of these surface receptors was determined by flow cytometry using a Becton - Dickinson FACSCaliber four color Cytometer .
Thirty thousand events were collected and microglia were differentiated from macrophages based on the levels of CD11b and CD45 surface expression .
Microglia stain CD11b + / CD45low and macrophages stain CD11b + / CD45high [ 48 , 49 ] .
Flow data were analyzed using FlowJo software ( Tree Star , San Carlos , CA ) .
Behavior tests
Social exploratory behavior
To assess the motivation to engage in social exploratory behavior , a novel juvenile conspecific was introduced into the test subject ' s home cage for a 10 - min period .
Behavior was video taped and the cumulative amount of time the subject engaged in social investigation was determined from the video records by a trained observer who was blind to the experimental treatments .
Baseline social behavior was measured at time 0 for all experimental treatments .
Social behavior was determined as the amount of time that the experimental subject spent investigating ( e . g . , anogenital sniffing , trailing ) the juvenile .
Results are expressed as percent decrease in time engaged in social behavior compared to respective baseline measures .
Sucrose preference
To assess sucrose preference , mice:__entity__ were provided two solutions , water or water supplemented with 2 % sucrose , in 50 ml conical tubes with stoppers fitted with ball - type sipper tubes .
Prior to testing conditions , all mice:__entity__ were acclimated to the two bottle test choice .
All mice:__entity__ drank both the water and the 2 % sucrose solution , but preferred drinking the sucrose over the water ( data not shown ) .
On the day of testing , mice:__entity__ were fluid and food deprived for 2 h prior to testing [ 50 ] .
At the start of the dark phase of the photoperiod , drinking water and the 2 % sucrose solution were placed in the home cage overnight ( 15 h ) .
At the end of each testing period the fluid content of the conical tubes was measured and sucrose preference was determined using the equation : Sucrose intake / Total fluid intake ( water + sucrose intake ) x 100 [ 51 ] .
Plasma cytokine measurement
IL - 6 and IL - 1 beta were measured in the plasma as previously described [ 52 ] .
In brief , mice:__entity__ were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation and blood was collected by cardiac puncture into EDTA coated syringes .
Samples were centrifuged ( 6000 x g for 15 min at 4 degrees C ) and plasma was collected and stored frozen ( - 80 degrees C ) until assaying .
Plasma samples were assayed for IL - 6 using a customized ELISA that we have described in detail [ 52 ] and for IL - 1 beta using a commercial ELISA kit ( R & D Systems , Minneapolis , MN ) .
Assays were sensitive to 8 pg / ml of IL - 6 and 1 . 5 pg / ml of IL - 1 beta , and inter - and intra - assay coefficients of variation were less than 10 % .
Real time PCR
Total RNA was isolated from brain using the Tri Reagent protocol ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) .
RNA samples were subjected to a DNase I digestion procedure and then reverse transcribed to cDNA using a RT RETROscript kit ( Ambion , Austin , TX ) .
Quantitative real time PCR was performed using the Applied Biosystems ( Foster , CA ) Assay - on Demand Gene Expression protocol as previously described [ 13 ] .
In brief , cDNA was amplified by real time PCR where a target cDNA ( IL - 1 beta , IL - 6 , MHC II , TLR2 , or IDO ) and a reference cDNA ( glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ) were amplified simultaneously using an oligonucleotide probe with a 5 ' fluorescent reporter dye ( 6 - FAM ) and a 3 ' quencher dye ( NFQ ) .
Fluorescence was determined on an ABI PRISM 7300 - sequence detection system ( Applied Biosystems , CA ) .
Data were analyzed using the comparative threshold cycle ( Ct ) method and results are expressed as fold difference .
Experimental protocols
For the cell culture studies , minocycline was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) and BV - 2 cells were washed and replenished with growth mediumsupplemented with 0 , 25 , 50 , 100 , 200 , or 400 mu g / ml minocycline .
After 30 min , LPS at 10 ng / ml was added to the culture medium .
Supernatants were collected 4 h later and IL - 6 and IL - 1 beta concentrations were determined by ELISA .
Total proteins were determined from cell culture homogenates by the Bio - Rad Dc protein assay according to the manufacturer ' s instructions ( Bio - Rad Lboratories , Hercules , CA ) .
Each treatment was replicated a minimum of four times .
Cell viability was confirmed by the MTS cell proliferation assay according to the manufacturer ' s instructions ( Promega , Madison , WI ) .
For all mouse:__entity__ studies , minocycline ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) was dissolved in sterile water and sonicated to ensure complete solubilization .
In the first mouse:__entity__ study , adult male BALB / c mice:__entity__ received an intraperitoneal ( i . p . ) injection of vehicle or minocycline ( 50 mg / kg ) for three consecutive days .
On the 3rd day , mice:__entity__ were also injected i . p . with saline or Escherichia:__entity__ coli:__entity__ LPS ( 0 . 33 mg / kg ; serotype 0127 : B8 , Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) and were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation 24 h later ( n = 6 ) .
The LPS dosage was selected because it elicits a proinflammatory cytokine response in the brain resulting in mild transient sickness behavior in adult mice:__entity__ [ 13 , 53 ] .
Macrophage / microglial cells were isolated from whole brain homogenates and TLR2 and MHC II surface expression were determined by flow cytometry .
The minocycline injection regimen and dosage was selected because a repeated pretreatment course with minocycline is necessary to attenuate neuroinflammation [ 41 - 43 , 45 ] .
In the second study , adult male BALB / c mice:__entity__ received an i . p . injection with vehicle or minocycline for three consecutive days .
On the third day , motivation to engage in social behavior was determined immediately before i . p . injection of saline or LPS ( 0 . 33 mg / kg ) and again 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , and 24 h later ( n = 8 ) .
Body weight and food intake were measured at each time point over the 24 h period .
In a related , but separate study , adult mice:__entity__ were treated with minocycline and LPS as described and anhedonia was assessed 24 - 39 h following i . p . injection of saline or LPS ( 0 . 33 mg / kg ) ( n = 15 ) .
Body weight , food intake , water intake , and sucrose intake were determined over the testing period .
In the third study , adult BALB / c mice:__entity__ were treated with minocycline and then LPS as described .
Mice:__entity__ were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation 4 later .
Brains were removed and dissected to collect different brain regions .
Brain regions were stored at - 20 degrees C in RNAlater ( Qiagen , CA ) .
Total RNA was isolated from brain samples and assayed using quantitative PCR ( n = 8 ) .
Plasma was also collected and stored ( - 80 degrees C ) until assaying .
In a final study , adult ( 3 - 4 month old ) or aged ( 20 - 22 month old ) male BALB / c mice:__entity__ were treated with minocycline and LPS as described and euthanized 4 h later .
Brains were dissected to collect different brain regions and were stored at - 20 degrees C in RNAlater ( Qiagen , CA ) .
Total RNA was isolated from the hippocampus and assayed using quantitative PCR ( n = 8 ) .
Statistical analysis
All data were analyzed using Statistical Analysis Systems ( SAS ) General Linear Model procedures .
Data were subjected to one , two - ( Mino x LPS , Age x LPS , Mino x Age ) or three - way ( Mino x LPS x Time , Mino x LPS x Age ) ANOVA to determine significant main effects and interactions between main factors .
When appropriate , differences between treatment means were evaluated by an F - protected t - test using the Least - Significant Difference procedure of SAS .
All data are expressed as treatment means +/- standard error of the mean ( SEM ) .
Results
Minocycline attenuates LPS - induced cytokine production in BV - 2 microglia
Minocycline is a tetracycline - type antibiotic that has anti - inflammatory properties in the CNS [ 41 - 43 , 45 ] .
To determine the degree to which minocycline suppresses microglia activation , BV - 2 microglia - derived cell lines were used .
In the first experiment , BV - 2 cells were treated with LPS and IL - 6 production was determined 4 h later .
Fig .
1A shows that LPS increased IL - 6 production in a dose dependent manner F ( 5 , 23 ) = 101 , P < 0 . 001 ) .
In the second experiment , BV - 2 cells were incubated with DMSO or minocycline and then stimulated with LPS .
Minocycline reduced LPS - induced IL - 6 secretion in a dose dependent manner ( Mino x LPS interaction , F ( 4 , 23 ) = 16 . 87 , P < 0 . 001 , Fig . 1B ) .
Minocycline pretreatment had a similar anti - inflammatory effect on LPS - stimulated IL - 1 beta secretion ( Fig . 1C ) .
In a third experiment , minocycline suppressed LPS - induced MHC II , TLR2 , IL - 1 beta , and IL - 6 mRNA levels ( P < 0 . 05 , for each , Fig . 1D ) .
The MTS assay verified that neither cell survival nor proliferation was affected by the experimental treatments ( data not shown ) .
LPS - induced TLR2 surface expression on microglia is reduced by minocycline
Because minocycline attenuated LPS - induced cytokine secretion and TLR2 mRNA expression in BV - 2 cells we next sought to determine if minocycline suppresses markers of microglial activation in the brain of mice:__entity__ .
Mice:__entity__ were injected i . p . with vehicle or minocycline for 3 consecutive days then challenged with saline or LPS i . p .
Markers of activation , TLR2 and MHC II , were determined on microglia collected 24 h later .
The representative bivariate density plot in Fig .
2A shows that there were two populations of CD11b / CD45 positive cells and that more cells stained CD11b + / CD45low ( microglia ) than CD11b + / CD45high ( CNS macrophages ) .
ANOVA revealed that LPS injection increased TLR2 surface expression on microglia ( F ( 1 , 20 ) = 17 . 6 , P < 0 . 004 , Fig . 2B & D ) , but this induction was abrogated by minocycline pretreatment ( Tendency for Mino x LPS interaction , F ( 1 , 20 ) = 2 . 66 , P = 0 . 10 , Fig . 2C & D ) .
It is important to note that because minocycline and saline controls did not differ in their TLR2 expression , these data were grouped together as the Control group ( Fig . 2B & C ) .
In addition , neither minocycline nor LPS treatment had a significant main effect on MHC class II surface expression on microglia ( data not shown ) .
These data indicate that minocycline attenuated LPS - induced TLR2 expression on microglia .
Minocycline facilitates the recovery from LPS - induced sickness behavior
CNS macrophages and microglia produce inflammatory cytokines and secondary messengers that modulate behavioral responses .
Therefore , we next investigated if minocycline reduced the sickness response associated with peripheral LPS injection .
In this experiment , adult mice:__entity__ were treated with minocycline and LPS as described .
Social exploratory behavior was measured before i . p .
LPS injection and again 2 , 4 , 8 , and 24 h later .
Fig .
3A shows that LPS injection caused a reduction in social exploratory behavior ( F ( 1 , 57 ) = 218 , P < 0 . 001 ) that was time dependent ( F ( 4 , 57 ) = 66 . 5 , P < 0 . 001 ) .
Moreover , the LPS - associated reduction in social exploration was attenuated by minocycline ( Mino x LPS interaction , F ( 1 , 57 ) = 7 . 5 , P < 0 . 007 ) .
For example , at 8 h post LPS , social exploration was reduced by 35 % in minocycline pretreated mice:__entity__ given LPS compared to a 67 % reduction in vehicle pretreated mice:__entity__ given LPS ( P < 0 . 001 ) .
While minocycline administration alone reduced food intake and body weight in control mice:__entity__ ( P < 0 . 05 , for each ) , it also protected against LPS - associated anorexia ( Mino x LPS interaction , F ( 1 , 60 ) = 70 . 0 , P < 0 . 001 , Fig . 3B ) and weight loss ( Mino x LPS interaction , F ( 1 , 60 ) = 29 . 7 , P < 0 . 001 , Fig . 3C ) .
Because sickness can also be associated with longer lasting changes in motivation [ 38 ] , we next sought to determine if minocycline abrogated LPS - induced anhedonia [ 54 , 55 ] .
In this experiment , mice:__entity__ were subjected to the same minocycline injection regimen and LPS challenge as above and sucrose preference was assessed 24 - 39 h post LPS injection .
By 24 h post LPS injection , food and water intake returned to baseline and LPS treated mice:__entity__ still exhibited a marked reduction in sucrose preference from 24 - 39 h ( F ( 1 , 59 ) = 14 . 3 , P < 0 . 003 ) .
Moreover , this LPS - dependent reduction in sucrose preference was prevented by minocycline pretreatment ( Mino x LPS interaction , F ( 1 , 59 ) = 9 . 9 , P < 0 . 004 , Fig . 4 ) .
For example , minocycline pretreated mice:__entity__ injected with LPS maintained the same strong preference for sucrose as saline and minocycline controls ( i . e . , approximately 85 % preference ) .
These data can be interpreted to indicate that minocycline blocks anhedonia associated with peripheral LPS challenge .
Minocycline reduces LPS - induced neuroinflammation
Pro - inflammatory cytokines in the CNS are partially responsible for the behavioral symptoms of sickness ( e . g . , anorexia , social withdrawal , and anhedonia ) [ 1 ] .
Therefore , we investigated the degree to which minocycline reduces neuroinflammation ( IL - 1 beta , IL - 6 , and IDO ) after peripheral injection of LPS .
In this experiment , mice:__entity__ were subjected to the minocycline injection regimen and LPS challenge as above and cytokine mRNA levels were determined in the cortex and hippocampus 4 h after LPS injection .
In mice:__entity__ pretreated with vehicle , LPS markedly increased IL - 1 beta mRNA levels in the hippocampus ( F ( 1 , 31 ) = 62 , P < 0 . 0001 ) and cortex ( F ( 1 , 31 ) = 17 . 25 , P < 0 . 0003 ) .
The LPS - induced IL - 1 beta mRNA expression was reduced in both brain regions in mice:__entity__ receiving minocycline prior to LPS injection : ( hippocampus , F ( 1 , 31 ) = 9 . 63 , P < 0 . 01 ) and cortex , F ( 1 , 31 ) = 7 . 23 , P = 0 . 08 , Fig .
5A ) .
LPS caused a similar induction of IL - 6 mRNA levels in the hippocampus ( F ( 1 , 31 ) = 37 . 2 , P < 0 . 001 ) and cortex ( F ( 1 , 31 ) = 22 . 5 , P < 0 . 001 ) , but minocycline pretreatment only significantly attenuated LPS - induced IL - 6 mRNA levels in the hippocampus ( F ( 1 , 31 ) = 10 . 27 , P < 0 . 004 , Fig . 5B ) .
IDO mRNA levels were determined from the same RNA pool .
Fig .
6D shows that LPS injection increased IDO mRNA expression in the hippocampus ( F ( 1 , 31 ) = 11 . 69 , P < 0 . 002 ) and cortex ( F ( 1 , 31 ) = 5 . 26 , P < 0 . 03 ) .
This LPS - induced IDO mRNA expression was attenuated by minocycline in the hippocampus ( F ( 1 , 31 ) = 11 . 69 , P < 0 . 002 ) and cortex ( F ( 1 , 31 ) = 5 . 26 , P < 0 . 03 ) .
It is important to note that IDO mRNA was undetected in saline treated mice:__entity__ .
Therefore , the fold IDO change was relative to the IDO mRNA levels in mice:__entity__ receiving minocycline prior to LPS .
Minocycline reduces LPS - induced IL - 6 , but not IL - 1 beta , in the plasma
Because cytokine signals can be relayed from the periphery to the brain by humoral pathways [ 56 ] , plasma cytokine levels of IL - 6 and IL - 1 beta were determined 4 h post LPS injection .
As expected , LPS injection caused a marked increase in plasma IL - 1 beta ( F ( 1 , 36 ) = 52 . 5 , P < 0 . 001 ) and IL - 6 levels ( F ( 1 , 36 ) 34 . 01 , P < 0 . 01 ) .
Minocycline pretreatment reduced LPS - induced IL - 6 levels in the plasma ( F ( 1 , 36 ) 6 . 68 , P < 0 . 01 ) but had no significant main effect on LPS - induced IL - 1 beta levels ( Fig . 6 ) .
Minocycline attenuates LPS - induced exaggerated neuroinflammation in aged mice:__entity__
Aged BALB / c mice:__entity__ ( 22 - 24 m ) have an exaggerated neuroinflammatory response to LPS injection [ 10 , 13 , 14 ] .
Therefore , we next sought to determine if the heightened inflammatory response in the brain of aged mice:__entity__ was reduced by minocycline .
In this experiment , adult and aged mice:__entity__ were subjected to the minocycline injection regimen and LPS challenge as above .
As we have reported previously , MHC II mRNA expression was increased by age ( P < 0 . 03 , Fig . 7A ) [ 13 , 14 ] , but MHC II levels were unaffected by either LPS or minocycline treatment ( not shown ) .
Consistent with the data presented in Fig .
2 , ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of LPS injection on TLR2 mRNA expression in the hippocampus ( F ( 1 , 63 ) = 85 . 5 , P < 0 . 001 ) .
Moreover , LPS caused a greater increase in TLR2 mRNA in the hippocampus of aged mice:__entity__ compared to adults ( LPS x Age interaction , F ( 1 , 63 ) = 12 . 70 , P < 0 . 01 ) .
Furthermore , minocycline pretreatment attenuated LPS - induced TLR2 mRNA levels in both adult and aged mice:__entity__ ( Mino x LPS interaction , F ( 1 , 63 ) = 9 . 02 , P < 0 . 004 ) .
Parallel to the results for TLR2 , LPS caused a greater increase in IL - 1 beta and IDO mRNA levels in hippocampus of aged mice:__entity__ compared to adults ( Age x LPS , F ( 1 , 60 ) = 8 . 64 , P < 0 . 01 for IL - 1 beta and F ( 1 , 60 ) = 4 . 0 , P < 0 . 05 for IDO ) .
Minocycline pretreatment attenuated LPS - induced mRNA levels of IL - 1 beta ( Mino x LPS , F ( 1 , 60 ) = 8 . 76 , P < 0 . 01 , Fig . 7C ) and IDO ( Mino x LPS , F ( 1 , 60 ) = 9 . 7 , P < 0 . 003 , Fig . 7D ) .
While LPS induced higher IL - 6 mRNA levels in the hippocampus of both adult and aged mice:__entity__ ( F ( 1 , 59 ) = 44 . 5 , P < 0 . 001 ) , there was not an Age x LPS interaction .
Minocycline pretreatment attenuated the LPS - induced increase in hippocampal IL - 6 mRNA ( Mino x LPS , F ( 1 , 59 ) = 5 . 4 , P < 0 . 02 , Fig . 7E ) .
Taken together these data indicate that minocycline pretreatment was effective in attenuating the exaggerated neuroinflammation in aged mice:__entity__ .
Discussion
In the elderly , systemic infection is associated with an increased frequency of behavioral and cognitive complications [ 57 , 58 ] .
We have reported that stimulation of the peripheral immune system in older ( 20 - 24 m ) BALB / c mice:__entity__ causes exaggerated neuroinflammation that is paralleled by prolonged sickness [ 13 ] , impaired working memory [ 10 ] , and depressive - like behaviors [ 15 ] .
Therefore , it is important to understand the mechanisms that can modulate cytokine - mediated pathways in the brain .
Here we show that minocycline treatment reduced LPS - induced TLR2 expression in BV - 2 cells and on microglia isolated from adult mice:__entity__ .
Moreover , we demonstrate that minocycline was effective in facilitating the recovery from LPS - induced sickness and preventing anhedonia in adult mice:__entity__ .
Furthermore , we show that minocycline attenuated LPS - induced neuroinflammation in adults and normalized the exaggerated neuroinflammation in aged mice:__entity__ .
Our findings , using cell culture and animal experiments , support the notion that minocycline attenuates microglial activation and limits production of inflammatory mediators .
For instance , minocycline pretreatment of BV - 2 cultures decreased LPS - stimulated cytokine production in a dose dependent manner ( Fig . 1A ) .
In BV - 2 cells , minocycline also attenuated mRNA expression of inflammatory genes including IL - 6 , IL - 1 beta , MHC II , and TLR2 ( Fig . 1D ) .
These data are consistent with other studies using minocycline and LPS in BV - 2 cells [ 44 , 59 ] .
Based on these data we next investigated if microglial activation could be attenuated in the brain .
Because LPS increases brain cytokine production we expected that MHC II expression would also be increased .
Contrary to our predictions , neither MHC II mRNA levels ( Fig . 7 ) in the brain nor MHC II surface expression on microglia ( CD11b + / CD45low ) ( data not shown ) were increased by LPS injection .
In an EAE model , minocycline reduced microglial expression of MHC II [ 45 ] , but one key difference from our study is that the induction of EAE pathology requires functional antigen presentation on MHC II [ 60 ] .
It is postulated that microglia have several activation states that depend on the specific inflammatory stimulus [ 61 ] .
Thus , in situations of transient peripheral innate immune stimulation , markers in the CNS such as Toll - Like receptors [ 6 ] may be indicative of microglia activation .
In support of this premise , our data show that LPS injection increases TLR2 surface expression on microglia ( CD11b + / CD45low ) , which is inhibited by minocycline pretreatment ( Fig . 2 ) .
These data are consistent with other studies showing that central or peripheral LPS challenge increases TLR2 mRNA in the brain [ 6 , 14 ] .
Taken together our findings can be interpreted to suggest that minocycline attenuates pathways associated with microglia activation following peripheral LPS challenge .
One of the important findings of this study was that reduction of neuroinflammation by minocycline was associated with facilitated recovery from LPS - induced sickness behavior .
These results are akin to our previous work with the anti - oxidant , alpha - tocopherol [ 52 ] , and an NFKB decoy inhibitor [ 62 ] .
Consistent with our previous studies [ 52 , 53 , 62 , 63 ] , reductions in neuroinflammatory cytokines ( Fig . 5 ) did not prevent the induction of the LPS - induced sickness response ( 2 - 4 h ) , but rather facilitated the recovery from sickness ( 8 - 24 h ) ( Fig . 3A ) .
Recovery may be a critical issue because brain cytokines and the corresponding physiological and behavioral responses are beneficial to the host [ 1 ] .
The potential risk for a maladaptive response occurs when the normally transient neuroinflammatory response is amplified or protracted [ 64 ] .
Therefore pharmacological agents , similar to minocycline , that attenuate neuroinflammatory responses , but do not completely inhibit them , may be important in preventing the development of more severe and long - lasting cognitive and behavioral complications .
The results of the sucrose preference experiments support the idea that limiting exposure to neuroinflammation decreases the duration of behavioral responses .
For example , while minocycline did not inhibit cytokine expression ( Fig . 5 ) or the induction of sickness ( Fig . 3A ) , minocycline pretreatment completely reversed the reduction in sucrose preference ( i . e . , anhedonia ) associated with LPS injection ( Fig . 4 ) .
It is also important to mention that while LPS - associated sickness and anhedonia are interrelated , these behaviors can be differentiated from one another .
For instance , reduced social exploration was evident 2 - 24 h post injection ( Fig . 3A ) , but only decreased sucrose preference was exhibited 24 to 39 h later ( Fig . 4 ) .
This separation between behaviors is consistent with other studies investigating sickness and longer - lasting changes in motivation [ 15 , 65 , 66 ] .
IDO mediated TRP metabolism represents a potential connection between activation of CNS innate immune cells and longer lasting behavioral responses .
IDO mediated TRP metabolism in the brain may affect behavior by impacting both serotonin and glutamate pathways [ 39 ] .
We have reported that IDO induction and activity is amplified in the brain of aged mice:__entity__ and is associated with prolonged depressive - like behavior [ 15 ] .
Here we show that IDO mRNA induction is blocked by minocycline in the brain of both adult and aged mice:__entity__ ( Figs . 5 & 7 ) .
These data are consistent with a recent report showing a causal relationship between IDO activity and acute depressive effects in adult CD - 1 mice:__entity__ .
In this study , O ' Connor et al . report that both 1 - methyl tryptophan ( a competitive inhibitor of IDO ) and minocycline blocked IDO induction and prevented depressive - like immobility in the tail suspension and forced swimming tests [ 66 ] .
Thus , in the present study , the minocycline blockade of IDO induction may explain the abrogation of LPS - induced anhedonia .
Another interesting finding was that while minocycline pretreatment in adult mice:__entity__ attenuated LPS - induced brain IL - 1 beta at 4 h ( Fig . 5 ) , it had no effect on plasma IL - 1 beta levels ( Fig . 6 ) .
Because IL - 1 beta signals can be relayed from the periphery to the brain by humoral pathways [ 5 ] , these findings suggest that minocycline has anti - inflammatory properties within the brain .
These data are consistent with related findings that minocycline readily crosses the blood brain barrier to elicit an anti - inflammatory effect [ 41 - 43 ] .
With regard to IL - 6 , minocycline pretreatment attenuated both brain and plasma levels at 4 h post LPS injection .
Because circulating IL - 6 levels can be increased by CNS mediated pathways including activation of the hypothalamus - pituitary - adrenal ( HPA ) axis [ 67 ] and the sympathetic nervous system [ 68 ] , the specific reduction in plasma IL - 6 by minocycline may reflect the reduction in brain inflammation at 4 h ( Fig . 5 ) .
In support of this notion , we and others have reported that i . c . v . injection of LPS or IL - 1 beta increase plasma IL - 6 levels , but not IL - 1 beta levels [ 14 , 68 , 69 ] .
The final critical finding of this study was that minocycline was effective in attenuating neuroinflammation independent of age .
Consistent with other aging and neuroinflammation studies , our data show that LPS caused exaggerated neuroinflammation in aged mice:__entity__ compared to adults [ 10 , 13 - 15 ] .
It is important to mention that while there was an age - related difference in MHC II expression in the hippocampus of saline treated mice:__entity__ ( Fig . 7A ) there was not an age - related difference in IL - 1 beta and IL - 6 mRNA levels .
These data differ from a previous report using BALB / c mice:__entity__ showing an increase in IL - 6 in older mice:__entity__ [ 70 ] .
This may be because the mice:__entity__ used in the present study were approximately 4 months younger than the mice:__entity__ used previously .
Nonetheless , microglia can be primed or reactive with increased MHC II expression , but do not necessarily produce inflammatory cytokines in this state [ 19 ] .
The key results are that peripheral LPS injection causes a greater induction of TLR2 , IL - 1 beta , and IDO mRNA in the aged brain than in the adult brain and that minocycline pretreatment normalizes this age - related exaggerated neuroinflammation ( Fig . 7 ) .
These findings are also important because an amplified neuroinflammatory response in the aged brain is a precursor to complications including deficits in working memory , memory consolidation , and depressive - like behavior [ 9 , 10 , 15 ] .
Based on the biochemical and behavioral data obtained from this study , we predict that minocycline will abrogate the prolonged LPS - induced sickness [ 13 ] and depressive - like behavior exhibited by aged BALB / c mice:__entity__ [ 15 ] .
We acknowledge , however , that future studies are necessary to test these predictions .
Conclusion
The present study demonstrates that minocycline reduces LPS - induced microglial activation , CNS cytokine production , and behavioral symptoms of sickness ( e . g . , social withdrawal and anhedonia ) .
These findings are potentially important because they indicate that minocycline can be used to mitigate cytokine expression in the brain and have a beneficial affect on behavioral responses .
Taken together , these data support the idea that pharmacological strategies aimed at decreasing neuroinflammation associated with microglial activation are important for improving recovery from sickness and reducing the frequency of neurobehavioral complications .

A case of demand ischemia from phendimetrazine
Abstract
Introduction
Phendimetrazine is a medication currently being used to help patients:__entity__ with weight loss .
It shares a chemical structure with amphetamines .
As such , it shares some of the same toxicities , which can include cardiac toxicity .
This case highlights this principle .
Case presentation
a 54 year old Caucasian female presented to our urgent care facility with complaints of chest pains and other symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome .
Ultimately , she was transferred to the emergency room .
After evaluation there , it appeared she was having demand ischemia from prescription diet pills
Conclusion
This case report demonstrates the potential dangers of amphetamine based diet pills .
There have been other cases of cardiomyopathies related to phendimetrazine , but it is something that is rarely recognized in an outpatient setting .
A case such as this demonstrates the importance of obtaining a careful medication history in all patients:__entity__ and in recognizing diet pills with an amphetamine base can cause cardiac toxicity .

A 54 year - old Caucasian female presented to our urgent care facility complaining of nausea and vomiting , sense of impending doom and vague chest pain radiating toward her left side for about five hours .
She never had similar symptoms in the past .
She also denied anything that could have precipitated these symptoms .
Her only past medical history was significant for spina bifida .
Her medications included occasional Fiorinal ( unknown dose ) , Xanax 0 . 5 mg as needed , and Phendimetrazine ( unclear dose ) .
Her social history was significant for smoking 1 / 2 pack per day cigarette use .
She denied alcohol use .
Family history was non contributory .
She worked from home .
Her physical exam showed a tachycardia of around 100 beats per minute , respiratory rate of 16 , temperature of 98 . 1 , and O2 saturation of 100 % on room air .
She was approximately 5 ' 7 " and 145 pounds .
In general , she was an anxious appearing , diaphoretic woman:__entity__ in moderate distress , she had no elevated JVD at 30 degrees , her heart was tachycardic , but otherwise without murmur , gallops , or rubs , her lungs were clear , abdomen soft , and she had no peripheral edema .
An EKG was checked which appears below ( figure 1 ) .
After examination , there was concern for acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) .
She was given nitroglycerin with relief of her chest discomfort .
She was also given aspirin to chew .
EMS was called and she was transferred to a local emergency room .
She was hospitalized there for three days and after her discharge , we got permission from her to request records .
While hospitalized , she was ruled out for ACS with negative troponins .
She was also given beta blockade which resolved her tachycardia and her T wave changes on EKG .
The next morning , she had an adenosine stress test which revealed normal uptake with no areas of ischemia and an ejection fraction of 55 % .
She was monitored for one more day and then discharged with instructions to discontinue her diet pills .
Discussion
Phendimetrazine is a medication currently being used for weight loss , with potential for illicit use .
It has a similar chemical composition of amphetamines , which is thought to account for its clinical actions [ 1 ] .
Amphetamines are well recognized as an etiology of cardiac ischemia , however phendimetrazine is more rarely described in the literature as causing cardiac events .
[ 2 , 3 ] .
Acute effects include hyperpyrexia , mydriasis , chest pain , arrhytmias , delirium , and , rhabdomylosis , among others [ 2 ] .
Long term use has been associated with dilated cardiomyopathies , some of which have resolved with discontinuation of the medication [ 3 ] .
In this particular case , it appears she may have developed a demand ischemia from the medication .
It is not known how much of the drug she was taking .
Initially , she was resistant to accepting that phendimetrazine could induce side effects , and there was suspicion that she could have been taking more of the drug that recommended .
In addition , she was not prescribed the medication and would not admit to where she obtained it .
As the public seems to have more focus on using medications to induce weight loss , this may be a more recognized complication and heart conditions should likely be monitored prior to starting amphetamine based weight loss pills .
Conclusion
Due to potentially detrimental effects of this medication , phendimetrazine should be used cautiously in many situations .
As it shares its chemical structure with amphetamines , it also shares many of the side effects and the potential for abuse / addiction .
There have been other reports in literature describing adverse outcomes from phendimetrazine as well as other weight loss medications .
Therefore , cautious use is warranted .

Introduction While a proliferation of commercial chemical instrumentation is appearing today employing microprocessors for a variety of control and data reduction applications , the great potential of microprocessors has not been exploited extensively for individual custom applications .
The primary reason for this phenomenon is altogether too clear microprocessor software is either difficult to develop or inefficient in memory requirements and speed .
This problem is even more important in situations requiring constant software
modification .
Initially , most instrument manufacturers utilized cross assemblers supported on large " number cruncher " computers to generate the required machine code binary program .
More recently , the trend has been toward the use of a " developmental system " ( at a cost comparable to a moderate minicomputer - the authors use the term " mini " in contrast to " micro " reluctantly because of the ever increasing overlap in computing capability ) to write and debug assembly level porgrams which are subsequently converted to binary and incorporated into an instrument in the form of " read only memory " ( ROM ) .

has proven cost effective for high volume mass produced applications , it possesses serious limitations for system updates and custom applications .
Additionally , the ability to program efficiently at the assembly level is a talent requiring a significant expenditure of time to develop .
During the past several years , a virtual deluge of sophisticated , flexible , high performance computer hardware has been introduced primarily aimed at a rapidly growing " hobbyist " market .
Manufacturers quickly realilsed that to sell the public hardware , some form of reasonably high level software must be made available .
A variety of BASIC interpreters , ranging from rather " dumb " to " quite intelligent " have since evolved .
The more intelligent BASIC interpreters have several highly attractive attributes for " hobbyist " applications .
The language is both easy to master and conversational .
Error and caution messages are provided as aids during programming .
Why not apply the " hobbyist " technology toward the implementation of custom laboratory systems ?
Many investigators have and , no doubt , many more will take this approach .
However , BASIC interpreters possess serious limitations in terms of system speed , flexibility and input / output ( I / O ) capabilities .
In BASIC , each command must first be interpreted and then executed ( see Figure 1 ) .
In many cases , the interpretation process takes much more time than the actual execution .
This problem is compounded by the fact that commands interpreted in the past must be re - interpreted each time they are used causing iterative programs to be very slow .
While speed is often not a serious limitation in playing computer games , laboratory application requiring high speed data acquisition and / or data manipulation are common .
Additionally , the more intelligent BASICs make very inefficient use of memory often requiring minimum of 12 or 16 K bytes ( twelve or sixteen thousand eight bit words ) ' Volume

The stack which is composed of data parameters etc . acts as a constantly expanding or contracting memory buffer which allows one subroutine to communicate with another without either needing to know the other ' s location .
In contrast to interpreters , high level compilers , such as FORTRAN , offer a much faster " run time " execution speed .
This is accomplished through generation of the required machine code during a series of programming operations .
Compilers using FORTRAN , which are designed to run on many minicomputers and some micros , often first transform user symbolic source code into assembly code .
An assembler program , subsequently , transforms this into the required machine code .
This ready - to - run machine code is often loaded along with a run time package which executes in the manner shown in Figure 2 .
While this approach greatly improves execution speed , the need for loading several different soft - ware routines increases the " hassle " associated with editing and debugging .
Thus , this makes some form of mass memory , such as a disk or magnetic tape , almost mandatory .
Additionally , I / O algorithms generally must be implemented in assembly level code !
One obvious question immediately arises - why not incorporate the most desirable characteristics of both interpreters and compilers into a single language ?
Additionally , due to the unique requirements found in many applications , why not allow the programmer additional flexibility by providing him with the ability to actually develop his own individual modifications and additions to the language itself ?
Other desirable features would include high memory efficiency , high level I ] O programming , ease of understanding the language ' s " inter - working " and the ability to be transferred from one CPU to another with minimum effort .

Ten lines of typical CONVERS code to scan wavelengths between two easily changed limits and acquire data .
By reference to notes in the text it can be easily understood .
NOTE : a number or name pushes the number of address occupied by the name on the stack .
The symbol @ , pips the top number from the stack uses it as the address from which to obtain a number and pushes that number on the stack .
Development of CONVERS During the past two years , a different approach to software has been taking place at the University of Arizona referred to as an " Interpretive Compiler " called CONVERS .
This package , which is conceptually similar to the FORTH language currently being used in several minicomputerastronomical applications ] , is able to provide many of the desirable features found in both interpreters and compilers by separating the compile and execute states ( as a compiler does ) while maintaining a resident user interactive and conversational executive which oversees system operation .
The ability to realise such advanced software capabilities in a very modest amount of memory ( less than 4 K bytes on an 8080 based micro ) is the direct result of exploiting threaded code programming techniques ( see Figure 3 ) .
The approach involves highly efficient use of simple macroinstructions to build more complex subroutines which are recombined with additional macroinstructions to form super subroutines .
This process of combining previously defined modules to form ever increasingly sophisticated routines for performing the task at hand is the essence of threaded code programming .
When initially loaded and running , CONVERS acts much like an interpreter , i . e . it is conversational , ready to either execute a previously programmed algorithm or accept a new one .
However , in contrast to BASIC , when a new program is being entered under CONVERS , it is immediately transformed into binary machine code or to the binary starting addresses of other previously entered and compiled machine code programs .
During this process , the operator is kept informed of the status of the program by a series of error and diagnostic Volume
messages .
When the new program has been completed , it is entered in a program library or dictionary , which is constantly building up from low memory ( see Figure 4 ) .
If the operator now wants to execute this program , he can request it from his terminal .
A dictionary search will begin at the last entry and progress until the requested program is located .
Once located , the requested program will run in its entirety without need for any additional dictionary searches .
For example , let us assume an algorithm , called ACQUIRE , has been programmed to take data from some hypothetical experimental system .
When ACQUIRE is requested from the terminal , a dictionary search is initiated .
The program names ACQUIRE ( see Figure 5 ) , once located , contains the starting addresses of a series of previously defined modules which implement the various steps necessary to perform the desired experiment .
For example , the module SCAN which might be intended to scan a monochromator ' s wavelength in some desired manner has been previously defined and tested .
This ability to easily test each module separately and then efficiently combine a series of modules to perform a more complex function , test this function , and then employ . it in a vastly more complex function , etc . , i . e . testing each step as the threaded code is made increasingly complex , is a major factor contributing to the speed with which software can be developed using CONVERS .
Use of a software stack also contributes toward improved memory efficiency and simplified programming .
The stack is an area of memory set aside to handle parameters , data numbers , etc .
One of the primary advantages of the stack is that entries can leave temporary parameters on the stack without having to assign specific 131

memory locations to store them .
This not only can save considerable memory , but also allows programs to be easily relocatable since one algorithm need only know that a previous routine left so many words of data , etc . on the stack .
It need not know where the previous routine is nor even where the stack is located .
A series of stack handling routines , which should appear quite familiar to many small calculator users , provide an array of capabilities , including the ability to PUSH a number on the stack , POP , it off , duplicate it , SWAP the top two numbers , locate a number some distance into the stack , and copy it on top of the stack , etc .
Additionally , a variety of logic functions familiar to the minicomputer user are provided including OR , AND , shift left , shift right , greater than , less than , etc .
Input / output ( I / O ) is normally accomplished using the stack in conjunction with the INDEVICE or OUTDEVICE commands .
For example , to take data from a device located at I / O , port 7 , the number seven is " pushed " onto the stack ( 7 ) , goes to this I / O port , takes in a number and " pushes " the number on the stack .
OUTDEVICE functions in a similar manner , requiring the number to be sent to the desired device to be " pushed " onto the stack followed by the device ' s I / O port address .
Hence , to send the number 131 to device 11 , the number 131 is pushed on the stack followed by 11 and then OUTDEVICE .
This " pops " the top number ( 11 ) from the stack , uses it as the output port and then sends the number 131 to that location .

The colon denotes changing from EXECUTE to COMPILE mode .
After typing the name of the new routine , in this case to be called SOUND , typing the name of the earlier defined routine ( BELL a previously defined simple program to rng the terminal bell ) initiates a dictionary search to locate this routine ' s starting address which subsequentially is entered three times .
The resulting SOUND routine contains machine code calls to the BE LL routine which , itself , is composed of machine code .
Of course , SOUND could also have been defined using a DO - LOOP , i . e . SOUND 3
DO
BELL
LOOP
where the numbers three and one set the upper and lower indices .
If it were desirable to change the actual number of bell rings from some other program , this value could be defined as a VARIABLE let ' s call it NOISE .
3
VARIABLE NOISE
In this case , the number three is first pushed on the stack , VARIABLE transfers the top number on the stack ( the three ) to a dictionary location named NOISE .
If SOUND were now defined as : SOUND
NOISE
@
DO
BELL
LOOP
Applications of CONVERS To appreciate the ease with which real programs can be written , a few examples will be considered .
A trivial program , called SOUND , which rings the terminal bell three times , might be written : 132
the bell would again ring three times .
In this case , when the word NOISE iS encountered , its address is pushed on the stack , the @ is a simple program which goes to the address indicated on the top of the stack ( that of NOISE ) and replaces it with the actual value located at that address ( the number three ) .
At any future time , the value of VARIABLE can be changed by " pushing " the new value onto the stack , followed by the address of the variable to be changed , generated by its name and an exclamation mark .

5 NOISE a number five is pushed onto the stack , NOISE pushes its address on the stack , and goes to the address indicated by the " top " number on the stack and deposits the next number .
Now sound would ring the terminal bell five times .
A much less trivial program which could be written to scan and take data from a monochromator equipped with a
DENCO SM2A stepper motor controller [ 2 ] ( the SM2A takes a parallel number as an address , sends one of two stepper motors to this location and outputs an arrival flag when the address is reached ) is given in Figure 6 .
Assume that the experimental system is configured so the SM2A is at I / O , port 5 and an analog to digital converter to acquire data is at I / O , port 7 .
Let us assume that , initially , a scan is designed from a starting stepper motor location of 2000 to a final location of 5000 , taking data every 20 steps .
The program illustrated in figure 6 acts in the following manner .
Line defines a variable called START to be 2000 , which is the starting location of fhe scan .
The end of the scan is defined as 5000 in the next line .
Line 3 defines the increment between data points .
A variable called LOCATION where the . next address is stored is defined in line 4 . .
Colon , in line 5 , puts the system in the compile mode , A / D7 will be the name of the module which when called will cause a 7 to be pushed onto the stack .
INDEVICE will ' pop ' it back off and use it as a device address to go and take a data point and push the data onto the stack .
Line 6 defines a module INITIALIZE , START puts its address on the stack , @ replaces the address with the value at that address , LOCATION puts its address on the stack , ' ! ' goes to the address specified by the number on the stack and deposits the second number and the net result value at START is put into LOCATION .
Line 7 defines STEP to take values from
LOCATION and INCREMENT adds them together and puts the result into LOCATION , i . e . LOCATION puts its address on the stack , @ replaces the top value on the stack with the number stored at the address , INCREMENT @ gets the value at INCREMENT and puts it in to the stack , and adds the top two stack numbers and pushes the result on the stack .
LOCATION puts its address on the stack and goes to the address specified by the top number on the stack and deposits the second number .
Themodule defined in line 8 takes a number from the stepper motor controller ( assume device numbered 5 ) pushes on the stack , and pushes the value 10 on the stack and does a logical AND to see if the controllers flag is set , if this is true the A / D7 module will be called to input data , if the flag is not set , the program is returned to BEGIN - HERE .
Therefore the DELAY module is a loop waiting for the stepper motor to arrive at its new location followed by a call to A / D7 data acquisition module .
MOVE defined in line 9 gets the value stored at LOCATION pushes the device code onto the stack performs an outdevice ( which uses the top stack number as a 1 / 0 port address to send the next value to call the STEP module ( ie the value at LOCATION ) , this increments LOCATION by the INCREM E N T value and finally calls D E L A Y and waits for a flag from the stepper motor controller to signal its arrival at the desired address and then takes a data point .
The final line shown in the example Called SCAN itself calls the INITIALIZE module ( which sets LOCATION to the START location for the Scan ) it also calls MOVE ( which sends this value to the motor LOCATION controller , increments the value stored in LOCATION by INCREMENT and calls DELAY which waits for the motor to arrive and then takes a data point ) .
Next the incremented value from LOCATION is placed on the stack ( LOCATION ) followed by the STOP

It should be noted that whilst many variables have been pushed on the stack , only the data will remain , since each time a value is used it is ' popped ' ( removed ) from the stack .

While the code might look a little strange at first , it quickly becomes very easy to work with .

Each module of the program can be easily tried out to ensure that it is operational before proceeding with the next .

Introduction Microprocessors are being used to add inexpensive automatic control and data handling facilities to a variety of chemical instruments .
With a microcomputer it is now possible to realise the flexibility formerly available only with a relatively large and expensive minicomputer in an instrument little different in size and cost from one controlled by inflexible hardware .
In many ways chromatography is an ideal process for such automation .
Most instruments are given a high workload and , although many applications may be routine and repetitive , the versatility of the technique requires an instrument which can easily be used in a variety of modes .
In addition to improving the convenience to the user , automation of a liquid chromatrograph should enhance the performance of the instrument .
Some aspects of high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) which can benefit in this way are as follows : ( 1 ) Accurate control of solvent flow rate will compensate for changes in pressure drop and lead to more reliable retention times .
( 2 ) The composition of the mobile phase can be accurately controlled in either isocratic or gradient elution chromatography using , for example , a proportioning valve on the low pressure side of the pump .
( 3 ) Automatic sampling can be operated in a variety of modes to process a number of samples without supervision .
It is also more precise than manual injection .
( 4 ) A built - in data handling facility can present the analyst with an easily read post - run report of the analytical results with accurate peak area measurements even for peaks which are poorly resolved .
Although liquid chromatographs incorporating microprocessors for control and data handling purposes are commercially available , these instruments are , so far , This paper describes , in detail , the relatively inflexible . automation of a liquid chromatograph using an inexpensive general purpose microcomputer , which has previously been applied in atomic absorption spectrophotometry [ 1 ] and for column switching in HPLC 2 ] .
Figure illustrates the interconnection of the chromatograph and the microcomputer which controls the mobile phase flow rate , operates an automatic sampler and analyses data from the detector .
The control and data handling functions are integrated in a program which enables the user to communicate with the instrument , in plain English , via a visual display unit ( VDU ) or teletypewriter keyboard .
A variety of operational modes is offered , giving the analyst an opportunity to establish the best conditions for a particular separation before leaving the instrument to perform its given tasks without further interaction .

TOPS + + FATCAT : Fast flexible structural alignment using constraints derived from TOPS + Strings Model
Abstract
Background
Protein structure analysis and comparison are major challenges in structural bioinformatics .
Despite the existence of many tools and algorithms , very few of them have managed to capture the intuitive understanding of protein structures developed in structural biology , especially in the context of rapid database searches .
Such intuitions could help speed up similarity searches and make it easier to understand the results of such analyses .
Results
We developed a TOPS + + FATCAT algorithm that uses an intuitive description of the proteins ' structures as captured in the popular TOPS diagrams to limit the search space of the aligned fragment pairs ( AFPs ) in the flexible alignment of protein structures performed by the FATCAT algorithm .
The TOPS + + FATCAT algorithm is faster than FATCAT by more than an order of magnitude with a minimal cost in classification and alignment accuracy .
For beta - rich proteins its accuracy is better than FATCAT , because the TOPS + strings models contains important information of the parallel and anti - parallel hydrogen - bond patterns between the beta - strand SSEs ( Secondary Structural Elements ) .
We show that the TOPS + + FATCAT errors , rare as they are , can be clearly linked to oversimplifications of the TOPS diagrams and can be corrected by the development of more precise secondary structure element definitions .
Software Availability
The benchmark analysis results and the compressed archive of the TOPS + + FATCAT program for Linux platform can be downloaded from the following web site :
Conclusion
TOPS + + FATCAT provides FATCAT accuracy and insights into protein structural changes at a speed comparable to sequence alignments , opening up a possibility of interactive protein structure similarity searches .
Background
Structural biology is one of the most successful fields of modern biology .
Over 50 , 000 solved protein structures illustrate details of many specific biological processes .
The same data also provide us with information about the global features of protein structure space and can be studied to discover the evolutionary , physical , and mathematical rules governing them .
How many fundamentally different protein shapes ( folds ) are there ?
How do protein structures evolve ?
How do new structural features appear , and if they are coupled with changes in function , how does this process occur ?
Such questions can be studied by classifying , comparing and analyzing known protein structures .
Two different , but synergistic strategies are typically used for this purpose .
In classification systems such as SCOP [ 1 ] or CATH [ 2 ] , human:__entity__ intuition is used to simplify the description of protein structures to a manageable size , and a human:__entity__ eye , sometimes supported by automated analysis , can recognize patterns and types of structures .
In the second approach , specialized comparison algorithms , such as DALI [ 3 ] , CE [ 4 ] , or FATCAT [ 5 ] can be used to calculate a distance - like metric in the protein structure space .
This in turn can be used to cluster proteins into groups .
Many such algorithms have been developed over the past few decades and have been mostly used for the classification of protein structures into families .
An exact solution of an alignment between two structures is formally equivalent to a threading problem and is therefore NP - complete [ 6 ] .
However , a practical solution can be obtained by heuristics reducing the problem to a manageable size [ 7 ] .
In human:__entity__ classification systems , the protein is usually reduced to a set of several structural elements , which obviously involve many arbitrary thresholds .
Automated algorithms have the same problem and also suffer from inconsistencies between different numerical measures of protein structure similarity [ 8 ] .
Interestingly , despite these problems , results of different approaches are broadly similar .
They all identify approximately a few hundred general classes of protein structures , usually called folds [ 1 ] or topologies [ 2 ] , distinguished by how the main chain of the protein folds around itself in the three - dimensional space .
At the same time , the comparison of different approaches , both between and within the two classes , shows that fold / topologies ( or cluster ) definitions are somewhat fuzzy , with some proteins being occasionally difficult to classify and joining different groups depending on various assumptions .
This lead some to question the concept of the fold [ 9 ] , but practical application of protein structure comparison leaves little doubt that protein structure space has some natural granularity that overlaps well with the traditional fold classification .
Comparison and classification of protein structures is significantly simplified by the fact that proteins have naturally modular structures , being mostly composed of locally regular structures : alpha helices and beta strands .
These two types of secondary structures constitute a little over 50 % of an average protein ' s length .
With the average length of a secondary structure being around 10 amino acids , this makes it possible to describe protein structure as an arrangement of a much smaller number of elements .
Protein structures are often visualized in a simplified form , with the so - called ribbon diagram with secondary structures shown as helices and arrows being the most popular ( see Figure 1 ) .
This picture can be simplified further by showing individual secondary structure elements as simple symbols ( circles or boxes / triangles ) .
These depictions , called fold diagrams , originally proposed in the 70s [ 10 - 12 ] are best captured by a TOPS ( Topology of Protein Structures ) algorithm , which attempts to automate the process of creation of the topology cartoon [ 13 ] .
While useful in protein classification , such simplified descriptions are not used in the most popular automated protein structure comparison algorithms such as DALI [ 3 ] or CE [ 4 ] .
Kleywegt and Jones developed a method for finding similar motifs based on comparing distance matrices that are constructed by representing protein as a set of SSEs with their directional vectors and angle between those vectors [ 14 ] .
Programs that used SSEs either for structure comparison based on hierarchical superposition of both SSEs and atomic representation [ 15 ] or for finding common substructures in the comparison process based on subgraph isomorphism , such as [ 16 , 17 ] and recent applications of the TOPS diagram [ 18 , 19 ] , usually struggle with translating the comparison results from the secondary structure to the individual residue level .
Although the SSM method uses graph - matching procedures at the SSE level followed by an interactive 3D alignment of the protein C - alpha atom [ 20 ] , it lacks the topological relationships between the SSEs , which are essential features in identifying common scaffolds in distantly related proteins .
A TOPS pattern was used to guide the sequence alignment , for instance , to build multiple structural alignments of the distantly related family of beta - rich protein domains [ 21 ] .
The Multiple Sequence Alignment Tool ( MSAT ) automates this approach , merging it with a popular ClustalW program [ 22 ] .
DALI [ 3 ] , CE [ 4 ] or FATCAT [ 5 ] introduce their own methods of decomposing the protein structure into smaller units , such as 7 x 7 dense distance map fragments ( DALIs ) or aligned fragment pairs ( AFPs ) ( CE and FATCAT ) .
The large number of such fragments and the combinations of the fragments that need to be evaluated by structure comparison programs is the main reason for the significant computational requirements of such algorithms .
However , more importantly , TOPS + method is used here to enable a structural comparison that takes into account flexibility in protein structures and not only classifies the differences , but also can recognize such rearrangements - which is a first such application using the SSEs language .
In this contribution , we explore the question of whether it would be possible to combine insights provided by topology diagrams into automated protein structure alignment algorithms , focusing on the FATCAT program developed previously in our group .
Methods
Flexible structure alignment method FATCAT
FATCAT [ 5 ] is a unique structure alignment method that allows for flexibility in the structures being compared .
It builds the alignment by chaining aligned fragment pairs ( AFPs ) [ 23 ] together using a unified scoring function where AFP extensions , gaps , and twists each have their specific scores ( Figure 2 ) .
Introducing a twist into the alignment is penalized , but this penalty may be compensated for by the gain in the score of the resulting alignment ( i . e . , longer alignment and / or better RMSD ) .
Rigid alignment can be treated as a special case , in which no twist is allowed in chaining AFPs .
FATCAT program provides alignment in both , " rigid " mode and " flexible " ( default ) mode .
FATCAT , as well as most other protein structure comparison programs , is very slow when compared to sequence alignments .
The computing time of FATCAT is determined by the size of the collection of AFPs detected between the two structures being compared .
FATCAT is available from a server with an option to search in SCOP or PDB databases for similar structures .
This search typically takes between 8 to 16 hours of CPU time , and this is the main obstacle to broader use of this option .
FATCAT has been used to construct a Flexible Structure Neighborhood ( FSN ) database that contains pre - computed results of structure similarity searches and it takes several weeks of CPU time to update the FSN database .
Other protein structure comparison resources , such as DALI or CE have very similar problems .
TOPS cartoons and TOPS graph models
As discussed in the Background , TOPS cartoons capture the simplified , fold - level description of protein structure and at the same time can be automated [ 24 ] .
The TOPS algorithm uses structural features such as hydrogen bonds and chirality of the beta strands to provide a scoring function to optimize the cartoon ( see Figure 1 ( b ) ) .
In TOPS , the secondary structural elements ( SSEs ) are derived from the DSSP program [ 25 ] .
Based on TOPS cartoons , a formal graph model and graph - based definitions of protein topology and pattern discovery and comparison methods were developed [ 26 , 27 ] .
The TOPS database and comparison , pattern discovery and matching programs are accessible from .
Novel TOPS + and TOPS + strings models
The TOPS model was further enhanced to incorporate features such as protein - ligand interaction information and more detailed secondary structural segment information .
This enhanced model is called TOPS + model ( see Figure 3a ) .
This TOPS + model can be described formally in a TOPS + strings language ( Figure 3b ) at a reduced linear level .
The enhanced TOPS + strings models can be used in fast string - based structure matching and comparison , at the same time avoiding issues of NP - completeness associated with graph alignments .
In detail , each node ( SSE segment ) of the TOPS + strings is described by its type , orientation , PDB start number , segment length , total number of incoming ( InArc ) and outgoing ( OutArc ) arcs ( edges ) , total number of ArcTypes , and total number of ligand arcs ( LigArc ) .
The type of the segment ( SSEType ) could be one of [ E , e , H , h , U , u ] , where , " E " and " e " represent the " up " - and " down " - oriented beta strands ; " H " and " h " indicate the " up " - and " down " - oriented alpha helices ; and " U " and " u " represent ligand - bound and ligand - free loops .
The InArcType can be classified as an / a [ R , L , P , A ] , where " R " and " L " represent right and left chiralities ; and " P " and " A " represent parallel and anti - parallel hydrogen bonds , respectively .
The OutArcType is represented in a similar manner by [ R ' , L ' , P ' , A ' ] .
Ligand arcs are indicated by LT = AA , where LT is the ligand type and AA is the PDB number .
For example , Figure 3 ( a ) and 3 ( b ) contain visual representations of TOPS + and TOPS + strings models , respectively , for the protein domain d1fnb _ 1 .
Here the triangles represent the beta strands ; the red curve represents the alpha helix ; gray ellipsoids indicate loops ; and green arcs indicate hydrogen bonds between two beta strands , called anti - parallel beta sheets .
The length of a TOPS + strings model is defined by number of SSEs ; thus , the length of d1fnb _ 1 is 19 .
For further details , see [ 28 ] .
TOPS + strings comparison method
TOPS + is a comparison method that computes a distance between TOPS + strings models of two proteins based on a dynamic programming approach and identifies the longest common subsequence ( LCS ) , consisting of the list of the topologically equivalent SSEs between two proteins .
For example , Figure 3 ( c ) shows the TOPS + strings alignment between Dihydropteridine reductase proteins from rat ( 1dhr ) and human:__entity__ ( 1hdr ) .
The TOPS + strings models for 1dhr and 1hdr are represented by a linear string - model , where a yellow triangle and red curves indicate the beta strands and alpha helices in their " up " or " down " orientations , respectively .
The grey line and purple stubs represent the loop regions and the NAD ligand interactions , respectively .
Note that the ligand - interaction information is optional and in this work we have not used it .
The incoming and outgoing arcs are depicted in the SSEs ( top and bottom of the beta strands ) , where red and green arcs represent the parallel and anti - parallel hydrogen - bond interactions that show beta - sheet information , while yellow and blue arcs indicate the right and left chirality relationships between the SSEs .
A pink arrow between the TOPS + strings elements indicates the conserved SSE .
The dotted arrows indicate the conserved alpha helices and beta strands , while the plain arrows indicate the conserved loop regions .
TOPS + + FATCAT method
In this work , we want to test the general idea of pruning the search space of the FATCAT comparison process using topological constraints derived from the TOPS + strings alignment .
Many of the AFPs considered in the FATCAT alignment could be easily eliminated from the comparison by constraining the alignment region .
Here we explore constraints obtained from the TOPS + strings alignment , which identifies topologically equivalent secondary structure elements ( alpha helices , beta strands , and loops ) for this purpose .
Such equivalences define blocks that restrict the alignment region ; AFPs that fall outside these regions are simply not considered ( see Figure 4 ( b ) ) .
We introduce a parameter r to control the strictness of constraints by TOPS + strings alignments ; r equals 0 if the alignment region is strictly restrained by TOPS + strings alignment , and r is set to 1 by default in our program to allow certain flexibility to the constrained alignment region ( Figure 4 ( c ) ) .
We then can speed up the FATCAT alignment by considering only the AFPs within the constrained alignment area ( Figure 4 ( d ) ) .
The rigid structural alignment can be treated as a special case of TOPS + + FATCAT , in which no twist is allowed in chaining AFPs .
However , the TOPS + + FATCAT program provides alignment in both , " rigid " mode and " flexible " mode ( default ) .
Benchmarking
For benchmarking and comparison , we have used the PDB40 dataset of 1 , 901 protein domain pairs ( DP ) corresponding to SCOP version 1 . 61 from the ASTRAL database [ 29 ] .
Table 1 provides the SCOP superfamily level homolog versus non - homolog statistics for the four main SCOP classes i . e . , all - alpha , all - beta , alpha / beta , alpha + beta , and all proteins regardless of their structural classes .
Evaluation Analyses
We performed the Receiver Operating Characteristics ( ROC ) curve and the AUC ( Area Under the ROC Curve ) analyses to compare the performance of the TOPS + + FATCAT method with the original FATCAT method , using SCOP classification at the superfamily level as a standard of comparison [ 30 ] .
Results
ROC and AUC Analyses
We have compared the performance of the TOPS + + FATCAT method against the original FATCAT method using the SCOP classification information at the superfamily level .
We have plotted the ROC curves based on P - values obtained from the FATCAT and the TOPS + + FATCAT methods .
We have plotted the ROC curves separately for the main SCOP classes , i . e . , all - alpha , all - beta , alpha / beta , alpha + beta , and all proteins regardless of the class they belong to ( see Figure 5 ( a ) to 5 ( e ) ) .
In the graph , the x - and y - axes represent the false positive and true positive rates of the performance of the comparison methods respectively .
In the legend , rF - pvalue and fF - pvalue indicate results from the rigid and flexible FATCAT methods , respectively ; similarly , rT2F - pvalue and fT2F - pvalue represent the rigid and flexible TOPS + + FATCAT methods , respectively .
We have calculated the AUC values for all the SCOP classes based on ROC curves obtained from the FATCAT and TOPS + + FATCAT methods with the flexible / rigid options ( see Table 2 ) .
For all protein classes , the rigid FATCAT performs best , usually followed by the flexible FATCAT , the rigid TOPS + + FATCAT , and the flexible TOPS + + FATCAT .
The performance of all four methods is best for all alpha and all beta proteins , and all four perform markedly worse ( but similar to each other ) for alpha / beta proteins .
Only alpha + beta proteins show a clear difference between the FATCAT and TOPS + + FATCAT methods .
It is important to note that the TOPS + strings models consider the parallel and anti - parallel properties of the beta - sheet information in the form of total number of incoming and outgoing arcs with their ArcTypes .
Thus , the TOPS + + FATCAT method discriminates the protein domain pairs more efficiently compared to the original FATCAT method .
For example , in the all - beta protein domain pairs , both the flexible and the rigid TOPS + + FATCAT methods perform well .
The flexible TOPS + + FATCAT method covers nearly 84 % of protein domains with 0 % false positives , but the flexible and rigid FATCAT methods cover only 76 % and 49 % of the true positives , respectively , with 0 % false positives .
The zoomed - in version of the ROC curves with up to 10 % false positives for all - beta rich protein families is shown in Figure 5 ( f ) ; where both the rigid TOPS + + FATCAT ( green ) and flexible ( red ) TOPS + + FATCAT methods have coverage rates of 82 % and 84 % true positives respectively with 0 % false positives .
The overall results for all protein classes show that TOPS + + FATCAT performance is only slightly lower ( 3 % - 7 % AUC value difference ( see Table 2 ) ) as compared to FATCAT while providing a significant , more than 10 - fold speedup ( see next section ) .
AFP and Runtime Analyses
We tested both the FATCAT and TOPS + + FATCAT methods using the Mac OS X version 10 . 4 . 10 computer system with a 2 x 2 . 66 - GHz Dual - Core Intel Xeon processor and 1 - GB 667 MHz memory .
We have performed runtime analysis on 1 , 901 protein domain pairs and counted the total number of AFPs and the corresponding runtime from both the FATCAT and the TOPS + + FATCAT methods .
The results show an exponential increase in AFPs ( Figure 6 ( b ) ) and corresponding runtime ( Figure 6 ( a ) ) for the FATCAT method as compared to the TOPS + + FATCAT method ( see Table 3 ) For example , the average number of AFPs for the TOPS + + FATCAT method is 530 , but the average number of AFPs for the FATCAT method is 15 , 019 .
This represents the number of average AFPs used by the FATCAT method is increased by a factor of 28 ( see Table 3 ) .
This result leads to the conclusion that TOPS + + FATCAT is 22 times faster compared to the FATCAT because this method must take into account more number of AFPs in the comparison process ( see Table 3 ) .
Case Studies
While the overall accuracy of both rigid and flexible FATCAT methods is better than their TOPS + + FATCAT equivalents , an interesting example where the opposite is true lies in the comparison of two proteins , d2trxa _ ( 108 aa ) from Escherichia:__entity__ coli:__entity__ and d1kte _ _ ( 105 aa ) from Sus:__entity__ scrofa:__entity__ ( pig:__entity__ ) from the thioredoxin - like superfamily .
For this pair , the flexible _ TOPS + + FATCAT method provides an alignment with 88 equivalent positions with 1 . 67 A chain RMSD and 3 . 06 A of optimal RMSD without any twist , giving the alignment with 10 % sequence identity ( see Table 4 ) .
On the other hand , the flexible _ FATCAT method provides an alignment with 86 aligned positions using a twist in the C - terminal region ; it has a higher chain RMSD of 5 . 14 A , and its optimal RMSD is 3 . 48 A .
For more information regarding the chain and optimal RMSDs refer [ 5 ] .
The flexible _ FATCAT method uses the twist to align a helix in the C - terminal region , which is positioned incorrectly with a beta - sheet core ( see Table 4 ) .
Figure 7 ( a ) shows the superposition of d2trxa _ ( gray ) and d1kte _ _ ( orange ) domains from the flexible _ FATCAT method , where the blue color indicates the d1kte _ _ protein domain from the flexible _ TOPS + + FATCAT method .
The incorrect alignment of the C - terminal domain alpha helix of the d1kte _ _ domain ( orange ) is visible in the core of the beta - sheet region .
Figure 7 ( b ) and 7 ( c ) shows the AFPs from the flexible _ FATCAT and flexible _ TOPS + + FATCAT methods , respectively .
The hinge region provides a twist in the flexible _ FATCAT method indicated by an arrow and the AFPs represented by a different color ( see Figure 7 ( b ) ) .
In this case , the alignment constraints from the TOPS + strings alignment allow the TOPS + + FATCAT method to avoid a spurious alignment .
The Erythrocruorin protein domain d1eca _ _ ( 136 aa ) from Chironomus:__entity__ thummi:__entity__ and the Phycocyanin alpha subunit protein domain d1cpca _ ( 162 aa ) from Fremyella:__entity__ diplosiphon:__entity__ ( Cyanobacterium ) belong to the Globin - like superfamily .
For these protein domain pairs , the FATCAT method provides a better alignment with 120 and 118 aligned positions with the chain RMSD of 4 . 02 A based on the flexible and rigid options , respectively .
The flexible _ TOPS + + FATCAT method gives an alignment of 63 aligned positions with the 3 . 23 A optimal RMSD and the 6 . 28 A chain RMSD .
In this case , the flexible _ TOPS + + FATCAT method misses the N - terminal region helix and misaligns some helices .
For example , Figure 8 ( a ) shows the superposition of d1eca _ _ ( gray ) and d1cpca _ ( orange ) domains from the flexible _ FATCAT method , while d1cpca _ ( blue ) domain is from the flexible _ TOPS + + FATCAT method .
The AFP chaining alignment and the actual alignment from FATCAT are shown in Figure 8 ( b ) and 8 ( e ) , respectively .
Figure 8 ( c ) shows the AFP alignment from TOPS + + FATCAT , in which this method misses the N - terminal region and incorrectly aligns some of the C - terminal regions ( see Figure 8 ( d ) ) .
However , the rigid _ TOPS + + FATCAT method produces an alignment of 108 aligned positions with optimal and chain RMSDs of 3 . 22 A and 6 . 28 A respectively .
In general , TOPS comparison does not work well for alpha - rich proteins due to the lack of hydrogen bonds between SSEs [ 26 ] .
The same is true for TOPS + strings comparison to some extent ; however , this method takes advantage of ligand - interaction information to compare protein domains more efficiently ; for example the DNA binding motifs such as helix - turn - helix and helix - loop - helix can be easily recognized [ 28 ] .
However , we have not explored that ligand pattern discovery option within the TOPS + strings comparison in this paper .
In addition , the TOPS + strings alignment provides only a basic alignment ; the scoring function to find the best alignment has not been optimized .
These problems can be addressed in future development by considering the advanced TOPS + and TOPS + strings models based on helix - helix packing relationships and SSE - ligand interaction properties together with the right and left chiralities .
Furthermore , the TOPS + strings comparison can be optimized in both the comparison process as well as in the alignment process in order to take into account indels ( insertion / deletion ) of SSEs which exist in nature across the different members of the protein superfamilies [ 31 ] .
Discussion and conclusion
The overall results for all protein classes show that TOPS + + FATCAT performance is only slightly lower ( 3 % - 7 % AUC value difference ) as compared to FATCAT while providing a significant , more than 10 - fold speedup .
The main reason for the discrepancies is that TOPS + strings alignments occasionally misalign the secondary structure elements and subsequent FATCAT alignment , constrained by the TOPS + strings alignment , cannot overcome the earlier errors .
There is a clear trade - off between the runtime and the accuracy ; limiting the pool of fragments being compared speeds up the algorithm but results in ( slightly ) lower accuracy .
At the same time , these results offer clear suggestions for future development .
Using a more advanced version of the TOPS + strings comparison method would remove some of the false positives might be at a cost of significantly slowing the total performance of the TOPS + + FATCAT method .

Are there sensitive subgroups for the effects of airborne particles ?
Abstract
Recent studies have shown that particulate air pollution is a risk factor for hospitalization for heart and lung disease ; however , little is known about what subpopulations are most sensitive to this pollutant .
We analyzed Medicare hospital admissions for heart disease , chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders ( COPD ) and pneumonia in Chicago , Cook County , Illinois , between 1985 and 1994 .
We examined whether previous admissions or secondary diagnoses for selected conditions predisposed persons:__entity__ to having a greater risk from air pollution .
We also considered effect modification by age , sex , and race .
We found that the air - pollution - associated increase in hospital admissions for cardiovascular diseases was almost doubled in subjects with concurrent respiratory infections .
The risk was also increased by a previous admission for conduction disorders .
For COPD and pneumonia admissions , diagnosis of conduction disorders or dysrhythmias increased the risk of particulate matter < 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter ( PM ( 10 ) ) - associated admissions .
Persons:__entity__ with asthma had twice the risk of a PM ( 10 ) - associated pneumonia admission and persons:__entity__ with heart failure had twice the risk of PM ( 10 ) - induced COPD admissions .
The PM ( 10 ) effect did not vary by sex , age , and race .
These results suggest that patients:__entity__ with acute respiratory infections or defects in the electrical control of the heart are a risk group for particulate matter effects .

Particulate air pollution has been associated with increases in daily deaths and hospital admissions in studies all over the world ( 1 <FFFD> 15 ) .
These associations are now well documented but little is known , as yet , of the characteristics of persons:__entity__ that put them at increased risk of adverse events related to particulate air pollution .
This has been identified as a key data gap ( 16 ) .
Schwartz and Dockery ( 17 ) reported that persons:__entity__ older than 65 years of age had a somewhat increased risk of death , and this has been confirmed in other studies ( 18 ) .
A more detailed examination of particulate matter - related risk by deciles of age ( 19 ) showed the risk beginning to increase at approximately 40 years of age and reaching its maximum for those 75 years of age and older .
In addition to age , several studies suggest that persons:__entity__ with respiratory illness are at increased risk for cardiovascular effects associated with air pollution .
An examination of death certificates on high - and low - air pollution days reported a substantial difference in the proportion of deaths from cardiovascular causes that had respiratory disease as a contributing cause of death ( 19 ) .
A recent follow - up study of a cohort of persons:__entity__ with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) in Barcelona , Spain , found an association between particulate air pollution and all - cause mortality in the cohort ( 20 ) .
The magnitude of the risk per microgram per cubic meter of exposure was substantially greater than that for the general population .
Environmental Health Perspectives
Controlled exposure of animals with chronic bronchitis and control animals to concentrated air particles also demonstrated a potentiating effect of chronic lung disease in the response to airborne particles ( 21 ) .
This has led to the hypothesis that the cardiovascular effects of air pollution are predominantly in persons:__entity__ with chronic lung disease .
There has been even less done to examine potential modifiers of the effects of airborne particles on hospital admissions .
The existing literature on comorbidity shows that comorbidity per se seems to increase the risk of adverse outcomes ( 22 <FFFD> 30 ) .
Little is known about the role of these comorbidities as effect modifiers for the effects of air pollution .
This study uses data from the Medicare system to examine potential short - term and long - term medical conditions that may increase a person:__entity__ ' s risk of hospital admissions associated with particulate air pollution .
In addition , we examine potential effect modification by age , race , and sex .
Materials and Methods Health data .
The Health Care Financing Administration ( Baltimore , MD ) maintains records of every hospital admission for Medicare participants:__entity__ in the United States .
Persons:__entity__ in this database have a unique identifier .
Using this identifier , we traced every hospital admission for heart and lung disease for each person:__entity__ in Cook County , Illinois , between 1985 and 1994 .
We chose Cook County because it is the most populous
county in the United States with daily monitoring for particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter < 10 <FFFD> m ( PM10 ) .
The data were then analyzed to look at effect modification by concurrent and preexisting conditions as well as by age , race , and sex .
To establish a baseline risk , we computed daily counts of hospital admissions for cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) [ International Classification of Disease , 9th edition , World Health Organization , Geneva ( ICD - 9 ) code 390 <FFFD> 429 ] , pneumonia ( ICD - 9 code 480 <FFFD> 487 ) , and COPD ( ICD - 9 code 490 <FFFD> 496 , excluding 493 ) .
The association between these daily counts and PM10 was examined for the years 1988 <FFFD> 1994 , when daily PM10 monitoring data were available in Chicago .
Once our baseline risks were established , we examined three classes of potential effect modifiers .
First , we looked at whether previous admissions for selected conditions predisposed persons:__entity__ to having a greater risk from air pollution .
For each of the three admission categories ( CVD , pneumonia , and COPD ) , we considered 10 causes ( defined by a previous admission ) as effect modifiers : COPD ( ICD - 9 code 490 <FFFD> 496 except 493 ) , asthma ( ICD - 9 code 493 ) , acute bronchitis ( ICD - 9 code 466 ) , acute respiratory illness ( ICD - 9 code 460 <FFFD> 466 ) , pneumonia ( ICD - 9 code 480 <FFFD> 487 ) , CVD ( ICD - 9 code 390 <FFFD> 429 ) , myocardial infarction ( ICD - 9 code 410 ) , congestive heart failure ( ICD - 9 code 428 ) , conduction disorders ( ICD - 9 code 426 ) , and dysrhythmias ( ICD9 code 427 ) .
To test the hypothesis that persons:__entity__ with these conditions had higher risks of subsequent PM10 - related admissions , we computed separate daily counts of admissions for our three target causes , stratified by whether or not the person:__entity__ admitted had been previously admitted for the hypothesized predisposing condition .
Separate analyses were then performed within each strata to see if the effects of PM10 differed by strata .

The second set of potential predisposing conditions included secondary diagnoses associated with the index admission .
These could represent the presence of a chronic condition ( e . g . , COPD ) that has not resulted in a previous hospital admission .
They could also represent acute conditions that may have increased the subjects ' sensitivity to air pollution .
For example , if respiratory infections modified the effect of particulate matter on the cardiovascular health of persons:__entity__ with underlying heart disease , then the risk of a hospital admission for heart disease might be different in persons:__entity__ with infections .
If this were true , then the risk ratio of a 10 - <FFFD> g / m3 increase of PM10 on cardiovascular admissions of persons:__entity__ with a concurrent respiratory infection would be different from the ratio in persons:__entity__ without respiratory infection .
To test these hypotheses , we computed separate daily counts of admissions for events with and without the concurrent conditions hypothesized to increase sensitivity to air pollution .
These were taken as the same 10 conditions in the first analysis with certain exclusions for pairing that would be illogical .
That is , the concurrent diagnosis of a specific cardiac condition was not treated as an effect modifier for admissions for any cardiovascular condition .
Likewise , pneumonia and COPD were not possible concurrent conditions for each other .
The third set of predisposing conditions considered was being older than 75 years of age , nonwhite , and female .
These were examined for all three outcomes .
We obtained weather data for O ' Hare Airport from the EarthInfo CD - ROM ( EarthInfo CD NCDC Surface Airways , EarthInfo Inc . , Boulder , CO ) , and we obtained air pollution data from the U . S .
Environmental Protection Agency Aerometric Information Retrieval System network ( 31 ) .
running - line smoother , loess ( 35 ) , was chosen to estimate the smooth function .
To control for weather variables and day of the week , we chose the smoothing parameter that minimized the Akaike ' s information criterion ( 36 ) .
To model seasonality we chose the smoothing parameter that minimized the sum of the autocorrelation of the residuals while removing seasonal patterns .
Two autoregressive terms ( 37 ) were added in the model to eliminate the remaining serial correlation from the residuals .
We used the mean of PM10 on the day of the admission and the day before the admission as our exposure variable .
This gives results that are similar to those obtained fitting a full distributed lag model ( 38 ) .
PM10 was treated linearly .
Our baseline models used the daily counts of CVD , pneumonia , and COPD admissions as outcomes .
We then subdivided those counts by the presence or absence of the potential effect modifier and reestimated our regressions on those subgroups .
We considered effect modification to be indicated when the estimates of PM10 in the group with the condition was outside of the 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) of the effect estimate in persons:__entity__ without the condition .
Results Table 1 shows the mean daily admissions for COPD , cardiovascular , and pneumonia both overall and in the presence of the potential effect modifiers .
For some effect modifiers such as conduction disorders or myocardial infarctions , the counts in conjunction with our respiratory outcomes are
low , which limits power .
In general , the numbers are lower for examining effect modification by previous admissions than for effect modification by concurrent diagnosis .
This is as expected because many clinically relevant comorbidities may never have resulted in a hospital admission .
Table 2 shows the 25th , 50th , and 75th percentile values for the environmental variables .
The mean value for PM10 is 33 <FFFD> g / m3 .
The daily values for PM10 were computed as the average of 10 monitors , two of which measured PM10 almost every day and the others less frequently ( 38 ) .
Table 3 shows the mean daily counts of CVD , COPD , and pneumonia by sex , age groups , and race .
The distribution by sex is almost even , although the counts of admissions for males are generally lower ( approximately 10 % ) than for females , particularly for cardiovascular diseases .
The counts of CVD , COPD , and pneumonia admissions were similar for people:__entity__ 65 <FFFD> 75 or 75 years of age and older .
Tables 4 <FFFD> 6 show the results for the effect PM10 overall and stratifying by concurrent diagnosis and previous admissions .
These are expressed as the percentage increase for 10 <FFFD> g / m3 PM10 .
Table 4 shows the results for CVD .
A 10 - <FFFD> g / m3 increase in PM10 was associated with a 1 . 31 % ( 5 % CI , 0 . 97 % ; 95 % CI , 1 . 66 % ) increase in hospital admissions for heart disease in all elderly persons:__entity__ .
A concurrent ( not previous ) diagnosis of COPD modified the risk of PM10 - associated admissions for heart disease .
However , significant associations were still seen between PM10

Methods We analyzed the data with a generalized additive robust Poisson regression model ( 32 ) .
This approach has become the norm in such studies ( 14 , 33 , 34 ) .
In the generalized additive model the outcome is assumed to depend on a sum of nonparametric smooth functions for each variable that models the potential nonlinear dependence of daily admission on weather and season .
The model is of the form : log [ E ( Yt ) ] = 0 + S1 ( X1 ) + . . .
+ Sp ( Xp ) where E ( Yt ) is the expected value of the daily count of admissions Yt and Si are the smooth functions of the covariates Xi .
We examined temperature , previous day ' s temperature , relative humidity , barometric pressure , and day of week covariates .

Effects of particles on sensitive subgroups
and heart disease admissions in persons:__entity__ without COPD listed as either a comorbidity or a cause of previous admission ( Table 4 ) .
A significant association was also seen in persons:__entity__ without any respiratory disease as a concurrent diagnosis , although the risk is much lower than in persons:__entity__ with respiratory disease .
However , the risk associated with PM10 was roughly doubled in subjects with concurrent respiratory infections and the risk estimates in those subjects were outside the 95 % CI of the risk in patients:__entity__ without concurrent respiratory infections .
A previous admission for conduction disorders ( e . g . , heart block ) increased the risk of a PM10 - related subsequent admission for any heart condition , and a weaker indication of effect modification was seen for persons:__entity__ with previous admission for dysrhythmias .
In contrast heart failure and previous myocardial infarctions were highly insignificant as effect modifiers .
Table 5 shows the results for COPD .
Overall , there is a 1 . 89 % ( 95 % CI , 0 . 8 <FFFD> 3 . 0 ) increase in COPD admissions for a 10 <FFFD> g / m3 increase in PM10 .
The results of the stratified analysis suggest that preexisting heart disease modifies Table 4 .

the risk of COPD admissions on high particle days .
Previous admissions for any cardiovascular disease increased the risk of a PM10associated COPD admission approximately 2 . 5 - fold .
A previous heart failure admission caused an even more striking increase in the PM10 effect .
Previous admissions for dysrhythmias and conduction defects were rare ( Table 1 ) with no power to examine effect modifications .
Listings as concurrent diagnoses were more common and here they joined heart failure in increasing the risk of PM 10 - associated COPD admissions .
For COPD there was also some indication that concurrent pneumonia or an acute respiratory infection admission in the last year increased risk .
The low numbers made these estimates less precise , however .
The percentage increase in pneumonia admission ( Table 6 ) for 10 <FFFD> g / m3 PM10 is higher than for COPD or CVD with an increase of 2 . 34 % ( 95 % CI , 1 . 66 <FFFD> 3 . 0 ) .
As with COPD , persons:__entity__ with heart disease appeared at higher risk of pneumonia hospital admissions associated with particulate air pollution .
Here diagnoses suggestive of impaired autonomic control of the heart , such as conduction disorders or dysrhythmias , were associated with increased risk for PM 10 effects on pneumonia admissions .
Unlike COPD , no difference was seen for congestive heart failure .

had twice the risk of a PM10 - induced pneumonia admission as persons:__entity__ without asthma .
Table 7 shows the results by sex , age , and race .
None of the effect size estimates for any of the stratification variables were outside of the 95 % CI for the opposite strata .
There was a tendency for the effect of PM10 on CVD admissions to be higher for females , whereas the effect on pneumonia admissions was higher for males .
In general , we found somewhat larger effects on whites compared to nonwhites , and for persons:__entity__ older than 75 years of age compared to younger persons:__entity__ .
Discussion In this analysis we examined whether the effect of PM10 on the risk of hospital admission for heart and lung disease was different depending on the presence of comorbidities .
We found that PM10 was associated with hospital admissions for all three causes ( CVD , COPD , and pneumonia ) and we found not a general increase in PM10 related risk with comorbidities , but a specific pattern that is suggestive of potential mechanisms and consistent with other recent epidemiologic and toxicologic findings .
One major finding of this study is that preexisting cardiovascular disease , particularly impaired autonomic control ( conduction defects and dysrhythmias ) and heart failure , substantially increased the risk of respiratory admissions associated with airborne particles .
In fact , recent human:__entity__ studies have shown that exposure to particulate air pollution is a risk factor for reduced heart rate variability ( 39 <FFFD> 41 ) .
Reduced heart rate variability is an adverse response and a risk factor for arrhythmia .
A new study of defibrillator discharges in patients:__entity__ with implanted cardioverter defibrillators found that discharges were associated with air pollution ( 42 ) .

Figures shown are the percentage increase in admissions ( 95 % CI ) .
particles has also been associated with arrhythmia in an animal model ( 43 ) and changes in ST segments have been noted as well ( 44 ) .
This is the first study to suggest persons:__entity__ with defects in the electrical control of the heart are also at higher risk of respiratory illness after exposure to airborne particles .
These data also suggest that persons:__entity__ admitted to hospitals for pneumonia during an air pollution episode may be at high risk for clinically significant conduction disorders during that hospital admission .
Patients:__entity__ with congestive heart failure were at greater risk of hospital admissions for COPD in association with airborne particles .
Heart failure and COPD is not an uncommon combination .
The finding that these patients:__entity__ are at higher risk for admissions associated with particulate air pollution is new but is also consistent with several other recent reports .
The spontaneous hypertensive rat:__entity__ develops a model of heart failure , and recent studies have reported greater sensitivity to particulate air pollution in these rats:__entity__ .
These include both electrocardiogram abnormalities ( 44 ) and pulmonary toxicity ( 45 , 46 ) .
Similarly , in an epidemiologic study , Hoek et al .
( 47 ) , found a higher relative risk of death with an increase in PM10 for congestive heart failure deaths than other deaths .
The potential role of COPD in those heart failure deaths was not examined .
Another consistent pattern in our data is of acute respiratory infections increasing susceptibility to airborne particles .
Acute bronchitis , or more generally acute upper respiratory illnesses , as well as pneumonia , increased susceptibility to particle - associated admissions for CVD and COPD .
The notion that air pollution exacerbates acute respiratory infections is well supported by studies which report associations between airborne particles and hospital admissions for respiratory infections ( 48 , 49 ) .
Zelikoff et al .
( 50 ) exposed rats:__entity__ infected with streptococcus to concentrated air particles and reported a significant increase in bacterial burdens and in the extent of pneumonia compared to animals exposed to filtrated air .
This suggests an impaired immune response .
Similarly , exposure to combustion
particles enhances influenza infections in mice:__entity__ ( 51 ) .
An impaired defense to respiratory infection is a major reason that persons:__entity__ with COPD require hospital admission .
If airborne particles result in further impairment the effect modification we observe makes good sense .
The effect modification for heart disease admissions is more relevant .
This modification is consistent with the earlier report of Schwartz ( 19 ) , who found greater reports of respiratory complications on death certificates with an underlying cause of heart disease if the death occurred on a day with high levels of airborne particles .
Although airborne particle exposure has been associated with increased exacerbation of asthma ( 2 , 12 , 48 , 52 <FFFD> 59 ) , this paper is the first to suggest that asthmatics are more susceptible to PM10 - induced pneumonia exacerbation or to cardiovascular effects .
The effects on pneumonia admissions are plausible , given the impaired ability to fight off infections in asthmatics with mucus plugs and the evidence the airborne particles impair the lungs ' ability to fight off bacterial and viral infections , as noted earlier .
The increased cardiovascular sensitivity , albeit weaker , is interesting .
If airborne particles affect the cardiovascular system via the role of the lung in autonomic control , it is possible that asthmatics would be more sensitive to those effects .
Animal models of asthma showed that combustion particles enhance the asthmatic response to aeroallergen challenges ( 59 ) .
This suggests an enhancement of pulmonary response in asthmatics .
On the other hand , the diagnosis of asthma is problematic in the elderly , and crossover with COPD is possible .
The possibility that this explains our results is reduced by our failure to find previous hospital admission for COPD was an effect modifier for the effect of particles on cardiovascular admissions .
We must acknowledge several potential limitations of this study .
First , we considered only previous admissions that occurred within Cook County .
Hence persons:__entity__ with previous admissions elsewhere would be misclassified to our reference group .
The effect of this would be to reduce the difference in PM 10 effect between the two groups .
VOLUME
Nevertheless , we identified some interesting interactions .
We cannot exclude the possibility that there are areas we missed for this reason .
We also examined interactions in a log relative risk model , which is inherently multiplicative .
Although we believe this is justified because doubling the population exposed would be expected to double the pollution associated admissions , it results in a more conservative definition of interaction than would an additive risk model .
Finally , our exposure is clearly measured with error .
Most of this error is Berkson error ( 60 ) and hence will introduce no bias , and Zeger et al .
( 60 ) showed that the remaining error would have to have pathologic correlations with other variables to result in an upward bias .
Another important result from this study , of course , is an estimate of the magnitude of the effect of airborne particles on public health .
The PM10 concentrations in Chicago during this period were associated with approximately 1 , 600 additional admissions per year for heart disease , 740 additional admissions per year for pneumonia , and 170 additional admissions per year for COPD .
These are not trivial increases in serious morbidity .
The results of our study should be replicated in additional cities , although they do begin to fill in some missing information about the effects of airborne particles on health .
More generally airborne particles have been associated with a broad range of systemic changes including heart rate variability ( 39 <FFFD> 41 ) , increased peripheral neutrophils ( 61 <FFFD> 63 ) , increased plasma viscosity ( 64 ) , an increase in blood pressure ( 65 ) , and the outcomes mentioned previously .
The role of these systemic changes as potential sources of the specific effect modifications we have seen should be an area of fruitful research in the future .

Syndrome of arachnomelia in Simmental cattle:__entity__
Abstract
Background
The syndrome of arachnomelia is an inherited malformation mainly of limbs , back and head in cattle:__entity__ .
At present the arachnomelia syndrome has been well known mainly in Brown Swiss cattle:__entity__ .
Nevertheless , the arachnomelia syndrome had been observed in the Hessian Simmental population during the decade 1964 - 1974 .
Recently , stillborn Simmental calves:__entity__ were observed having a morphology similar to the arachnomelia syndrome .
The goal of this work was the characterization of the morphology and genealogy of the syndrome in Simmental to establish the basis for an effective management of the disease .
Results
The first pathologically confirmed arachnomelia syndrome - cases in the current Simmental population appeared in the year 2005 .
By 2007 , an additional 140 calves:__entity__ with the arachnomelia syndrome were identified .
The major pathological findings were malformed bones affecting the head , long bones of the legs and the vertebral column .
It could be shown that , with the exception of two cases that were considered as phenocopies , all of the paternal and about two - third of the maternal pedigrees of the affected calves:__entity__ could be traced back to one common founder .
Together with the data from experimental matings , the pedigree data support an autosomal recessive mutation being the etiology of the arachnomelia syndrome .
The frequency of the mutation in the current population was estimated to be 3 . 32 % .
Conclusion
We describe the repeated occurrence of the arachnomelia syndrome in Simmental calves:__entity__ .
It resembles completely the same defect occurring in the Brown Swiss breed .
The mutation became relatively widespread amongst the current population .
Therefore , a control system has to be established and it is highly desirable to map the disease and develop a genetic test system .
Background
In the year 2006 a syndrome was described in the German and Austrian Simmental ( Fleckvieh , as it is locally called , is the main dual - purpose breed in Germany , in short called Simmental in the further text ) population , that was pathologically similar to the arachnomelia syndrome in Brown Swiss cattle:__entity__ [ 1 ] .
The congenital arachnomelia syndrome ( AS , OMIA Phene ID 139 , Group 000059 ) is mainly a malformation of the skeletal system in cattle:__entity__ that was initially described by Rieck and Schade [ 2 ] in Holstein Friesian , Red Holstein and Simmental .
The main pathological changes are skeletal malformations of the legs , the spinal column and the skull .
The legs are thinner and appear longer than normal ( dolichostenomelia , arachnomelia ) since the diameter of the diaphyses is reduced .
These long bones are more fragile and , in combination with stiffened joints , they tend to fracture during calving .
The fetlock joints are deformed , often stiffened and show hyperextension .
The malformation of the spinal column leads to kyphosis and scoliosis .
The skull malformations are characterized by a shortened lower jaw ( brachygnathia inferior ) , convex rounding of the frontal bone leading to a marked stop ( " pointer head " ) and rotation of the anterior cranium .
In some cases , additional malformations like hydrocephalus externus develop [ 2 - 5 ] .
Since the report of Rieck and Schade [ 2 ] no further cases were reported in Simmental cattle:__entity__ , but in the 1980s the syndrome was dispersed in another breed , the European Brown Swiss cattle:__entity__ , by the use of American Brown Swiss sires [ 4 , 6 ] .
In Brown Swiss an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance was supposed and a control program based on the identification of carriers by pedigree analyses was established [ 5 ] .
Recently , four cases of arachnomelia syndrome were reported in Italy [ 3 ] .
In this study , we present the data of 152 pathologically confirmed cases of arachnomelia syndrome in Simmental that were collected from October 2005 to March 2007 .
We describe the pathological findings , the familial occurrence and an estimate of the frequency of the diseases allele in Simmental cattle:__entity__ .
Additional support for the mode of inheritance and the genetic basis of the arachnomelia syndrome is given by the result of experimental matings of obligate carriers .
Results and discussion
AS has not been reported again in Simmental since its first description in the 1970s , more than thirteen years ago .
In autumn 2004 a number of stillborn calves:__entity__ with similar malformations of the legs and head were recorded within the monitoring system of anomalies in Simmental .
Some of these calves:__entity__ were sent to the veterinary service laboratory for examination , and in December 2005 the first 15 cases of AS were pathologically confirmed .
Subsequently , farmers and veterinarians had been encouraged to report cases by an information leaflet and various articles in local trade journals .
An increasing number of suspected cases was reported and an additional 136 affected calves:__entity__ were identified by pathological examination by June 2007 .
Familial occurrence and case presentation of the syndrome of arachnomelia
The geographical origins of the cases were the southern part of Germany and Austria , reflecting the regional distribution of the Simmental breed .
Both sexes were equally represented in the 152 ( 80 male , 72 female , chi 2 = 0 . 21 , p = 0 . 64 ) affected calves:__entity__ .
The largest number of cases was registered in 2006 ( Figure 1 ) .
In retrospect , it could be shown that the main reason for the rapid increase of cases in the years 2005 and 2006 was the high popularity of certain sires carrying the AS mutation ( ROMEL , ISO - Nr . 276000911043667 , born in 1995 ; EGEL , 276000915512806 , 1985 ; REXON , 276000913008210 , 1989 ) .
The latter two sires represent the key - nodes of the pedigree pathways of the mutation from the founder into the current population ( Figure 2 ) .
ROMEL , for example , sired more than 40 , 000 cows:__entity__ 4 to 6 years ago .
Furthermore , 115 sons of ROMEL born from 2001 to 2005 are registered and listed in the breeding database [ 7 ] .
These progeny were now mated to ROMEL and sons or grandsons of EGEL and REXON resulting in a high probability for the occurrence of affected calves:__entity__ .
Increasing awareness of the disease and abandoning of selling the semen from carriers led to a sharp drop of cases in 2007 .
The disease was successfully managed by efficient collaboration of the Institute for Animal Breeding of the Bavarian State Research Centre for Agriculture ( LfL ) , the Landeskuratorium der Erzeugerringe f u r tierische Veredelung in Bayern e . V ( LKV ) , the Bavarian Animal Health Service ( TGD ) and breeding organizations .
Pathological findings
Calves:__entity__ under suspicion of the arachnomelia syndrome were sent to the pathology department of the TGD for macroscopic examination .
The observed major pathological findings were ( 1 ) facial deformation , including brachygnathia inferior and concave rounding of the maxilla forming a dent ( ' pointer - head ' ) ; ( 2 ) abnormally thin diaphyses of the long bones ( the outer diameter of the diaphyses is diminished , whereas the width of the substantia compacta is normal ) leading to frequent fractures of the metacarpus and metatarsus in the course of forced birth assistance ( ' spider - legs ' , dolichostenomelia ) .
The deformations of other bones of the legs were less apparent and the scapula was usually unaffected ; ( 3 ) angular deformations of the distal parts of the legs characterized by bilateral stiff and hyperextended fetlocks with the extremity of the toe forward and parallel to the trunk of the body ; and ( 4 ) defects of the vertebral column ( kyphosis and scoliosis ) , but not of the ribs ( Figure 3A - C ) .
Additionally , inconsistent pathological findings included cerebral herniation combined with a malformed foramen magnum , microphthalmia , and external and internal hydrocephalus .
The latter seem to develop secondarily , due to the enlarged foramen magnum .
Histological examination of selected cases revealed the presence of hemorrhages at the osteochondral junction of the epiphysis and an abrupt transmission from chondral to osteogenic tissue .
Cases never showed isolated malformations , e . g . of the head or legs , but usually a combination of all pathological findings that are characteristic for the syndrome .
Nevertheless , the degree of the lesions ranged from obvious spider - leg cases to moderate or mild changes , making a definite diagnosis difficult .
The latter cases ( 3 ) were excluded from the initial pedigree analyses .
Meanwhile , an indirect gene test is available that has been developed at the Institute for Animal Breeding of the Bavarian State Research Centre for Agriculture ( ITZ ) and it could be shown that these cases are most probably not genetically affected ( Buitkamp et al . , in preparation ) .
Carrier identification
Two criteria were used for carrier identification .
The first was the presence of a calf:__entity__ that was diagnosed by pathological investigation .
In many cases more than one affected calf:__entity__ per sire was identified [ 8 ] .
Some sires had only one affected calf:__entity__ , but a large number of risk - matings .
In these cases a second criterion , the statistical evaluation of risk - matings , was used to identify potential phenocopies .
For this purpose , the probability of observing only a single affected calf:__entity__ among a certain number of risk - matings of the sire in question was calculated .
Risk - matings were defined as matings with direct progenies of identified AS carriers .
The probability of observing an affected calf:__entity__ depends also on the probability that such a calf:__entity__ is reported to the LKV .
We assumed this probability to be 50 % .
Under these conditions , the probability of observing only one affected calf:__entity__ is lower than 1 . 0 percent , if at least 104 risk - matings are given for a single sire .
In this case it is very likely that the single affected calf:__entity__ is a phenocopy .
In 2006 and 2007 this was the case for two sires used for artificial insemination that had no pedigree connection to SEMPER ( see below ) .
Experimental matings of obligate carriers
Four out of seven cows:__entity__ that were known AS carriers brought to the facilities of the ITZ were used for embryo transfer ( Table 1 ) .
33 of the 60 recipients ( 55 % ) were confirmed pregnant on day 35 .
Four of the 33 pregnant heifers ( 12 % ) aborted between days 36 and 49 of pregnancy .
Of the remaining 29 recipients , 6 were slaughtered on day 150 , 6 on day 200 , and 17 animals on day 225 of pregnancy ( Table 1 ) .
Four fetuses ( three male and one female ) out of 29 ( 14 % ) showed the typical pathological changes of the arachnomelia syndrome as described above ( Figure 4C , D ) .
All other fetuses showed no signs of AS ( Figure 4A , B ) .
Male fetuses represented 76 % ( 22 of 29 ) of pregnancies ( chi 2 = 3 . 123 , p = 0 . 077 , Yates corrected for sample size < 30 ) .
Female weight ( Table 2 ) , crown - rump length at day 225 and chest circumference at day 225 of normal fetuses were lower than that of male fetuses .
Fetuses that were affected by the arachnomelia syndrome showed lower weight than normal fetuses .
The affected and the normal fetuses had similar crown - rump length , but the chest circumference of affected fetuses was higher than that of normal fetuses ( Table 2 ) .
Due to the small number of affected female fetuses , a comparison with unaffected animals for sex was not possible .
To compare unaffected and affected animals in total , the data were analyzed for statistical differences by the non parametric Mann - Whitney - Test .
The only trait that was significantly different between unaffected and affected fetuses was the chest circumference ( p = 0 . 004 , Table 2 ) .
The body weight of AS affected calves:__entity__ was tendentially lower than that of normal calves:__entity__ .
Since affected calves:__entity__ did not have different crown - rump - length and their chest circumference was even higher , this can best be explained by a reduced bone mass .
Pedigree Analysis and mode of inheritance
Eight - generation pedigrees of all cases were extracted from the joint German and Austria pedigree data and screened for common ancestors .
The pedigree of the majority of affected calves:__entity__ ( paternal line 150 , maternal line 106 out of 152 , Table 3 ) could be traced back to one founder , SEMPER ( ISO - Nr . 27000979299305 ) , a sire born in 1964 , 6 - 9 generations before the affected calves:__entity__ were born ( Figure 2 ) .
Most of the affected calves:__entity__ inherited the AS mutation via REXON or EGEL ( Table 3 , Figure 2 ) .
In 44 cases the maternal paths were not linked to the common pedigree ( Table 3 ) .
One explanation would be the existence of additional , hereto unknown origins of the mutation .
This could happen if the AS mutation is much more ancient and additional pedigree paths exist or if an independent mutation event happened leading to the same phenotype .
An alternative , more plausible explanation could be the occurrence of misparentages .
It is well known that in the pre parentage - test era , the frequency of false paternity , especially of the cows:__entity__ , was reasonable high ( up to 23 % [ 9 ] ) .
Therefore , there is a good chance of a false registry within 6 - 9 generations .
There is strong support for the assumption that the AS is regulated by a single autosomal locus acting in a recessive manner .
First of all , the pedigree structure of the affected calves:__entity__ in Simmental can best be explained by a recessive mode of inheritance .
The paternal branch of the pedigree could be traced back to one sire , SEMPER , for all affected calves:__entity__ , the maternal branch in the majority of the cases .
Inbreeding loops over a few generations are present in several pedigrees of affected calves:__entity__ , e . g . cases P3364 and P1787 ( Figure 2 ) .
Sex - dependent inheritance can obviously be excluded and a dominant mode with reduced penetrance seems to be unlikely .
Secondly , the experimental matings resulted in 4 affected and 25 unaffected fetuses , a result that most closely resembles the expectation of a recessive mode of inheritance .
Thirdly , the occurrence of cases corresponded well with the numbers expected under the assumption of a recessively acting mutation .
We tested this on the progeny of ROMEL , the largest dataset available from one carrier .
We analyzed the period from the beginning of the recording system for malformations to May 2007 .
In that period 44 , 170 calves:__entity__ were born that were sired by ROMEL .
From these , 662 were considered as risk pairings , i . e . the mother had a risk of 0 . 5 to be a carrier ( i . e . one of the grandparents was an obligate carrier ) and 35 calves:__entity__ out of these were diagnosed as affected .
Since it is expected that about 1 / 2 to 1 / 3 of the affected calves:__entity__ were recorded , this result is very close to the expected 1 : 7 ratio of affected to unaffected calves:__entity__ .
Moreover , these findings are concordant with the historical description of the arachnomelia syndrome in Simmental [ 2 ] and the analyses of cases in Brown Swiss [ 5 ] .
Finally , when applying linkage analyses using microsatellite markers , evaluations with a model assuming recessive autosomal inheritance gave the highest lod scores ( Buitkamp et al . , in preparation ) .
Allelic frequency of carriers in the present Simmental cow:__entity__ population
Since the arachnomelia syndrome - allele was passed to the current population through two parental lines ( REXON and EGEL ) and the main carriers are known , it is possible to estimate the frequency of the disease allele by an allele - counting method [ 10 ] .
The allelic frequency was calculated for all cows:__entity__ from the breeding population who were alive in June 2007 .
In 10 . 4 percent of the pedigrees of 540 , 725 cows:__entity__ an identified carrier was found and the probability that individual cows:__entity__ were carrier of the arachnomelia syndrome - allele was calculated .
E . g . in 14 , 740 and 41 , 032 cases a known carrier appeared as sire and grandsire , respectively .
In these cases the probability of transmitting the allele is 50 and 25 percent , respectively , if no further carrier is present in the two generation pedigree .
The averaged rate of the arachnomelia syndrome carriers based on known carriers over all cows:__entity__ alive in Bavarian Simmental was 3 . 32 percent .
Using this approach , the frequency of carriers was calculated for each year ( always based on the actual datasets from August 2008 ) from 2003 to 2008 ( Figure 1 ) .
The calculations were done twice , considering all known carriers together , and also by using only ROMEL as a carrier to show the numeric contribution of his progeny ( Figure 1 ) .
For these analyses , the sires that are designated to be non - carriers by the number of risk pairings without having a case or the indirect gene test are set as non - carrier .
Therefore , these frequencies are slightly lower than the initial frequency estimate of 3 . 32 percent .
Conclusion
The cases of malformed Simmental calves:__entity__ presented here showed the same morphology described in the arachnomelia syndrome in Brown Swiss [ e . g . [ 3 ] ] , even though there is a certain morphological variation from mild to severe malformations .
The main findings , brachygnathia inferior and convex frontal bone of the face , deformation of vertebrae , and dysplasia of the limbs , namely the diaphyses of metatarsus and - carpus and the fetlocks , can best be explained by irregularly developed bone structure at the corresponding locations .
Without pathological examination it is difficult to distinguish the arachnomelia syndrome from other malformations of the limbs .
Therefore , low numbers of cases in Simmental probably passed unrecognized before 2005 .
In that year the allelic frequency of the disease in the cow:__entity__ population increased sharply because some sires that had been carriers of the mutation had become very popular 2 - 4 years before .
The identification of a common ancestor , the results from the experimental matings and the analyses of numbers of cases from risk matings strongly support the hypothesis of an autosomal recessively inherited disease .
Furthermore , this assumption is concordant with the historical description of the syndrome in Simmental and Brown Swiss .
The allelic frequency of the arachnomelia syndrome in the current population is well above 3 percent and a substantial number of progeny from known carriers with superior genetic merit shall be used as sires during the next years .
Therefore , a control system has to be established and the arachnomelia syndrome - gene should be mapped as a prerequisite for the development of an indirect gene test for carrier identification .
The availability of pathologically well characterized cases from the field and from the ET - generated full - sib families will be an excellent material for a genetic mapping procedure .
Methods
Recording system for congenital malformations
A system for monitoring inherited congenital malformations in Bavarian cattle:__entity__ populations was established by the Institute for Animal Breeding of the Bavarian State Research Centre for Agriculture ( ITZ ) in cooperation with the Bavarian milk recording organization ( LKV ) [ 11 ] .
In short , a questionnaire was developed for detailed recording of malformed calves:__entity__ .
The malformation was described according to its location ( e . g . head , legs ) and its characteristics ( e . g . hernia ) .
The standardized data were stored in a database at the LKV , that is evaluated monthly for a potential genetic background of malformations .
Sires that fit into the pedigree ( progeny of REXON or EGEL ) with at least one affected calf:__entity__ with confirmed paternity were defined as obligate carriers and marked in the breeding information system [ 7 ] .
In cases without connection to the pedigree and only one recorded calf:__entity__ the number of " risk pairings " ( matings to cows:__entity__ where at least one parent is a known carrier , enabling the calculation of the probability for the occurrence of cases ) was calculated .
When the probability that a case occurs was above 99 % for the sire in question the case was considered to be a phenocopy .
The number of calves:__entity__ affected by the arachnomelia syndrome and their parentage is routinely published [ 8 ] .
Pathological examinations
Pathological examinations followed standard procedures .
Calves:__entity__ were photographed and size and weight measurements were recorded .
Tissue specimens from the condyle ( epiphysis ) and from the diaphysis of the femur were collected for histological examination .
Specimens were fixed in 10 % formalin and kept in a decalcifying solution ( Ossafixonafor ) for 24 hours .
Thereafter , specimens were processed in an automated embedding system , sectioned at 4 - 6 microns and finally stained with haematoxyline and eosin .
Experimental matings and embryo transfer
Known carriers of the arachnomelia syndrome ( seven cows:__entity__ that had produced at least one affected calf:__entity__ ) were brought to the facilities of the ITZ for embryo transfer ( Table 1 ) .
Late morulae and blastocysts collected on day 7 ( day 0 = estrus ) from superovulated donor cows:__entity__ were nonsurgically transferred to heifers [ 12 ] .
Mode of inheritance and allele frequency
The pedigree of all cases was constructed from the pedigree that is used for the joint breeding evaluation of Germany and Austria .
The graphical presentation of the pedigree was performed with the Pedigraph TM software [ 13 ] .
The allelic frequency of the AS mutation in the current cow:__entity__ population was estimated from ancestors with known genotypes following the allele - counting method [ 10 ] .
For this reason two generation pedigrees of herd book cows:__entity__ in Bavarian Simmental were analyzed for obligate carriers .
We considered all cows:__entity__ that were alive in June 2007 and included in the herd book .
All animals were bred by the use of artificial insemination .
Statistical analyses
The non parametric Mann - Whitney - Test was performed using SPSS Version 14 . 0 , the Chi - square test was performed using R 2 . 4 . 0 [ 14 ] .

Suggestions Concerning the Use of the Subclavian which Arises from the Aorta in the Treatment of the Tetralogy of Fallot *
Abstract

SUGGESTIONS CONCERNING THE USE OF THE SUBCLAVIAN
WHICH ARISES FROM THE AORTA IN THE TREATMENT
OF THE TETRALOGY OF FALLOT *
HARRIS B .
SHUMACKER , JR . * *
In Blalock ' s early experience with the operative treatment of the tetralogy of Fallot , the two subclavian , the innominate , and carotid arteries were all used for anastomosis to the pulmonary artery .
Soon , however , it became evident that use of the innominate or carotid was followed by a relatively high incidence of complications resulting from cerebral ischemia .
Blalock suggested , therefore , that the subclavian be used by preference .
The subclavian branch of the innominate does not become kinked or badly angulated when it is turned down for the anastomosis , and a good functional result almost invariably follows the completion of a satisfactory anastomosis .
The subclavian which arises directly from the aorta , on the other hand , tends to form a bad angle when it is brought down for the anastomosis , and , indeed , near its point of origin it may be so flattened out against the relatively rigid aortic wall as to obstruct all blood flow through it .
These considerations led Blalock to recommend the use of the former except in infants:__entity__ under two years of age in whom this artery may be too small and in adults or children:__entity__ over twelve years old or five feet tall with a left aortic arch in whom it is often too short to permit a satisfactory anastomosis . 7 '
In contrast , Paine and Varco , ' Lam , 6 Holman , ' Olim , 7 and others have preferred to use the subclavian which arises from the aorta and have obtained generally excellent results .
They point out that the tendency to kinking of the artery is more a theoretical than a practical disadvantage , that the exposure and dissection of both the pulmonary artery and the subclavian are easier on the side of the aortic arch , that both vessels are generally longer than on the opposite side and that , as a general rule , the anastomosis can be accomplished more readily .
The practical usefulness of a third systemic vessel , namely the aorta , was demonstrated by the development of a technique for side - to - side aortic pulmonary anastomosis by Potts and his associates . " 0 In spite of the preferences held by individual operators for use of one vessel or another , the fact remains , as Blalock has emphasized , that there is always present a usable systemic vessel provided a suitable pulmonary artery is available .
Nevertheless , the choice of the systemic artery in each individual patient:__entity__ is important since in certain cases one or another is unsuitable .

TREATMENT OF TETRALOGY OF FALLOT
It has been my custom to follow a policy rather similar to that outlined by Blalock .
The subclavian branch of the innominate has generally been preferred in patients:__entity__ ranging between two and twelve years of age and in older individuals in whom there is a right aortic arch .
In others the thoracotomy is usually made on the side of the aortic arch , and either the aorta itself or the subclavian arising from the aorta is used for the anastomosis .
My experience with the use of the subclavian originating from the aorta is small and the results have not been as good as those which others have reported .
One eighteen - month - old child:__entity__ died the day after operation and was found at post - mortem examination to have an occluded anastomosis .
In one three - year - old child:__entity__ and one twenty - year - old woman:__entity__ a poor result was obtained and a second operation upon the other side was necessary .
In two additional cases the result was only fair .
Excluding the patients:__entity__ mentioned in the present report , only in two was an unquestionably good result obtained .
Recently , in several cases in which failure seemed evident a modification has been required in order to obtain a functioning shunt .
Since these modifications proved successful and since these threats of failure tax one ' s ingenuiity at the time of operation , I have thought it might be helpful to describe the procedures employed and to illustrate them with case reports .
One is a method which obviously has very limited applicability , while the otlher would seem to be rather generally applicable .
The first consists of the transplantation of the origin of the subclavian to a more suitable portion of the aorta .
Case report
The patient:__entity__ was a 19 - year - old girl:__entity__ who had been cyanotic since the age of six months .
She had developed normally but was always limited in exercise capacity .
In her early years of school she was taken to school by her parents and carried to and from her seat in the classroom .
She did reasonably well in high school , being driven to and from the school , but she got into severe difficulty when she attempted to attend college .
The longer distances between classes and the necessity for climbing stairs precipitated a downhill course , with increasing dyspnea , more marked cyanosis and fatigue , and the onset of bouts of loss of consciousness .
The latter occurred several times daily .
One which was witnessed by her physician lasted 45 minutes ; he feared it would prove fatal .
Ordinarily , she could not walk more than half a block .
There was marked cyanosis of the nails and mucous membranes and to a lesser extent of the skin .
Clubbing was very prominent .
All the results of physical and laboratory examination fitted in with a diagnosis of tetralogy of Fallot .
The hematocrit ranged between 83 and 90 .
Oxygen saturation of arterial blood was 65 per cent at complete rest .
The aortic arch was on the left side .
On October 26 , 1949 a left lateral thoracotomy was performed , the pleural cavity being entered through the bed of the fifth rib .
There was evident greatly increased collateral circulation in the mediastinum and hilum .
The pulmonary artery appeared to have markedly reduced blood flow , was very short , small , and thin - walled .
Its diameter was less than 5 mm .
The aorta seemed to be bowed out laterally in an unusual fashion and the short pulmonary artery could not possibly be brought out over it .
The subclavian artery was relatively small , having
487
YALE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
a diameter of only about 4 mm . but it seemed rather long .
It was apparent that a Pott ' s procedure was impossible and that an end - to - side subclavian pulmonary artery anastomosis would be doomed to failure .
Hence , the subclavian artery was divided at the level of its first branch , the pulmonary artery was divided proximally , and an end - to - end subclavian - pulmonary anastomosis was carried out .
This was done with ease .
When the clamps were removed , however , no blood flowed through it .
The softwalled subclavian was completely flattened out against the relatively rigid aorta ( Fig . 1 ) .
When the hilar structures were forcibly elevated in a cephalad direction the subclavian immediately filled and pulsated normally and a thrill could be felt .
Simple expansion of the lungs , however , failed to achieve this result and I could conceive of no way in which the hilar region could be held in a more cephalad direction .
The subclavian was then ligated at the point where it came off the aorta and its proximal end was anastomosed end - to - side to the descending aorta .
It now pulsated vigorously as did the pulmonary artery .
In spite of the good pulsation no thrill was palpable .
The patient:__entity__ had an uneventful but disappointing convalescence .
She remained markedly cyanotic and no continuous bruit was audible .
When she left the hospital 14 days after operation there was no improvement in her appearance , hematocrit , or arterial oxygen saturation .
Surprisingly enough she reported progress on each follow - up examination .
By the end of seven weeks she was obviously less cyanotic , her hematocrit was 77 , and she was able to walk a number of blocks and to climb a flight of stairs without difficulty .
She reported that she had danced and roller - skated without much trouble .
Shortly thereafter a continuous murmur was audible in the left chest .
She continued to improve and in January entered a southern college .
She did well .
At least once a day , often twice , she walked without difficulty from the campus into town and back , a distance of ten blocks each way .
She played a little tennis , learned to swim , and began to dance , including jitterbugging .
When she xvas seen in June , her color was good , although there was still slight cyanosis of lips and nail beds .
There was a very loud , continuous murmur in the left chest .
The following fall she transferred to a midwestern university .
She got along reasonably well but not as well as she had in a warmer climate and on more level terrain .
She walked four or five blocks up and down hills between classes without difficulty in good weather but complained of some dyspnea and fatigue on cold , windy days .
She attended dances and often danced each number throughout the evening without trouble .
When seen in December she looked well .
Her color was good and clubbing was definitely less marked than it had been previously .
She had a severe cold at the time .
Her oxygen saturation of arterial blood was 75 per cent at rest and it did not fall when she stood or still - walked .
The hematocrit was 69 .
There was audible the same loud continuous murmur in the left chest .
Though the patient:__entity__ has been markedly improved , it is recognized that the result is not as good as is commonly obtained when patients:__entity__ with more adequate pulmonary arteries are treated by the conventional anastomosis of a systemic artery to the side of the pulmonary artery .
Nevertheless , the patient:__entity__ has thus far been given such good health and relatively normal capacity for ordinary activity that further operation has seemed unwarranted , though the possibility of some future attempt at creation of an additional shunt is being kept in mind .
The second procedure embodies the cephalad transplantation of the pulmonary artery by a plastic repair of the incision in the hilar and mediastinal pleural structures .

TREATMENT OF TETRALOGY OF FALLOT
Case reports
The first patient:__entity__ was a fully grown young man:__entity__ of 17 with tetralogy of Fallot which caused considerable incapacity .
He was admitted to the hospital on July 18 , 1950 and was operated upon two days later .
He was known to have a left aortic arch , and a left lateral thoracotomy was performed .
The aorta was freed for a side - to - side anastomosis with the pulmonary artery .
So much difficulty was encountered , however , in placing the aortic clamp in proper position for making a satisfactory incision in the aorta that the procedure was abandoned and an end - to - side subclavian - pulmonary artery anastomosis accomplished instead .
The pulmonary artery was of fair size , having an estimated diameter of 1 cm .
The subclavian artery appeared to be quite long and it was of very satisfactory size , having a diameter of about 6 mm .
To my dismay , the first portion of the soft - walled subclavian artery was completely flattened out against the rather rigid wall of the aorta and no blood flow through it could be demonstrated , there being no subclavian pulsation nor thrill in the pulmonary artery .
If one forcefully elevated the hilum of the lung in a cephalad direction , the obstruction disappeared , the subclavian artery began to pulsate , and a thrill could be palpated .
When the lung was allowed to assume its usual position , the subclavian obstruction was again evident and could not be prevented by full expansion of the lung .
It was found that the hilar region and the pulmonary artery could be maintained in a satisfactory cephalad position by traction upward upon the cuff of hilar pleura and the adjacent vascular sheath and that these structures were sufficiently strong so that traction could be maintained upon them with a small hemostat .
The defect in the mediastinal and hilar tissues was then repaired using a sort of inverted T - plastic closure .
By this maneuver success was achieved in elevating the pulmonary artery in a cephalad direction so that the subclavian obstruction was relieved and excellent pulsation was evident ( Fig . 2B ) .
A fairly good continuous thrill was palpable .
The patient:__entity__ had an uneventful convalescence .
When last seen on January 16 , 1951 he had excellent color without any visible cyanosis .
The clubbing seemed to have decreased somewhat .
A continuous murmur was audible .
He stated that he noted no limitation of exercise capacity .
In outlining his activities he said that , among other things , he was doing a great deal of ice - skating and was playing ice hockey regularly .
He was planning to start college work the following month .
The second patient:__entity__ was a 16 - year - old boy:__entity__ who had been cyanotic since birth .
His physical development was somewhat retarded and he was slow in learning to sit and walk .
Until he had grown old enough to be self - conscious about it he had always squatted when he was tired .
By perseverance he had managed to do more than one would have suspected he could from the degree of his cyanosis .
He could walk as much as five or six blocks at a slow pace .
He was fond of drums and managed to play occasionally with an orchestra in a somewhat restricted fashion .
For the past few months he had had more dyspnea , fatigability , and seemed to be going downhill generally .
The results of physical and laboratory studies were rather typical of the tetralogy of Fallot .
Clubbing was marked , the nailbeds and mucous membranes were a rather deep purplish - blue color , and the skin had a dusky cyanotic tint .
The aortic arch was determined to be on the left .
On July 21 , 1950 a left lateral thoracotomy was performed , the pleural cavity being entered through the bed of the fourth rib .
There was a rather marked increase in the collateral circulation in the mediastinum and the hilar region .
The pulmonary artery was easily dissected free .
It was fairly long and was about 1 cm . in diameter .
The subclavian artery seemed quite long and was of adequate size , having a diameter of about 5 mm .
An end - to - side sub9lavian pulmonary anastomosis was performed .
Again in this case , however , the first part of the subclavian was acutely angulated and completely flattened out against the aortic wall .
There was no
489
YALE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
pulsation in the subclavian and no thrill in the pulmonary .
In this instance also , good blood flow through the subclavian artery was evident whenever the hilar structures were elevated in a cephalad direction but no pulsation was demonstrable simply by expanding fully the lung .
Again , a sort of inverted T - plastic closure of the defect in the hilum and mediastinum brought about a cephalad elevation of the pulmonary artery so that tension was released and there was excellent pulsation in the subclavian artery .
A thrill was now palpable .
Convalescence was uneventful .
Improvement in color was evident within a few days and his color was excellent by the time he was discharged from the hospital on the thirteenth postoperative day .
He rapidly found that he was now able to lead a quite normal sort of life .
When he was seen on December 9 he stated that he had no limitation in exercise capacity .
He could walk rapidly without fatigue .
He was going to school and was playing the drums in a professional orchestra three or four nights each week .
There was some diminution in the clubbing and his color was excellent .
There was a loud continuous bruit audible in the chest .
On March 27 the arterial oxygen saturation was 88 . 2 per cent .
When I first used this procedure I was rather surprised that such tissues would hold sutures and serve satisfactorily to elevate the hilum .
On occasions I had previously toyed with the idea of suturing hilar pleura to the mediastinal pleura but had abandoned it as impractical because the sutures seemed to pull out whenever there was any tension whatsoever .
If the procedure is to be successful , it is essential that the sutures encompass any adjacent areolar and fibrous tissue and especially the so - called vascular sheath which surrounds both pulmonary artery and aorta and is dissected free during the course of the operation .
Fortunately , in its proximal portion the sheath about the pulmonary artery gains added strength from the extension into it of a reflection of the fibrous pericardium .
Sutures through the mediastinal pleura in the region of the aortic arch purposely include the perivascular tissues which have been stripped off the aorta and subclavian artery and also any other available tissue which may lend strength , such as the divided ends of the supreme intercostal vein or other vessels which lhave been transected and ligated .
The exact method of repair will vary from case to case .
By placing the sutures properly it would seem possible sometimes to displace the pulmonary artery laterally as well as in a cephalad direction if such a maneuver was thought to be desirable ( Fig . 2C ) .
On occasions one would close the pleural defect fairly snugly , on others leave it wide open in places .
Discussion
Though there is always available some suitable systemic vessel and though the major concern in the operative treatment of the tetralogy of Fallot is the adequacy of the pulmonary artery , from time to time one may find the achievement of a satisfactory result thwarted by the local anatomical characteristics regardless of one ' s choice of procedure .
Consequently , those modifications which may add to the likelihood of a successful outcome are important .
Blalock " ' pointed out the practicability of performing an end - toend subclavian - pulmonary artery anastomosis whenever the pulmonary artery is judged too small or the subclavian too short for a satisfactory end
490
TREATMENT OF TETRALOGY OF FALLOT 491
to - side anastomosis .
Holman ' feels that a poorly functioning shunt after end - to - side anastomosis can usually be corrected by proximal division of the subclavian artery , thus in effect converting the procedure into an end - to - end anastomosis .
If a satisfactory end - to - side suture of subclavian and pulmonary arteries or side - to - side aortic pulmonary anastomosis seems difficult to achieve , one may occasionally find it useful to divide the upper lobe branch of the pulmonary artery and carry out an end - to - end suture of the subclavian and the proximal end of the upper lobe branch .
Potts and Smith ' performed an anastomosis between the proximal end of the upper lobe branch and the side of the aorta in a case in which complete temporary occlusion of the main pulmonary artery was withstood poorly .
I have found this principle of division of the upper lobe branch and use of its proximal end of value in obtaining a suitable subclavian pulmonary anastomosis when the subclavian seemed to have inadequate length .
On occasions when the systemic vessel seems too short , one may elect to interpose a free vascular transplant , 3 " ' a modification I first employed in 1946 though unfortunately not with success in this instance .
The operation performed in my first patient:__entity__ constitutes in reality the use of the subclavian artery as an autogenous graft between the aorta and pulmonary artery .
It will obviously not often be the procedure of choice but sometimes may be found a useful measure in converting an apparently inadequate functional shunt into a good one .
If my initial experiences with the plastic repair of the defect in the mediastinal and hilar structures are characteristic of what may be expected of this procedure , it would seem to have wide applicability whenever a poorly functioning subclavian - pulmonary shunt seems correctable by cephalad transplantation of the hilar structures and the consequent release of tension .
I was unaware of any reference in the literature to its use until belatedly I discovered that I had overlooked a statement in the legend of one of the excellent drawings in Blalock ' s paper on surgical procedures in pulmonic stenosis . ' Here he states that suture of the pleura of the superior aspect of the hilum to the mediastinal pleura may effectively elevate a little the pulmonary artery .
Perhaps our more detailed consideration of this maneuver may add to its general usefulness .

Tissue remodeling : a mating - induced differentiation program for the Drosophila:__entity__ oviduct
Abstract
Background
In both vertebrates and invertebrates , the oviduct is an epithelial tube surrounded by visceral muscles that serves as a conduit for gamete transport between the ovary and uterus .
While Drosophila is a model system for tubular organ development , few studies have addressed the development of the fly:__entity__ ' s oviduct .
Recent studies in Drosophila have identified mating - responsive genes and proteins whose levels in the oviduct are altered by mating .
Since many of these molecules ( e . g . Muscle LIM protein 84B , Coracle , Neuroglian ) have known roles in the differentiation of muscle and epithelia of other organs , mating may trigger similar differentiation events in the oviduct .
This led us to hypothesize that mating mediates the last stages of oviduct differentiation in which organ - specific specializations arise .
Results
Using electron - and confocal - microscopy we identified tissue - wide post - mating changes in the oviduct including differentiation of cellular junctions , remodeling of extracellular matrix , increased myofibril formation , and increased innervation .
Analysis of once - and twice - mated females reveals that some mating - responsive proteins respond only to the first mating , while others respond to both matings .
Conclusion
We uncovered ultrastructural changes in the mated oviduct that are consistent with the roles that mating - responsive proteins play in muscle and epithelial differentiation elsewhere .
This suggests that mating triggers the late differentiation of the oviduct .
Furthermore , we suggest that mating - responsive proteins that respond only to the first mating are involved in the final maturation of the oviduct while proteins that remain responsive to later matings are also involved in maintenance and ongoing function of the oviduct .
Taken together , our results establish the oviduct as an attractive system to address mechanisms that regulate the late stages of differentiation and maintenance of a tubular organ .
Background
Most internal organs , including the vascular and respiratory systems and the gastro - intestinal and urinary - genital tracts are comprised of a single epithelial tube or a network of tubes .
Tubular organs serve as conduits for the transport of gases , liquids , or solutes , and serve as barriers between biological compartments .
To create tubes with specific flow and barrier properties , the morphology of the tube must be precisely specified during development and modulated by physiology .
To accommodate specific physiological roles , tissue - specific programs for differentiation are employed at the last stages of development .
While much is known about the molecular and cellular basis of tube formation [ 1 - 6 ] , little is known about the mechanisms that regulate the late stages of differentiation in which organ - specific specializations arise .
The conservation of genes and similarity in tubular organ design across taxa make Drosophila an excellent model for understanding organogenesis in higher animals .
In Drosophila , the best understood tubular organs from a developmental point of view are the trachea and salivary gland .
Studies of these organs reveal a general program for tubular organ development , in which combinatorial expression of global patterning genes specifies positions within the embryo for the subsequent activation of tissue - specific early genes and transcription factors .
This program results in the activation of downstream genes involved in terminal differentiation of organ - specific specializations such as the cuticle that lines the tracheal lumen [ 1 , 2 , 4 , 7 - 9 ] .
The Drosophila:__entity__ female reproductive tract is another tubular system , consisting of the uterus and a common oviduct ( the main tube ) that branches into two lateral oviducts .
Regional differences in function are observed along the length of the tract , with egg activation occurring largely at the proximal end , in the lateral oviducts , and fertilization occurring at the distal end , in the uterus [ 10 , 11 ] .
Unlike other tubular organs , little is known about the development of the female reproductive tract .
However , regional differences in function suggest the presence of region - specific differentiation programs within the female reproductive tract .
In Drosophila , mating induces changes in female behavior and physiology via molecules transmitted in the seminal fluid .
These changes are rapid and lead to a mated female state which is profoundly different from the unmated female state .
While an unmated female lays few eggs and readily accepts the courtship efforts of a male , a mated female exhibits increased egg - laying and actively rejects males [ 12 - 19 ] .
Microarray studies of whole flies:__entity__ reveal that the changes in egg - laying rate are accompanied by a change in gene expression .
Within three hours of mating there is an increase in expression of a small number of genes [ 20 , 21 ] .
Rapid changes in gene expression , as well as protein abundance , have also been observed in the female reproductive tract [ 22 , 23 ] .
In the upper reproductive tract ( lateral and common oviducts , hereafter , oviduct ) , mating induces an increase in immune related transcripts and down regulates transcription factors involved in cell growth and differentiation .
At the protein level mating induces increased abundance of proteins associated with muscle assembly and function and cytoskeletal proteins associated with epithelial morphogenesis [ 23 ] .
Since many of these mating - responsive proteins act in late differentiation pathways of muscle and epithelia elsewhere ( e . g . Bent , Muscle LIM protein 84B ( Mlp84B ) , Neuroglian ( Nrg ) , Coracle ( Cora ) ) , we hypothesize that mating triggers similar differentiation in the oviduct .
To test our hypothesis we characterized the ultrastructure of oviduct epithelia and muscle , as well as the pattern of innervation before and after mating .
We then examined the effect of different mating regimes on oviduct mating - responsive cytoskeletal proteins and on female reproductive output .
Our results suggest that active tissue remodeling takes place in the oviduct epithelia and musculature in response to mating .
Furthermore , we found a striking increase in innervation of the oviduct after mating .
Our results show that the reproductive tract is an attractive system to address mechanisms that regulate the late stages of tissue differentiation in a tubular organ .
Unlike other tubular organs , the last differentiation stage of the oviduct is triggered by an extrinsic cue ( mating ) .
This makes it possible to experimentally control the onset of differentiation , with an opportunity to independently examine the effects of mating and age .
In addition , it allows us to examine processes essential for reproduction .

Mating induces changes in oviduct lumen
Our previous molecular profiling showed that mating promotes changes in actin - based cytoskeletal molecules and suggests that mating triggers molecular changes and tissue remodeling in the female reproductive tract that mediate its progression to a mature functional stage [ 23 ] .
To gain insight into the mechanisms that underlie this progression , we used light and electron microscopy to determine the morphological status of the oviduct in unmated and mated 3 - day old females .
In nearly all mated reproductive tracts processed for microscopy ( 8 / 9 ) , an egg was located in one of the lateral oviducts , whereas an egg was never observed in the oviduct of unmated reproductive tracts ( 5 / 5 ) ( Figure 1 ) .
This observation is consistent with previous studies that report increased ovulation and egg - laying at 6 h post - mating [ 24 ] .
In all unmated reproductive tracts examined , the region between the lateral oviducts and the middle of the common oviduct was either tapered or constricted , whereas this region appeared relaxed in the mated reproductive tract ( Figure 1A and 1D ) .
These observations raise the possibility that the lumen is narrow in the unmated oviduct and larger in the mated oviduct .
To address this possibility , we collected serial 1 mu m longitudinal sections through the reproductive tracts of unmated and mated females and stained these sections with toluidine blue to survey the appearance of the lumen along the entire length of the oviduct ( Figure 1B and 1E ) .
Our examination reveals that , in unmated reproductive tracts , the lateral oviduct lumen has an irregular shape , while the common oviduct lumen appears straight .
Moreover , in all the unmated reproductive tracts sectioned , we detected patches of darkly stained material in the lumen of the lower common oviduct .
In the mated reproductive tract , the lumen of the upper oviduct ( defined as the lateral oviduct and upper part of the common oviduct ) has an irregular shape , and the lumen of the lower oviduct ( defined as the lower part of common oviduct ) appears straight .
In addition , the lumen of the lower oviduct appears wider in mated than unmated reproductive tracts ( Figure 1C and 1F ) .
Interestingly , darkly stained material was not detected in the oviduct lumen of mated females .
This observation appears to be consistent with the description made by Mahowald et al .
[ 25 ] , who reported that the oviduct lumen of unmated females is nearly filled with an intima - like matrix and that this matrix is reduced after mating .
Because 3 - day - old mated females lay eggs , it is unclear whether the lack of lumenal material and increase in lumen size in mated females occurred before or after the passage of eggs .
We suggest that mating directly or indirectly induces morphological changes in the oviduct that facilitate egg passage through the duct .
Taken together , our observations lead us to propose that the oviduct lumen is closed and / or obstructed in the unmated reproductive tract , and that mating induces changes in the epithelia and / or muscle that " open " the oviduct lumen .
Initial formation of cell - cell junctions in oviduct epithelia is mating - independent
To determine whether mating induces specific morphological changes in the oviduct epithelia post - mating , we next examined the ultrastructure of the oviduct epithelia in unmated and mated reproductive tracts .
Since molecular profiling demonstrates that proteins associated with cellular junctions such as alpha - and beta - Spectrin ( Spec ) , Cora , and Nrg [ 23 ] increase post - mating , we first determined the status of the cellular junctions in the oviduct epithelia of unmated females , and whether these junctions change post - mating .
In Drosophila , most ectodermally derived epithelia ( such as the epidermis and trachea ) , with a few exceptions , are joined apically by a belt - like adherens junction called the zonal adherens junction ( ZA ) followed basally by a septate junction ( SJ ) [ 26 ] .
Our analysis reveals that the oviduct is lined , along its entire length , by a monolayered epithelium comprised of squamous - type cells .
Although region - specific differences in morphology were observed , all oviduct epithelia examined , in both unmated and mated females , are joined along their lateral membranes by an extensive SJ and lack an apical ZA ( Figure 2 ) .
SJs and ZAs form complete belts that surround the epithelial cell , thus making these junctions easily visible in transverse sections through the epithelium .
Because ZAs were not detected in our transverse sections through the oviduct , this implies that ZAs never formed , or developed earlier and were lost ( Figure 2D ) .
Interestingly , we did not detect any ultrastructural differences in the SJs at 6 h post - mating , but we did uncover differences in SJ ultrastructure in different regions of the oviduct .
Based on their ultrastructure , two types of SJs , smooth and pleated , can be distinguished in Drosophila [ 26 ] .
Smooth SJs are distinguished by the lack of visible septae and the appearance of electron dense material in the intercellular space , while pleated SJs are distinguished by the ladder - like appearance of septae .
In the lateral oviducts and upper common oviduct , septa were not detected in the SJ , thus these SJs represent smooth SJs or an immature stage of pleated SJ ( Figure 2A , 2A ' , 2A " ) .
In contrast , a ladder - like arrangement of septae was often visible in the SJs of the lower common oviduct ( Figure 2C ' ) , thus these SJs can be classified as pleated .
Unlike the smooth - like SJs of the upper oviduct , the pleated SJs of the lower oviduct are followed basally by spot type adherens junction ( spot AJs ) ( Figure 2B , 2B ' ; additional file 1 ) .
Further analysis is necessary to determine if the SJs of the upper and lower oviduct represent different types or different developmental stages .
Our findings demonstrate that the initial formation of SJs , as well as spot AJs in the lower oviduct , are mating - independent .
This raises an interesting question .
Why are SJ proteins such as Cora and Nrg up - regulated post - mating if SJs are formed prior to mating ?
It is possible that the increased expression of SJ proteins is associated with functional changes in polarized secretion post - mating .
Recent studies have shown that SJs play an unexpected role in regulating the apical secretion of specialized extracellular matrix molecules in the trachea [ 27 , 28 ] , and that these molecules are important regulators of lumen size .
Mating modulates apical secretory activity in the oviduct
Given the presence of extensive SJs in the oviduct and the role of SJs in regulating apical secretion of extracellular matrix molecules in other epithelia ( e . g . trachea ) , we asked if mating modulates apical secretion in the oviduct epithelia .
Our ultrastructural analysis reveals that different regions of the oviduct display different apical membrane morphology ( i . e microvilli or pleats ) ( see Figures 2 and additional file 2A and 2A ) , but all epithelia are covered by an electron dense apical extracellular matrix ( AECM ) and a thin layer of cuticle .
We found that mating induces ultrastructural changes in the AECM and cuticle in both the upper and lower oviduct .
In the upper oviduct of the unmated female , the AECM varies in thickness along the apical surface ( Figure 3A ) .
Some areas have little AECM , while other areas are covered by a distinct layer of AECM ( ~ 1 - 2 mu m in thickness ; Figure 3B ) .
However , the AECM of mated females is more evenly distributed along the apical surface , ( ~ 2 mu m in thickness ; Figure 3E ) .
Strikingly , the AECM and cuticle of mated females have a ruffled appearance , suggesting that the AECM and cuticle have increased in surface area ( Figure 3F ) .
Electron dense granules up to ~ 1 . 5 mu m in diameter were occasionally observed in both the AECM and cell cytoplasm ( Figure 3F ) .
Although further analysis is needed to determine the role of these granules in the oviduct epithelia , it is possible that these granules participate in the secretion and deposition of the AECM .
Taken together , our findings suggest that polarized secretion via the AECM , while ongoing in the upper oviduct of the unmated female is enhanced and / or modulated post - mating .
Post - mating changes in AECM ultrastructure are also observed in the lower common oviduct .
However , unlike the AECM of the upper oviduct , the AECM of the lower oviduct is well developed prior to mating .
In the lower oviduct of the unmated female , the AECM consists of an amorphous electron dense material and is unevenly distributed , forming a thick , bulbous layer above the plasma membrane in some regions ( additional file 2 ) .
Matrix - like material is also observed in the lumen , but this material is more electron dense than the AECM ( additional file 2A and 2A ) .
In the mated female , the AECM is flattened against the plasma membrane and is uniformly distributed along the apical surface ( additional file 2B and 2B ) .
Matrix - like material was not observed in the center of the lumen , but small pools of very electron dense material were detected in the spaces between the epithelial folds ( additional file 2C and 2C ) .
This may explain why lumenal matrix was not detected at the light microscopic level in the mated female oviduct ( see Figure 1E and 1F ) .
Taken together , our observations suggest that the lower common oviduct is a site of active apical secretion in both mated and unmated females , and that matrix secretion , particularly in the lumen , is reduced post - mating .
These findings raise the intriguing possibility that the AECM and lumenal matrix function as a plug in the lower oviduct , and that mating induces the breakdown of this plug .
Mating induces changes in hemi - adherens junctions in upper oviduct
In addition to modulating secretion at the apical membrane , mating induces changes at the basolateral membrane .
In many epithelia , one of the last steps of differentiation is the development of a layer of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) called the basal lamina that covers the apical and / or basal membranes and the concomitant development of hemi - adherens junctions ( HAJs ) .
HAJs connect the cell cytoskeleton with the ECM and are formed at virtually all cell surfaces that contact an ECM .
HAJs can be distinguished at the ultrastructural level as a patch - like , electron dense undercoat of the plasma membrane that opposes the basal lamina ( [ 26 ] ; Figure 3G , 3H ) .
In the Drosophila:__entity__ embryo , the HAJs and basal lamina are formed at the same time [ 26 ] .
Because the basal lamina is established at a time when the majority of extracellular matrix molecules are actively secreted [ 26 , 29 ] , this suggests that the formation of HAJs is tightly coordinated with the secretion of the ECM .
One of the most striking post - mating changes observed in the oviduct epithelia was the appearance of numerous HAJs along the basolateral membrane in the upper oviduct ( Figure 3 ) .
The importance of HAJs , particularly in the upper oviduct , is underscored by the extensive infolding of the basolateral membrane that is observed in both unmated and mated females ( Figure 3A and 3E ) .
The infolded membrane gives rise to a highly branched intercellular space that is filled with an ECM ( Figure 3C and 3G ) .
This ECM is contiguous with the basal lamina that surrounds the epithelia .
Few HAJs were observed in the upper oviduct of the unmated female , and these were largely restricted to the basal membrane , and not observed along the basolateral infolding ( Figure 3C ) .
In contrast , numerous HAJs appear along the basolateral infolding post - mating in this region of the oviduct ( Figure 3F - 3H ) .
In addition , the intercellular space appears wider post - mating ( Figure 3C - 3D and 3G - 3H ) , suggesting that mating induces increased secretion and / or deposition of the ECM in this cellular compartment and brings the ECM to a threshold concentration that can support the development of HAJs .
HAJs were also detected along the basal membrane , but they were not detected along the apical membrane even though this membrane was covered by an ECM .
Interestingly , while the basolateral membrane forms very shallow folds in the lower oviduct ( see additional file 2 ) , HAJs were observed along this membrane in unmated reproductive tracts ( data not shown ) , thus suggesting that the epithelia is more differentiated in this region of the oviduct , and that the differentiation of the upper and lower oviduct may be under different control .
Muscle differentiation is enhanced post - mating
While we uncovered post - mating changes in the oviduct epithelia that might facilitate its transition to a high egg - laying state , this transition may also be mediated by changes in oviduct muscle properties and / or activity .
The oviduct is lined by circular muscle fibers with supercontractile characteristics [ 30 ] .
Our previous studies showed that mef2 and mlp84B genes that regulate muscle differentiation , are expressed and increased post - mating in the oviduct , as well as in the sperm storage regions of the reproductive tract [ 22 , 23 ] .
This suggests that mating induces muscle differentiation in the reproductive tract .
Muscle differentiation is characterized by the assembly of myofilaments into bundles called myofibrils .
As muscles differentiate , myofibrils and z - bodies appear simultaneously , and increase in number until the cytoplasm is filled with myofibrils [ 31 ] .
Like epithelia , one of the last steps of muscle differentiation is the secretion of a basal lamina that surrounds the muscle fiber .
To determine if mating induces structural changes in muscles ( such as increased myofibrils ) we examined the ultrastructure of muscle fibers in the upper and lower parts of the oviduct .
Our analysis revealed that , in both unmated and mated reproductive tracts , the muscles of the lower oviduct are highly differentiated as evidenced by the high density of myofibrils , well developed and aligned z - bodies , and secretion of a thick , electron dense basal lamina ( Figure 4E and 4F ) .
In contrast , muscle fibers in the lateral oviducts and upper common oviduct appear less differentiated than muscles in the lower common oviduct , as evidenced by the lesser density of myofibrils and z - bodies , and little or no basal lamina ( Figure 4A and 4B ) .
Moreover , the muscles of the upper oviduct appear more differentiated in the mated than in unmated reproductive tracts ( Figure 4A - 4D ) .
Interestingly , we observed neighboring muscle fibers in different states of differentiation in the lateral oviducts in both unmated and mated reproductive tracts , but not elsewhere in the oviduct ( Figure 4B ) .
These results suggest that mating enhances the rate of muscle differentiation in the upper oviduct , and that muscle differentiation is delayed in the upper as compared to the lower oviduct .
The increased muscle differentiation in the upper oviduct is not dramatic and likely reflects the short post - mating period examined in this study .
The delayed differentiation of the upper oviduct muscles resembles the delay in the onset of development between the adult thoracic muscles and abdominal muscles during metamorphosis [ 32 ] .
Since the ovaries and the other parts of the reproductive tract are known to have different segmental origins [ 33 ] , we hypothesize that different parts of the oviduct develop at different rates or begin development at different times .
Increased innervation in the oviduct post - mating
Nerve - muscle interactions play an important role in regulating adult muscle development and refining the final pattern of innervation [ 34 , 35 ] .
Given that oviduct muscle differentiation is enhanced post - mating , we predicted that mating either directly or indirectly induces changes in innervation .
To address this prediction , we quantified the number of nerve terminals or boutons innervating the lateral oviducts and common oviduct in unmated and mated reproductive tracts .
Studies of oviduct innervation in Drosophila reveal that the fly:__entity__ ' s oviduct receives aminergic , peptidergic and glutamatergic input [ 30 , 36 - 39 ] .
In both larval and adult Drosophila , different types of boutons are formed by neurons that express different neurotransmitters and modulators [ 40 - 42 ] .
By similarity to the boutons described at the larval and adult neuromuscular junction , Middleton et al .
[ 30 ] report that the fly:__entity__ ' s oviduct is innervated by glutamatergic type I boutons and tyraminergic / octopaminergic type II boutons .
Rodgriguez - Valentin et al .
[ 43 ] further report that the oviduct type II boutons co - express octopamine and glutamate .
The neurons that give rise to the type I innervation have not been identified .
However , it is well established that type II innervation arises from octopaminergic neurons located in the abdominal ganglion [ 30 , 43 ] .
In addition , it has been shown that some or all of these neurons express a GAL4 insertion line for the bullwinkle ( bwk ) gene [ 43 ] .
Bwk encodes a HMG - box containing putative transcription factor [ 44 ] .
To determine if mating induces any changes in the number of type I and II boutons innervating the oviduct muscles , we used the pan - neural marker , anti - HRP to label all oviduct boutons in unmated and mated females .
To distinguish between type I and II boutons we used an antibody against the Disc Large ( DLG ) protein [ 45 ] .
Type I boutons were identified by their DLG postsynaptic staining and large size ( > 8 mu m in diameter ) ( Figure 4G ) , while type II boutons were distinguished by their absence of DLG staining and smaller size ( < 2 mu m ) ( Figure 4H ) .
We find that type I and II boutons innervate the lateral oviducts and common oviduct , and that the type I innervation is restricted to a few axons that run parallel to the length of the oviduct , while the type II innervation is more widespread .
We quantified the number of boutons in the lateral oviducts and common oviduct and observed a 74 % increase in bouton number in the lateral oviduct and a 66 % increase in the common oviduct post - mating ( Figure 4I ) .
More over , we observed no significant change in the number of type I boutons in the lateral oviduct and common oviduct .
However , we detected a 1 . 5 - fold increase in the number of type II boutons in the lateral oviduct and a 1 . 8 - fold increase in type II innervation in the common oviduct .
Dramatic increases in bouton growth are also observed during development .
For example , a ten - fold increase in bouton number is observed at the neuromuscular junction during the larval period [ 46 ] .
To determine if the increase in type II innervation was specific to mating or reflected normal growth in 3 day - old females , we quantified type I and II innervation in the oviducts of 5 day - old unmated females .
We found no significant difference in type I and II innervation in unmated 3 day - old and 5 - day - old females , indicating that mating , either directly or indirectly , induces a dramatic increase in type II innervation ( Figure 4I ) .
To determine if the post - mating increase in innervation is unique to the oviduct , we asked if mating induces a global change in innervation .
We quantified bouton number in the adult ventral midline muscles of the 5th abdominal segment .
These muscles are innervated by boutons that increase in number during metamorphosis [ 47 ] .
No significant difference in bouton number was detected at these muscles in unmated and mated females ( additional file 3 ) .
Though further analysis is needed , this suggests that the post - mating increase in innervation is oviduct - specific .
Because the type II boutons are octopaminergic , the increased type II innervation may result in increased octopamine ( OA ) release in the oviduct .
In support of this possibility , we have preliminary evidence that OA is released in the oviduct post - mating ( Heifetz and Wolfner , in preparation ) .
Studies in locust and Drosophila demonstrate that OA inhibits oviduct contraction , while glutamate activates oviduct contraction [ 30 , 43 , 48 ] .
In Drosophila , electrical stimulation of the posterior abdominal nerve gives rise to a series of muscle contractions in the oviduct followed by a period of muscle fatigue or relaxation [ 43 ] .
This pattern of muscle contraction and relaxation may facilitate the proper movement of the egg through the oviduct .
In their study of bwk expressing neurons that innervate the oviduct , Rodriguez - Valentin et al .
[ 43 ] show that OA and glutamate interact to produce the pattern of oviduct contraction and relaxation described above .
It is therefore possible that the post - mating increase in type II innervation in the oviduct plays an important role in the increased rate of ovulation and egg - laying observed post - mating .
Female mating history affects the enrichment of cytosekeletal proteins in the oviduct
To gain insights into the role of cytoskeletal protein enrichment ( [ 23 ] ; additional file 4 ) in mediating the morphological changes detected in this study , we examined the effect of different mating regimes on cytoskeletal protein abundance .
We focused on a subset of mating - responsive cytoskeletal proteins with well established roles in the differentiation of muscle and epithelia .
These include : ( i ) Mlp84B which regulates the late differentiation pathway of muscle [ 49 ] ; ( ii ) Cora and Nrg which are required for the formation of septate junctions in epithelia [ 50 ] , and ( iii ) Hu - li tai shao ( Hts ) , also known as adducin - like protein , which functions in assembly of the cytoskeletal network .
Na + pump alpha subunit ( ATP alpha ) , another protein associated with septate junctions in epithelia , is not a mating - responsive protein and was used as a control .
Using western blots , we first determined the abundance of the cytoskeletal proteins in oviducts of 3 - day - old unmated and mated females at 6 hrs post - mating .
We confirmed the proteomic results of Kalpenikov et al .
[ 23 ] and found that mating increases the abundance of all proteins , except ATP alpha in mated oviducts relative to their abundance in unmated oviducts ( Figure 5A ) .
To determine whether the increased abundance of mating - responsive proteins persists for longer times post - mating , we examined oviducts of 10 - day - old females that mated once at 3 days of age , and calculated the abundance of the mating - responsive proteins relative to their level in oviducts of 3 - day - old unmated females .
We found no change or a slight increase in the relative abundance of all cytoskeletal proteins except Mlp84B at 7 days post - mating ( Figure 5A ) .
Strikingly , the level of Mlp84B declines by 7 days post - mating to the level observed prior to mating .
Thus Mlp84B levels rise and fall after mating , while the epithelial - related proteins rapidly rise and are maintained at a high level after mating .
This raises the possibility that a second mating might trigger an increase in Mlp84B protein expression as observed in 3 - day - old females at 6 h post - mating .
To test this possibility , females were mated twice ( once at day 3 , and once on day 10 of age ) , and their oviducts were examined at 6 hrs after the second mating .
We calculated the abundance of the cytoskeletal proteins in the twice mated oviducts relative to their abundance in oviducts of 3 - day - old unmated females .
Our results show that a second mating has little or no effect on Mlp84B abundance .
Thus , Mlp84B may represent a class of mating - responsive proteins that is only needed after the first mating .
Interestingly , the effect of the second mating on the epithelial - related mating - responsive proteins appears to be different for each protein .
While Cora levels drop to the level observed in 3 - day - old unmated females , Nrg and Hts are maintained at a high level .
To determine if the changes in cytoskeletal protein abundance are mating - dependent we measured their abundance in the oviducts of unmated 5 - and 10 - day - old females .
We calculated their abundance relative to their level in oviducts of unmated 3 - day - old females ( Figure 5B ) .
We rationalized that if the change in cytoskeletal protein abundance is mating - dependent we will not see similar changes in unmated females .
We observed a slow increase in the relative abundance of all mating - responsive proteins with time post - eclosion ( Figure 5B ) .
Because unmated females lay more eggs as they age ( see additional file 5C ) one possible interpretation of the increased level of cytoskeletal proteins in unmated females is that these proteins are associated with an intrinsic program for oviduct maturation and that mating accelerates this process to maximize egg - laying efficacy .
Alternatively , it is possible that the slow increase in protein abundance observed in unmated females is due to the passage of eggs through the oviduct .
Taken together , our results suggest that mating is essential to fine - tune the levels of the mating - responsive proteins examined in this study .
Because the changes in cytoskeletal protein abundance are different in unmated and mated females , this suggests that the post - mating changes are mating - dependent .
Furthermore , we suggest that these post - mating changes are linked to changes in oviduct function .
Early or prior mating increases fecundity
In Drosophila , female fecundity decreases with age [ 51 - 54 ] .
It has been proposed that this decrease is due , in part , to the loss of germline and somatic stem cells [ 55 ] .
Since the expression of the oviduct cytoskeletal proteins examined in this study change with age and mating experience , the state of the oviduct may also play a role in fecundity .
To separate the effects of age and mating , we measured the fecundity of females that mated twice , first at 3 days post - eclosion and again at 10 days , and compared that to the fecundity of females that mated once at 3 days and females that mated once at 10 days .
Fecundity was measured as the number of eggs laid per day per female during the first three days after mating .
Once - mated 3 - day - old females laid nearly twice as many eggs as once - mated 10 - day - old females during the three days examined ( 24 . 5 +/- 0 . 7 versus 13 . 3 +/- 0 . 9 , p < 0 . 0001 ) .
Twice - mated 10 - day - old females also laid about 50 % more eggs than once - mated females of the same age ( 19 . 3 +/- 0 . 9 versus 13 . 3 +/- 0 . 9 , p < 0 . 0001 ) , but about 20 % fewer than laid by once - mated 3 - day - old females during the three days examined ( 19 . 3 +/- 0 . 9 versus 24 . 5 +/- 0 . 7 , p < 0 . 0001 ) ( Figure 6A , see also additional file 5A and 5B ) .
Thus , the difference in fecundity between once - mated 10 - day - old and once - mated 3 - day - old females is not a result of age alone .
Rather the main determinant of fecundity at 10 days is whether there had been a prior mating at 3 days .
We also calculated the fertility ( number of adults eclosed ) of once - and twice - mated females .
Once - mated 3 - day - old females are more fertile than once - mated 10 - day - old females ( 69 . 5 +/- 1 . 6 % versus 56 . 1 +/- 3 . 0 % , p < 0 . 0001 ) and slightly more fertile than twice - mated 10 - day - old females ( 69 . 5 +/- 1 . 6 % versus 62 . 7 +/- 2 . 4 % , p < 0 . 015 ) ( Figure 6B , see also additional file 5D ) .
Because there is no significant difference in fertility between once - mated and twice - mated 10 - day - old females , this suggests that ( 1 ) a prior mating has no significant effect on the fertility of 10 - day - old mated females and ( 2 ) fertility decreases with age .
One intriguing interpretation of these results is that an early mating increases fecundity which partially compensates for the age - related decrease in fertility .
Thus , cytoskeletal mating - responsive protein changes may be associated with structural changes in the oviduct that result in increased fecundity .
This may counteract the effects of decreased fertility on the reproductive output .
Discussion
Despite the use of Drosophila as a model system for organ - level biology and the emerging parallels between mammalian and Drosophila:__entity__ reproductive biology [ 56 ] , this is the first integrative tissue - wide study of post - mating changes in the Drosophila:__entity__ oviduct .
Our results provide several lines of evidence at the molecular , morphological and physiological levels suggesting that mating induces tissue - wide differentiation in the oviduct .
Moreover , we identify ultrastructural changes in the mated oviduct that are consistent with the roles that some of the mating - responsive proteins examined in this study ( e . g . Mlp84B , Cora , Nrg ) are reported to play in muscle and epithelial differentiation elsewhere .
For example , the increased abundance of Mlp84B , a major regulator of the late differentiation pathway of muscle [ 49 ] is consistent with the increased muscle differentiation in the upper oviduct post - mating ( Figure 4A - 4F ) .
Similarly , the increased abundance of Cora and Nrg , molecules that are essential for SJ development and function [ 50 ] is consistent with the observation that SJs in the upper oviduct are immature and / or that mating induces changes in the apical extracellular matrix whose secretion may be regulated , in part , by SJs as occurs in the trachea [ 27 , 28 ] .
Other post - mating changes that indicate that mating induces tissue - wide differentiation include increased HAJs along the basolateral membrane and increased innervation .
Analysis of protein abundance following different mating regimes ( unmated , once - mated , twice - mated ) gave us further insights into the possible roles that mating - responsive proteins play in the oviduct .
For example , Mlp84B is only responsive to the first mating , while the epithelial proteins examined ( Cora , Nrg and Hts ) are responsive to the first and second mating .
Furthermore , the response to the second mating is different from the response to the first mating .
Taken together , these results suggest that Mlp84B is required for the final maturation of the oviduct , while the epithelial proteins examined are required for both the maturation and maintenance of the oviduct at a high functional state .
Moreover , the post - mating pattern of Mlp84B supports the idea that the first mating induces the final maturation of the oviduct .
The rise and fall of Mlp84B abundance after the first mating ( Figure 5 ) parallels the expression pattern of Mlp84B during development where peaks in Mlp84B transcription occur during periods of embryogenesis and metamorphosis when muscle is differentiating [ 49 ] .
Using different mating regimes we tested whether the first / early mating is essential for maintenance of high reproductive output in the second mating .
Our results suggest that mating at an early age is essential to achieve maximum reproductive output ( i . e . high fecundity and fertility ) .
Since the first mating increases reproductive output ( evidence from our mating regime experiments ) , it is likely that the ultrastructural changes detected in mated 3 - day - old females lead to a highly functional oviduct .
We suggest that the final maturation of the oviduct includes a mating - dependent stage .
We propose that during the first few days post - eclosion , the oviduct undergoes the first phase of differentiation , after which the oviduct is developmentally poised for a rapid response to an extrinsic cue ( mating ) .
Mating then triggers the second phase of maturation ( tissue remodeling and modulation ) which is essential for proper oviduct function ( Figure 7 ) .
We further propose that the second phase of maturation consists of processes that are mating - independent and - dependent , and that both of these pathways are essential to produce a functional oviduct .
For example , initial formation of SJs occurs prior to mating ( mating - independent ) while the increased apical secretion and development of HAJs are mating - dependent .
The oviduct musculature is an example where both mating - independent and - dependent processes play a role .
Muscles are highly differentiated in the lower oviduct prior to mating , while muscle differentiation is ongoing in the upper oviduct and increases after mating .
Although the onset of muscle differentiation in both regions is mating - independent , the further differentiation of muscle in the upper oviduct is mating - dependent .
Another possible interpretation of the role of mating on oviduct maturation is that mating accelerates and synchronizes processes that are essential for the functional maturation of the oviduct .
It will therefore be interesting to examine the oviducts of older females to determine the status of oviduct maturation .
What is the benefit of mating - induced differentiation of the oviduct tissues ?
Unmated females are capable of laying eggs , albeit at a reduced rate as compared to mated females of the same age .
One possible interpretation is that reproduction is energetically costly , thus delaying oviduct maturation until sperm is available is advantageous to the female .
This may reflect the evolution of a mechanism to optimize reproductive capacity in early adulthood in short - lived animals .
In summary , we have identified events at the cellular , molecular and physiological levels that are part of an efficient and specific program for reproduction .
Drosophila affords us the opportunity to uncover the signaling pathways that coordinate these events to produce a physiologically functional organ .
Methods
Flies
Wild - type Canton - S flies:__entity__ were used for the fecundity / fertility experiments and confocal analysis .
Wild - type Canton - S5 [ 57 ] flies:__entity__ were used for electron microscopy .
All flies:__entity__ were kept in a 12 hrs light / dark cycle at 23 +/- 2 degrees C .
Upon eclosion , females and males were collected on ice and held separately until 3 ( females and males ) or 10 ( females ) days of age .
Sample preparation
For all assays ( unless described differently ) unmated females were placed with 3 - day - old unmated males and observed until mating initiated .
At the end of mating , females were aspirated into fresh vials and held for 6 hrs .
At 6 hrs after the start of mating , females were placed on ice for dissection .
Previous molecular studies indicate changes in protein abundance at 3 hrs post - mating .
We hypothesize that these molecular changes will translate into morphological changes in the next few hours .
We chose to analyze the morphology of mated females at 6 h post - mating as opposed to later times post - mating because the changes observed at later times may be due , in part , to the high rate of eggs passing through the oviduct .
Electron microscopy
Reproductive tracts were dissected in Schneider ' s Drosophila:__entity__ medium ( Sigma ) on ice and processed for electron microscopy as described in [ 42 ] .
Tracts were flat - embedded between two sheets of Aclar ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) , which allowed us to image the entire tract at the light microscopic level prior to sectioning .
Sections were cut on a Reichart Ultracut microtome .
One - mu m thick sections were stained with 1 % toluidine blue , and viewed with a Zeiss Axoplan microscope .
Ultrathin sections ( ~ 100 nm ) were mounted on formvar grids , stained with lead citrate , and viewed with a Philips / FEI Morgagni 268 TEM at 80 kV .
Our analysis is based on 4 unmated samples and 3 mated samples .
Two unmated samples were cut in the longitudinal plane and two additional unmated samples were cut in the transverse plane , while one mated sample was cut in the longitudinal plane and two additional mated samples were cut in the transverse plane .
For longitudinal sections , the entire tract was re - embedded and cut .
For samples cut in the transverse plane , the flat - embedded reproductive tract was divided into three regions : ( 1 ) lateral oviducts and upper common oviducts , ( 2 ) middle common oviduct , and ( 3 ) lower common oviduct .
Each region was re - embedded and sectioned .
It is beyond the scope of this paper to describe all three regions , and our analysis focuses on the uppermost and lowermost regions .
Immunocytochemistry
Reproductive tracts were dissected in Yamamoto ' s Ringer ( 10 mM MOPS ; 80 mM NaCl ; 10 mM KCL ; 0 . 2 mM MgCl2 ; 0 . 1 mM CaCl2 ) with 5 % ( w / v ) sucrose on ice , fixed in 4 % paraphormaldehyde in PBS ( phosphate - buffered saline ; 0 . 85 % NaCl , 1 . 4 mM KH2 PO4 , 8 mM Na2 HPO4 , pH 7 . 4 ) for 45 min and then washed in PBS .
The reproductive tracts were then incubated in blocking solution ( 0 . 5 % Triton x - 100 , 3 % NGS , 0 . 1 % BSA ) for 2 hrs at room temperature .
The following primary antibodies , reagents , and dilutions were used : Cy3 - conjugated goat:__entity__ anti - HRP , 1 : 200 ( Jackson Immunochemicals , West Grove , PA ) ; mouse:__entity__ anti - Disc Large ( DLG ) , 1 : 1000 ( Developmental Hybridoma Bank ) , Alexa Fluor 488 - phalloidin , 1 : 200 ( Invitrogen , Molecular Probes , Scotland ) .
Secondary antibodies were Alexa Flour 488 - conjugated Goat:__entity__ anti - mouse:__entity__ , 1 : 200 and Alexa Flour 546 - conjugated Goat:__entity__ anti - rabbit:__entity__ , 1 : 200 ( Invitrogen , Molecular Probes , Scotland ) .
Reproductive tracts were incubated with the different primary antibodies ( diluted in PBS + 0 . 2 % Triton x - 100 ) for 2 hr at room temperature , washed with PBST , incubated with secondary antibodies for 2 hrs at room temperature and washed with PBS .
Reproductive tracts of the different treatments were mounted with Antifade media [ 58 ] on a multi - well glass slide ( Hendley - Essex , UK ) .
For each treatment ( unmated , mated ) and antibody / reagent ( HRP , DLG , phalloidin ) a minimum of ten reproductive tracts from at least two independent biological replicates were prepared .
Confocal microscopy
Reproductive tracts were viewed with a Zeiss 510 laser scanning confocal microscope using 20 x and 60 x objective with additional zooming .
Optical sections from different focal plans of each reproductive tract region ( lateral oviducts , common oviduct , uterus ) were collected and projected as a reconstructed three - dimensional image using LSM image browser ( version 3 , 5 , 0 , 376 ) software .
Image collections were identical for each of the different reproductive tract regions analyzed .
Quantitation of bouton number
To quantify the number of boutons in the lateral and common oviducts we used ImageJ software ( 1 . 37b , National Institutes of Health ) to analyze confocal images of anti - HRP and anti - DLG labeled boutons in the oviduct .
The number of boutons per unit area was quantified with the Particle Analysis Tool .
Briefly , to differentiate between the boutons , the particle analysis tool requires the image to be a " binary " image ( i . e . , black or white ) , thus we first converted the images to gray scale .
We then set a " threshold " range so that pixels in the image whose value lies in this range are converted to black ; pixels with values outside this range are converted to white .
We next defined a region of interest ( ROI ) within the oviduct to count particles ( i . e . count boutons ) .
This ROI was saved and served to measure the number of boutons per unit area in each treatment .
For each oviduct we counted the number of anti - HRP and anti - DLG labeled boutons in two ROIs within the lateral oviducts and two ROIs in the common oviduct .
One - way ANOVA ( SPSS 15 . 0 ) was used to measure the difference in bouton number per unit area in different regions of the oviducts , in both unmated and mated females .
Quantitation of cytoskeleton proteins
Sample preparation
To evaluate the effect of mating on the abundance of the cytoskeleton proteins tested , females were : ( i ) aged for 3 days , mated with 3 - day - old unmated males and their oviducts were dissected after 6 hrs post - mating ( Once3 ) ; ( ii ) aged for 3 days , mated with 3 - day - old unmated males and their oviducts were dissected after 7 days ( Once3 day10 ) ; ( iii ) aged for 3 days , mated first with 3 - day - old unmated males and held singly for 7 days .
At 10 days of age , female were mated again with 3 - day - old unmated males .
Oviducts were dissected at 6 hrs post - second mating ( Twice3 & 10 ) .
We also examined 5 - day - old and 10 - day - old unmated females ( UM5 , UM10 respectively ) .
SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) and Western blotting
For each mating regime , sixty oviducts were pooled and 30 mu l of SDS - PAGE sample buffer was added as described in [ 59 ] .
Samples were boiled , and then frozen at - 20 degrees C until loading .
SDS - PAGE was performed on 12 % polyacrylamide gels and western blotted as in [ 60 ] .
Proteins were cross - linked to the filter .
The following primary antibodies and dilutions were used : mouse:__entity__ anti - Neuroglian ( kindly provided by M . Hortsch ) 1 : 250 ; Guinea:__entity__ pig:__entity__ anti - Coracle ( kindly provided by R . G . Fehon ) 1 : 2500 ; rabbit:__entity__ anti - Mlp84B ( kindly provided by M . Beckerle ) 1 : 1000 ; mouse:__entity__ anti - hts ( 1B1 , Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank , DSHB ) 1 : 75 ; mouse:__entity__ anti - Na , K - ATPase ( alpha 5 , DSHB ) 1 : 100 .
Secondary antibodies included : anti - Guinea:__entity__ pig:__entity__ IgG ( peroxidase conjugated ) , anti - Rabbit:__entity__ IgG and anti - Mouse:__entity__ IgG ( developed in goat:__entity__ , Sigma , Israel ) 1 : 10 , 000 .
Proteins were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence ( ECL ) detection system ( Amersham Piscataway , NJ ) .
Analysis
The developed film was scanned and the signal intensity ( protein abundance ) of each band was determined using ImageJ software ( 1 . 37d , National Institutes of Health ) .
We evaluated protein abundance by measuring the mean gray value of a specific band and the background .
The mean gray value of the background was then subtracted from that of the measured band .
Relative protein abundance in mated oviduct vs . 3 - day - old unmated oviduct was then calculated .
Four independent biological replicates were prepared for each mating status .
The reported abundance ( see Figure 5 ) is the relative ratio ( mated / unmated or unmated / unmated ) of at least three replicates that showed the same trend .
Examination of female reproductive output
Mating regimes
To evaluate the effect of mating on reproductive output females were treated as follows : ( i ) aged for 3 days and mated with 3 - day - old unmated males ( Once3 ) ; ( ii ) aged for 10 days and mated with 3 - day - old unmated males ( Once10 ) ; ( iii ) aged for 3 days , mated first with 3 - day - old unmated males , held for 7 days and mated again with 3 - day - old unmated males ( Twice3 & 10 ) .
In all cases male and female pairs were observed to record mating initiation and termination .
Analysis
Following mating , females were aspirated into fresh vials , held singly and allowed to lay eggs for 6 hrs , then transferred daily ( each 24 hrs ) to fresh vials .
The number of eggs laid and the number of eclosed adults were counted from vials created at 6 hrs , 1 , 2 and 3 days post - mating .
To ascertain the baseline of female egg - laying , we also included in our experiment unmated females that were kept in the same conditions as mated females .
The number of eggs laid by unmated females was counted from vials created at 6 hrs , 1 , 2 and 3 days after placing the females in the holding vials .
In addition , we also recorded the pattern of unmated female egg - laying for 10 days .

Efficacy of intra - articular hyaluronan ( Synvisc (R) ) for the treatment of osteoarthritis affecting the first metatarsophalangeal joint of the foot ( hallux limitus ) : study protocol for a randomised placebo controlled trial
Abstract
Background
Osteoarthritis of the first metatarsophalangeal joint ( MPJ ) of the foot , termed hallux limitus , is common and painful .
Numerous non - surgical interventions have been proposed for this disorder , however there is limited evidence for their efficacy .
Intra - articular injections of hyaluronan have shown beneficial effects in case - series and clinical trials for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the first metatarsophalangeal joint .
However , no study has evaluated the efficacy of this form of treatment using a randomised placebo controlled trial .
This article describes the design of a randomised placebo controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of intra - articular hyaluronan ( Synvisc (R) ) to reduce pain and improve function in people:__entity__ with hallux limitus .
Methods
One hundred and fifty community - dwelling men:__entity__ and women:__entity__ aged 18 years and over with hallux limitus ( who satisfy inclusion and exclusion criteria ) will be recruited .
Participants:__entity__ will be randomised , using a computer - generated random number sequence , to receive a single intra - articular injection of up to 1 ml hyaluronan ( Synvisc (R) ) or sterile saline ( placebo ) into the first MPJ .
The injections will be performed by an interventional radiologist using fluoroscopy to ensure accurate deposition of the hyaluronan in the joint .
Participants:__entity__ will be given the option of a second and final intra - articular injection ( of Synvisc (R) or sterile saline according to the treatment group they are in ) either 1 or 3 months post - treatment if there is no improvement in pain and the participant:__entity__ has not experienced severe adverse effects after the first injection .
The primary outcome measures will be the pain and function subscales of the Foot Health Status Questionnaire .
The secondary outcome measures will be pain at the first MPJ ( during walking and at rest ) , stiffness at the first MPJ , passive non - weightbearing dorsiflexion of the first MPJ , plantar flexion strength of the toe - flexors of the hallux , global satisfaction with the treatment , health - related quality of life ( assessed using the Short - Form - 36 version two questionnaire ) , magnitude of symptom change , use of pain - relieving medication and changes in dynamic plantar pressure distribution ( maximum force and peak pressure ) during walking .
Data will be collected at baseline , then 1 , 3 and 6 months post - treatment .
Data will be analysed using the intention to treat principle .
Discussion
This study is the first randomised placebo controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of intra - articular hyaluronan ( Synvisc (R) ) for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the first MPJ ( hallux limitus ) .
The study has been pragmatically designed to ensure that the study findings can be implemented into clinical practice if this form of treatment is found to be an effective treatment strategy .

Background
Osteoarthritis ( OA ) is a degenerative joint disease that commonly presents within the first metatarsophalangeal joint ( MPJ ) of the foot .
The terms hallux limitus and hallux rigidus have frequently been used interchangeably to describe differing severities of pain and limitation of motion associated with OA at the first MPJ [ 1 ] .
Hallux limitus is a progressive osteoarthritic condition of the first MPJ that may advance to an end - stage presentation of hallux rigidus where the joint fuses and there is a complete restriction of motion [ 1 ] .
First MPJ OA is the second most common disorder affecting the foot after hallux valgus [ 2 ] .
The prevalence of the condition increases with age , and it has been reported that radiographic changes in the first MPJ affect are evident in approximately 46 % of women:__entity__ and 32 % of men:__entity__ at 60 years of age [ 3 ] .
Osteoarthritis at the first MPJ is characterised by the symptoms of pain and stiffness at the joint [ 1 ] .
Secondary painful symptoms relate to compensations during gait that may occur due to the reduced motion of the first MPJ [ 1 ] .
The presence of pain associated with first MPJ OA impacts on normal walking and quality of life [ 4 ] .
Treatment of hallux limitus involves conservative measures ( such as physical therapy , foot orthoses , footwear modification , joint manipulation and injection with corticosteroid ) [ 5 ] , or surgical intervention ( either joint - salvage or joint - destructive procedures ) [ 6 ] .
Pharmacological treatment is also often undertaken as an adjunct for pain relief in the management of hallux limitus [ 6 ] .
However , although non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) and cyclooxygenase - 2 inhibitors have been found to be effective in the management of various forms of OA , gastrointestinal complications remain a concern [ 7 ] .
In light of these limitations with existing treatments , an alternative treatment termed ' viscosupplementation ' - the intra - articular injection of hyaluronan into arthritic joints with the aim of restoring the viscoelasticity of the synovial fluid [ 8 ] - has been proposed and has attracted considerable attention in the medical literature as a treatment for OA [ 9 ] .
In particular , both the American College of Rheumatology ( ACR ) and European League Against Rheumatism ( EULAR ) recommend hyaluronan in the management of OA of the knee [ 10 , 11 ] .
Although the results of systematic reviews investigating the effectiveness of this type of treatment for knee OA are controversial , the most recent update of the Cochrane systematic review evaluating viscosupplementation for the treatment of knee OA concluded that viscosupplementation was both safe and effective for the treatment of OA and was superior or equivalent to any form of systemic intervention or intra - articular corticosteroids [ 9 , 12 ] .
Despite there being a large number of studies investigating the effectiveness of hyaluronan for knee OA , few studies have investigated the effects of this form of treatment for OA at the first MPJ [ 13 ] .
In a case - series retrospective study , 14 patients:__entity__ with radiographically confirmed OA at the first MPJ that received up to 3 intra - articular injections of 1 ml hyaluronan ( Ostenil (R) Mini ) ( sodium hyaluronate ) reported a statistically significant reduction in pain ( reported using a visual analogue scale ) after 6 months [ 14 ] .
The treatment was well tolerated , with 3 / 14 ( 21 % ) participants:__entity__ reporting mild adverse reactions at the injection site .
In another study , Pons et al [ 13 ] compared a single intra - articular injection of 1 ml Ostenil (R) Mini ( sodium hyaluronate ) with 1 ml Trigon depot (R) ( triamcinolone acetonide , a corticosteroid ) for the treatment of painful , grade 1 hallux limitus ( Karasick and Wapner [ 15 ] scale ) in 37 participants:__entity__ ( 40 feet ) [ 13 ] .
Both treatment groups showed statistically significant reductions in pain at rest or on palpation for up to 12 weeks post - injection .
However , hyaluronan treatment resulted in a statistically significant greater reduction in pain during walking and greater improvement in the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society ( AOFAS ) hallux MPJ score compared to treatment with triamcinolone acetonide .
The treatment with hyaluronan was well tolerated , with 2 / 20 ( 10 % ) participants:__entity__ reporting mild adverse reactions at the injection site .
Although both of these studies suggest that intra - articular hyaluronan is safe and effective for the treatment of hallux limitus , neither used a placebo control group [ 13 , 14 ] .
This limitation is significant as a placebo effect can account for 79 % of the efficacy of intra - articular hyaluronan treatment [ 16 ] .
Further , both studies are limited in that neither of the studies used blinding of both the participants:__entity__ and assessors in their protocols .
It is therefore possible that the positive effects of hyaluronan may have been overestimated .
Accordingly , the aims of this project are to conduct a double blind randomised controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of intra - articular hyaluronan ( Synvisc (R) ) on ( i ) foot pain and function ; ( ii ) the range of motion of the first MPJ ; ( iii ) the strength of the plantarflexor muscles of the first MPJ ; ( iv ) the health related quality of life ; and ( v ) the use of pain - relieving medications in people:__entity__ with hallux limitus .
The study protocol is presented in this paper , consistent with the recommendations of Editorial Board of BioMed Central [ 17 ] .
Methods
Design
This study is a parallel group , participant:__entity__ and assessor blinded , randomised controlled trial with a 6 month follow - up ( Figure 1 ) .
It has been developed using the principles described by Osteoarthritis Research Society International ( OARSI ) Clinical Trials Task Force guidelines [ 18 ] .
Participants:__entity__ will be randomised to receive a single intra - articular injection of up to 1 ml hyaluronan ( Synvisc (R) ) or sterile saline ( placebo ) into the first MPJ .
Allocation to either the Synvisc (R) or placebo groups will be achieved using a computer - generated random number sequence .
The allocation sequence will be generated and held by an external person:__entity__ not directly involved in the trial .
Concealment of the allocation sequence will be ensured as each participant:__entity__ ' s allocation will be contained in a sealed opaque envelope .
Envelopes will be made opaque by using a sheet of aluminium foil inside the envelope .
In addition , a system using carbon paper will be employed so the details ( name and date of recruitment ) are transferred from the outside of the envelope to the paper inside the envelope containing the allocation prior to opening the seal .
Assessors and participants:__entity__ will be blinded to group allocation .
Participants:__entity__ will be given the option of a second and final intra - articular injection ( of Synvisc (R) or sterile saline according to the treatment group they are in ) on days 30 or 90 if there is no improvement in pain and the participant:__entity__ has not experienced severe adverse effects after the first injection ) .

Intra - articular injections for the treatment groups
Participants:__entity__ will be randomised to receive a single intra - articular injection of up to 1 ml of hyaluronan ( Synvisc (R) ; Genzyme Biosurgery , Genzyme Corporation , NJ , USA ) or sterile saline ( placebo ) into the first MPJ .
Each 2 ml ampoule of Synvisc (R) contains 16 mg of hylan G - F 20 ( cross - linked hylan polymers ; hylan A and B ) , 17 mg sodium chloride , 0 . 32 mg disodium hydrogen phosphate , 0 . 08 mg sodium dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate .
The hyaluronan is extracted from chicken:__entity__ combs and the purified material has an average molecular weight of 6 , 000 kDa .
The injections will be performed by the same experienced interventional radiologist ( AEZ ) using fluoroscopic imaging to ensure accurate deposition of the hyaluronan within the joint .
As the Synvisc (R) is provided in ampoules that are labelled with the product name , it will not be possible to blind the injector , however this person:__entity__ is not involved in generation of the allocation order , recruitment , assessment or data analysis .
The intra - articular injection will be performed using a 21 gauge ( 0 . 80 x 19 mm ) Surflo (R) ( Terumo (R) Corp . , Tokyo , Japan ) winged infusion set under aseptic procedures .
Either a dorso - lateral or dorso - medial approach for injection will be used at the discretion of the injector ( depending on which approach provides minimum interference from the osteophytes at the first MPJ joint margins ) .
No anaesthetic will be used .
If the participant:__entity__ has bilateral painful first MPJs , only one side ( the most painful side ) will be treated and used for data collection .
The injector will record the volume of the agent that is injected .
Participants:__entity__ will be given the option of a second and final intra - articular injection ( of Synvisc (R) or sterile saline according to the treatment group they are in ) on days 30 or 90 if there is no improvement in pain ( assessed using the VAPS for pain during walking or at rest ) and the participant:__entity__ has not experienced severe adverse effects after the first injection ) .
Assessments
Initial assessments
An initial assessment will be performed to determine the eligibility of participants:__entity__ for this study .
Demographic data will be collected including the age , gender , height and weight of participants:__entity__ .
Data will also be obtained concerning the presentation of symptoms ( foot affected , duration of symptoms ) .
If the participant:__entity__ has bilateral painful first MPJs , the most painful side will be used for data collection and subsequent treatment .
To establish eligibility for the study , participants:__entity__ will undergo a clinical assessment , have one set of dorso - plantar and lateral weight - bearing x - rays taken of their feet to grade the severity of first MPJ OA as well as undergo a blood test to assess serum uric acid levels ( to exclude gout ) .
Weightbearing dorso - plantar and lateral radiographic views will be obtained from both feet with the participant:__entity__ standing in a relaxed bipedal stance position .
All x - rays will be taken by the same medical imaging department using a Shimadzu UD150LRII 50 kw / 30 kHz Generator and 0 . 6 / 1 . 2 P18DE - 80S high speed x - ray tube from a ceiling suspended tube mount .
AGFA MD40 CR digital phosphor plates in a 24 cm x 30 cm cassette will be used .
For dorso - plantar projections , the x - ray tube will be angled 15 degrees cephalad and centered at the base of the third metatarsal .
For lateral projections , the tube will be angled 90 degrees and centered at the base of the third metatarsal .
The film focus distance will be set at 100 cm [ 19 ] .
Baseline assessments and outcome measures
Participants:__entity__ who are eligible for the study will be invited to attend a baseline assessment .
During the baseline assessment , participants:__entity__ will undergo primary and secondary outcome measurements prior to receiving their injection .
The outcome measurements have been developed in accordance of the recommendations of the OARSI Clinical Trials Task Force guidelines [ 18 ] .
Primary outcome measures
Outcome measurements ( primary and secondary ) will occur at four time - points at baseline , 1 , 3 and 6 months post - treatment ( after the intra - articular injection of Synvisc (R) or placebo ) .
The assessor performing the measurements will be blinded as to which treatment group participants:__entity__ have been allocated to .
Participants:__entity__ who receive a second treatment at day 30 or 90 will be followed for a further 30 days or 90 days respectively and undergo outcome measurements at 7 or 9 months respectively .
The primary outcome measures will be the Pain and Function subscales of the Foot Health Status Questionnaire ( FHSQ ) [ 24 ] .
The FHSQ includes 13 questions that assess four domains of foot health , Foot pain , Foot function , Footwear and General foot health .
The FHSQ has been subjected to an extensive validation ( content , criterion and construct validity ) process .
It has a high test - retest reliability ( intraclass correlation coefficients ranging from 0 . 74 to 0 . 92 ) and a high degree of internal consistency ( Cronbach ' s alpha ranging from 0 . 85 to 0 . 88 ) [ 24 ] .
Rigorous reviews have rated it as one of the highest quality foot health status measures currently available [ 25 - 27 ] .
Secondary outcome measures
The secondary outcome measures will be :
( i ) Severity of pain
Severity of pain at the first MPJ during walking , and during rest , over the past week will be assessed using a 100 mm visual analogue pain scale .
The left side of the scale ( 0 mm ) will be labelled " no pain " and the right side of the scale ( 100 mm ) will be labelled " worst pain possible " for each question [ 25 , 28 ] .
( ii ) Severity and duration of stiffness at the first metatarsophalangeal joint
The severity of stiffness at the first MPJ during walking over the past week will be assessed using a 100 mm visual analogue scale .
The left side of the scale ( 0 mm ) will be labelled " not stiff at all " and the right side of the scale ( 100 mm ) will be labelled " most stiff possible " .
The average duration of stiffness at the first MPJ over the past week will be assessed using a four category scale response .
The responses are : " none " , " 1 - 15 minutes " , " 16 - 30 minutes " and " greater than 30 minutes " [ 29 ] .
( iii ) Passive , non - weightbearing dorsiflexion range of motion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint
First MPJ dorsiflexion range of motion will be measured using a goniometer as the maximum angle at which the hallux cannot be passively moved into further extension in a non - weightbearing position ( Figure 2 ) [ 30 ] .
The test will be performed two times and the average will be used for analysis .
This measurement technique shows high intra - reliability ( ICC = 0 . 95 , standard error of mean = 1 . 3 degrees ) [ 30 ] .
( iv ) Plantar flexion strength of the toe - flexors of the hallux
Plantar flexion strength of the toe - flexors of the hallux will be measured using the Mat Scan (R) plantar pressure measurement device [ 31 ] .
Participants:__entity__ will be seated with the hip , knee , and ankle at 90 degrees and their foot placed over the Mat Scan (R) plantar pressure measurement device ( Tekscan , Boston , MA , USA ) ( Figure 3a ) .
This system consists of a 5 - mm thick floor mat ( 432 x 368 mm ) incorporating 2288 resistive sensors ( 1 . 4 sensors / cm2 ) sampling at a rate of 40 Hz .
The mat will be calibrated for each participant:__entity__ using his or her own bodyweight before each testing session .
Participants:__entity__ will be instructed to use their toe - flexor muscles to maximally push their hallux down on the MatScan (R) device and forces under the hallux will be recorded ( Figure 3b ) .
The test will be performed three times for the hallux and the maximal force will be used for analysis .
The test - retest reliability of this measurement technique has previously been shown to be high , with intraclass correlation coefficients ( ICCs ) = 0 . 88 ( 95 % CI 0 . 81 - 0 . 93 ) [ 31 ] .
( vi ) Plantar pressure measurement
Plantar pressures will be recorded during level barefoot walking using the MatScan (R) system ( Tekscan (R) , Boston , MA , USA ) .
The two - step gait initiation protocol will be used to obtain foot pressure data , as it requires fewer trials than the mid - gait protocol and has similar re - test reliability [ 32 ] .
Three trials will be recorded , which has been found to be sufficient to ensure adequate reliability of pressure data [ 32 , 33 ] .
Following data collection , the Research Foot (R) software ( version 5 . 24 ) will be used to construct individual " masks " to determine maximum force ( kg ) and peak pressure ( kg / cm2 ) under seven regions of the foot : hallux , lesser toes , 1st MPJ , 2nd MPJ , 3rd to 5th MPJs , midfoot and heel ( Figure 4a ) .
For each region , the median of the three trials will be used for analysis .
Typical plantar pressure recordings from a participant:__entity__ are shown in Figure 4b .
( vi ) Global satisfaction with the treatment
Global satisfaction with the treatment will be assessed using a 5 - point Likert scale , as well as a dichotomous ( yes / no ) scale .
The five point - Likert scale will ask " How satisfied are you with the treatment you received for your big - toe joint pain ? " , and will have the following five responses : " Dissatisfied " , " Only moderately satisfied " , " Fairly satisfied " , " Clearly satisfied " and " Very satisfied " .
The dichotomous scale of satisfaction will be answered as " Yes " ' or " No " in response to the question : " Would you recommend the treatment that you received to someone else with big - toe joint pain " .
( vii ) Health related quality of life
The Short - Form - 36 ( version two ) ( SF - 36 ) questionnaire will be used to assess health related quality of life .
The SF - 36 is a 36 question survey that measures eight health concepts most affected by disease and treatment .
The eight health concepts can then be used to form two summary measures : Physical health and Mental health .
The Short Form - 36 ( SF - 36 ) has been extensively validated and is one of the most widely used instruments to measure health status .
The SF - 36 shows content , concurrent , criterion , construct , and predictive evidence of validity .
The reliability of the eight concepts and two summary measures has been assessed using both internal consistency and test - retest methods .
Reliability statistics have exceeded 0 . 80 [ 34 - 37 ] .
( viii ) Self - reported magnitude of symptom change
Self - reported magnitude of symptom change will be measured using a 15 - point Likert scale .
The scale will ask participants:__entity__ " how much have your symptoms in your big - toe joint have changed from the beginning of the study to now ? " .
The fifteen responses will range from " A very great deal better " to " A very great deal worse " .
( ix ) Use of rescue medications to relieve pain at the first metatarsophalangeal joint
The number of participants:__entity__ who consumed rescue medication ( e . g . , paracetamol ) and mean consumption of rescue medication to relieve pain at the first MPJ ( mean grams of paracetamol / participant:__entity__ / month ] will be assessed using a medications diary that participants:__entity__ will self - complete [ 38 , 39 ] .
The diary will be returned to the assessor at monthly intervals for analysis .
( x ) Frequency and severity of adverse events as safety variables
The frequency ( number of participants:__entity__ affected and number of cases ) and types of adverse events ( including adverse drug reactions ) in each treatment group during the trial will be recorded using a questionnaire that participants:__entity__ will complete during the follow - up appointments at 1 , 3 and 6 months post - treatment [ 40 ] .
To classify the ' type ' of adverse event , a blinded assessor will classify the adverse event as being serious or non - serious [ 40 ] .
Any serious adverse events , defined as adverse events leading to serious disability , hospital admission , or prolongation of hospitalisation , life - threatening events ; or death ) will be further classified using the International Classification of Diseases ( ICD ) codes [ 41 ] .
Non - serious adverse events will include both local ( pain , effusion and heat , with each classified as mild , moderate , severe ) and systemic adverse events .
An open - response type format will also be available for participant:__entity__ responses .
Sample size
The sample size for the study has been pre - specified using an a priori power analysis using the primary outcome measure of the pain domain of the FHSQ [ 42 ] .
One hundred and forty two participants:__entity__ ( i . e . 71 per group ) will provide power of 90 % to detect a minimally important difference in the pain domain of the FHSQ ( i . e . 14 points on the FHSQ questionnaire ) with the significance level set at p < 0 . 05 .
A difference of 14 points was determined to be a clinically significant difference worth detecting [ 43 ] and a standard deviation of 25 was derived from a previous report [ 44 ] .
This calculation included a 5 % drop - out rate [ 13 ] .
However , we will aim to recruit 150 participants:__entity__ ( ~ 75 participants:__entity__ per intervention group ) .
Further , we have conservatively ignored the extra precision provided by covariate analysis when estimating the sample size .
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis will be undertaken using SPSS version 14 . 0 ( SPSS Corp , Chicago , Ill , USA ) and STATA 8 ( Stata Corp , College Station , Tex . , USA ) statistical software .
All analyses will be conducted on an intention - to - treat principle using all randomised participants:__entity__ [ 45 - 47 ] .
Missing data will be replaced with the last score carried forward [ 48 ] .
Standard tests for normal distribution will be used and transformation carried out if required .
Demographic characteristics ( gender , age , weight , height , body mass index ) will be determined for the baseline visit for each treatment group .
Summary statistics will be calculated for duration of symptoms , side affected ( left , right , bilateral ) , grade of OA at the first MPJ [ 19 ] as well as all primary and secondary outcome measurements for each treatment group .
Analyses will be conducted on 1 , 3 and 6 month outcome measures .
The continuously - scored outcome measures at 1 , 3 and 6 months will be compared using analysis of covariance with baseline scores and intervention group entered as independent variables [ 49 , 50 ] .
The exception to this will be the plantar pressure measurements which will be analysed at baseline , 1 , 3 and 6 months using two - way repeated measures analysis of variance statistics .
Post - hoc comparisons will be performed using Bonferroni - adjusted t - tests .
Nominal and ordinal scaled data will be compared at 1 , 3 and 6 months using Mann - Whitney U - tests and chi - square analyses ( or Fisher ' s exact test where appropriate ) respectively .
Effect sizes will be determined using Cohen ' s d ( continuous scaled data ) or odds ratios ( nominal scaled data and ordinal scaled data ) as appropriate .
The outcome measurements obtained at 7 or 9 months for participants:__entity__ that receive a second and final intra - articular injection ( of Synvisc (R) or sterile saline according to the treatment group they are in ) on days 30 or 90 respectively , will also be analysed as described above .
These analyses will be classified as secondary outcomes .
Discussion
This study is a randomised placebo controlled trial designed to investigate the efficacy of intra - articular hyaluronan ( Synvisc (R) ) to reduce pain and improve function in people:__entity__ with OA of the first MPJ ( hallux limitus ) .
Two studies have previously investigated the efficacy of intra - articular hyaluronan for the treatment of first MPJ OA [ 13 , 14 ] .
However , neither of these studies used a placebo control group .
To our knowledge , this is the first randomised controlled trial using intra - articular hyaluronan for OA of the first MPJ .
The use of a placebo control group is essential for studies evaluating the effects of intra - articular therapies as there is likely to be a large placebo response related to the injection procedure and this may inflate the results in uncontrolled evaluations [ 51 ] .
Indeed , a recent meta - analysis of hyaluronan for knee OA concluded that a placebo effect accounted for 79 % of the efficacy of intra - articular hyaluronan [ 16 ] .
The study protocol and outcome measures have been developed in accordance of the recommendations of the OARSI Clinical Trials Task Force guidelines [ 18 ] .
The outcome measures are pain and function subscales of the FHSQ , pain and stiffness at the first MPJ , range of motion ( dorsiflexion ) of the first MPJ , plantar flexion strength of muscles of the first MPJ , generic health related quality of life ( SF - 36 ) , patient:__entity__ satisfaction with treatment , consumption of rescue medication as well as frequency and nature of adverse effects .
These outcomes will be measured at baseline then at 1 , 3 and 6 months after treatment .
Previous research suggests that the effects of intra - articular hyaluronan persist for up to 12 months following treatment [ 9 , 38 ] .
Thus , the use of follow - up assessments at 6 month post - treatment will allow us to determine if the effects , if any , of intra - articular hyaluronan persist in the longer term .
Participants:__entity__ will be given the option of a second and final intra - articular injection ( of Synvisc (R) or sterile saline according to the treatment group they are in ) on days 30 or 90 if there is no improvement in their symptoms .
Although this has the potential to complicate the interpretation of the results of the study , this protocol was included as it is likely to be more reflective of clinical practice [ 14 ] , and this is in keeping with the pragmatic nature of this trial .
In summary , this project is the first randomised controlled trial to be conducted to evaluate the efficacy of intra - articular hyaluronan for reducing pain and improving function in people:__entity__ with hallux limitus .
The study protocol , including interventions , have been pragmatically designed to ensure that the study findings are generaliseable to clinical practice .
Recruitment for the study will commence in June 2008 , and we expect final results to be available in mid - 2010 .

p8 inhibits the growth of human:__entity__ pancreatic cancer cells and its expression is induced through pathways involved in growth inhibition and repressed by factors promoting cell growth
Abstract
Background
p8 is a stress - induced protein with multiple functions and biochemically related to the architectural factor HMG - I / Y .
We analyzed the expression and function of p8 in pancreatic cancer - derived cells .
Methods
Expression of p8 was silenced in the human:__entity__ pancreatic cancer cell lines Panc - 1 and BxPc - 3 by infection with a retrovirus expressing p8 RNA in the antisense orientation .
Cell growth was measured in control and p8 - silenced cells .
Influence on p8 expression of the induction of intracellular pathways promoting cellular growth or growth arrest was monitored .
Results
p8 - silenced cells grew more rapidly than control cells transfected with the empty retrovirus .
Activation of the Ras --> Raf --> MEK --> ERK and JNK intracellular pathways down - regulated p8 expression .
In addition , the MEK1 / 2 inhibitor U0126 and the JNK inhibitor SP600125 up - regulates expression of p8 .
Conversely , p38 or TGF beta - 1 induced p8 expression whereas the specific p38 inhibitor SB203580 down - regulated p8 expression .
Finally , TGF beta - 1 induction was in part mediated through p38 .
Conclusions
p8 inhibits the growth of human:__entity__ pancreatic cancer cells .
p8 expression is induced through pathways involved in growth inhibition and repressed by factors that promote cell growth .
These results suggest that p8 belongs to a pathway regulating the growth of pancreatic cancer cells .
Background
While studying the molecular response of the injured pancreas , we identified a new gene , called p8 , whose expression is strongly induced during the acute phase of pancreatitis [ 1 ] .
Further experiments have shown that p8 mRNA is activated in almost all cells in response to several stresses [ 2 ] , including minimal stresses such as after routine change of the culture medium in the absence of any added substance [ 3 ] , indicating that p8 is a ubiquitous protein induced by cellular stress .
The p8 gene was cloned in human:__entity__ , rat:__entity__ , mouse:__entity__ , and Xenopus:__entity__ laevis:__entity__ [ 1 , 4 - 6 ] , conceptually translated from the Drosophila:__entity__ melanogaster:__entity__ genome or deduced from EST libraries ( Bos:__entity__ taurus:__entity__ , Xenopus:__entity__ tropicalis:__entity__ , Zebrafish:__entity__ , Orzzias:__entity__ latipes:__entity__ , Bombyx:__entity__ mori:__entity__ and Paralichthys:__entity__ olivaceous:__entity__ ) .
The overall degree of homology with human:__entity__ p8 ranged from 81 to 40 % .
Secondary structure prediction methods indicated that within the homologous region of the eleven proteins , there is a basic Helix - Loop - Helix secondary structure motif , characteristic of some classes of transcription factors [ 1 ] .
Even though a small protein such as p8 would not need a nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) to be transported to the nucleus , a clear NLS can be predicted for the eleven proteins comprising a bipartite domain of positively charged aminoacids .
In addition , a nuclear / cytoplasmic location has been demonstrated for human:__entity__ p8 upon overexpression of the recombinant protein and immunohistochemistry [ 4 ] , and for recombinant Xenopus:__entity__ laevis:__entity__ p8 fused to green fluorescent protein [ 6 ] .
Homology searching in databases did not reveal significant similarity of p8 with other proteins of known function .
However , biochemical properties of the mammalian p8 proteins are shared by some high mobility group proteins ( HMG ) [ 7 ] , particularly by the HMG - I / Y family .
The overall identity of human:__entity__ p8 with human:__entity__ HMG - I / Y is only about 35 % , but the molecular mass , isoelectric point , hydrophilicity plot , the resistance to denaturation after heating at 100 degrees C and the charge separation are very similar [ 8 ] .
The p8 protein seems to bind DNA weakly , as shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assay , without preference for DNA sequences .
Finally , human:__entity__ p8 has also been shown to be a substrate for protein kinase A in vitro and phosphorylated p8 has a higher content of secondary structure and binding to DNA is highly increased [ 8 ] .
An architectural role in transcription has been proposed for this protein , in analogy with the HMG - I / Y proteins , and a recent work seems to confirm this hypothesis [ 9 ] .
Functions of p8 appear to be multiple and complex .
For example , p8 mRNA expression was strongly induced in 3T3 cells upon TGF beta - 1 treatment which in turn enhances the Smad - transactivating function responsible for TGF beta - 1 activity [ 10 ] .
We also found that p8 is involved in cell cycle regulation since p8 - deficient embryonic fibroblasts grew more rapidly and incorporated more [ 3H ] thymidine and BrdU than p8 - expressing cells [ 11 ] .
Moreover , expression of p8 in breast cancer - derived cells seems to mediate the inhibition of cell growth induced by 1 , 25 - Dihydroxyvitamin D3 [ 12 ] .
On the contrary , we also reported that p8 may promote cell growth when overexpressed in Cos - 7 , AR42J and HeLa cells [ 1 , 4 ] .
In addition , p8 seems to be involved in other intracellular functions such as apoptosis since p8 - expressing fibroblasts are more sensitive than p8 - deficient fibroblasts to the apoptosis induced by DNA damage .
Also , p8 is required for endothelin - induced mesangial cell hypertrophy in diabetic kidney , in a mechanism involving ERK , JNK and PI3 kinase [ 13 ] .
p8 seems to play a functional role in the initiation of LH beta gene expression during embryonic cell differentiation [ 14 ] .
Moreover , the Drosophila:__entity__ melanogaster:__entity__ p8 homologue is involved in response to starvation and might be activated to stop cell growth in case of nutrient deprivation [ 15 ] .
Finally , a particularly attractive role in tumour progression was recently proposed for p8 [ 16 ] .
Fibroblasts obtained from p8 - expressing or p8 - deficient animals were transformed with a retroviral vector expressing both the rasV12 mutated protein and the E1A adenoviral oncogene .
In soft - agar assays , transformed p8 - expressing cells formed colonies at high frequency , as expected , but p8 - deficient transformed fibroblasts were unable to form colonies .
Similarly , transformed p8 - expressing cells produced tumours in all athymic nude:__entity__ mice:__entity__ when injected subcutaneously or intraperitoneally , whereas transformed p8 - deficient fibroblasts did not .
On the other hand , studies by another laboratory revealed that expression of the Com1 protein [ 17 ] , which is identical to human:__entity__ p8 , mediates the growth of tumour cells after metastatic establishment in a secondary organ , indicating that activated expression of Com1 / p8 in metastatic cells is required for tumour progression .
These results strongly suggest that p8 is involved in the cellular pathway ( s ) required for tumour progression and metastasis .
Our aim is to check the relevance of p8 to cancer progression in human:__entity__ .
As a first step , we investigated in the present study the function of p8 in two cell lines derived from human:__entity__ pancreatic cancer .
We observed that inhibition of p8 expression increased the cells growth rate .
In addition , activations of the Ras --> Raf --> MEK --> ERK and JNK intracellular pathways , which promote the growth of pancreatic cells , down - regulated p8 expression , whereas activation of p38 or TGF beta - 1 , which inhibit cell growth , induced its expression .
It was concluded that i / p8 inhibits the growth of human:__entity__ pancreatic cancer cell lines , ii / p8 expression is induced through pathways involved in growth inhibition and , conversely , repressed by factors that promote cell growth .
Results
p8 is silenced in pancreatic cancer cells by infection with a retrovirus expressing p8 RNA in the antisense orientation
Panc - 1 and BxPc - 3 pancreatic cells were chosen for this study because , on the one hand , both cells express higher level of p8 ( Figure 1 ) and , on the other hand , because Panc - 1 is wild - type for Smad4 / DPC4 and mutated for K - ras , while BxPc - 3 is Smad4 / DPC4 mutated and K - ras wild - type [ 18 , 19 ] , therefore representing different mechanisms of transformation and different genetic backgrounds .
K - ras and Smad4 / DPC4 mutations are the major mechanisms involved in pancreatic cancer development .
We inhibited p8 expression in both Panc - 1 and BxPc - 3 pancreatic cells by infecting cells with a retrovirus expressing the p8 asRNA ( antisense RNA ) and carrying the puromycin resistance .
The antibiotic - selected cells were analyzed by Western blotting to evaluate the intracellular amounts of p8 protein .
As shown in Figure 2 , the p8 protein was clearly visible in both Panc - 1 and BxPc - 3 pancreatic cells infected with the empty retrovirus but almost undetectable in cells infected with the retrovirus encoding the p8 asRNA showed , indicating that our anti - sense strategy is efficient to silence p8 gene expression in pancreatic cancer cells .
Preliminary studies had been conducted to select the best strategy to inhibit p8 expression .
We compared the efficacy of the stable transfection of a siRNA , using a retroviral expression vector to the asRNA strategy described above .
In our hands , the antisense strategy worked best , as judged from Western blot assessment of p8 protein expression ( data not shown ) .
p8 - silenced pancreatic cells grow more rapidly
We compared in the two cell lines the influence on growth parameters of blocking p8 expression with the p8 asRNA .
Figure 3 shows that both Panc - 1 and BxPc - 3 cells in which p8 has been silenced grew more rapidly than cells infected with the empty vector suggesting that inhibition by p8 of pancreatic cancer cell growth is independent from the mechanism of transformation and genetic background .
Serum - stimulated cellular growth down - regulates p8 expression
Fetal calf:__entity__ serum , which contains a complex mix of growth factors , can be used as inductor of cell growth .
As shown in Figure 4 expression of p8 mRNA was down - regulated in both Panc - 1 and BxPc - 3 when the cells were shifted from culture media containing 0 . 1 % fetal calf:__entity__ serum to media containing 10 % FCS .
p8 protein showed a similar behavior .
These results show that p8 expression is down - regulated in growing pancreatic cells .
The Ras --> Raf --> MEK --> ERK pathway down - regulates p8 expression in pancreatic cancer cells
Most human:__entity__ pancreatic cancers harbor mutations in the K - ras oncogene , which happens relatively early in pancreatic tumorigenesis [ 20 ] .
The oncogenic mutation of the K - ras gene stabilizes the Ras protein in a GTP - bound form , which is constitutively active and make the cells grow more rapidly .
Contrary to the activated Ras protein , p8 inhibits cell growth ( Figure 3 ) .
We looked whether the Ras --> Raf --> MEK --> ERK pathway was also involved in the regulation of p8 expression , and which step ( s ) were critical .
Figure 5 shown that expression of a mutated form of the Ras protein ( rasV12 ) in BxPc - 3 cells , which are wild - type for ras , resulted in decreased p8 mRNA concentration and protein level suggesting that the activated ras inhibits p8 expression .
Figure 6 shows that overexpression of Raf , but not of Raf301 ( a negative mutant of Raf ) , and of ERK also inhibited the expression of the p8 - CAT construct in Panc - 1 as well as in BxPc - 3 .
Finally , the MEK1 / 2 specific inhibitor U0126 [ 21 ] activated p8 mRNA expression in pancreatic cells whether they carry mutated ras ( Panc - 1 ) or wild - type ( BxPc - 3 ) .
Similar results were observed when expression of the p8 protein was monitored by Western blotting ( Figure 7 ) .
Activation of the JNK pathway down - regulates p8 expression in pancreatic cancer cells
c - Jun NH2 - terminal kinase ( JNK ) is another major MAPK pathway which converts extracellular signals into expression of specific target genes through phosphorylation and activation of transcription factors .
JNK activation has been implicated in various , often opposite cellular responses , such as cell proliferation , transformation and apoptosis .
As shown in Figure 8 , overexpression of JNK down - regulates the gene reporter activity of the p8 - CAT construct in Panc - 1 cells .
Similar results were found in BxPc - 3 cells .
Treatment of these cells with the JNK specific inhibitor SP600125 [ 22 ] up - regulates expression of the p8 mRNA and p8 protein ( Figure 9 ) .
These results show that the JNK pathway is involved in the regulation of p8 expression .
The p38 pathway up - regulates p8 expression in pancreatic cancer cells
The p38 signal transduction pathway also plays an essential role in regulating several cell functions including growth , response to inflammation , differentiation and apoptosis .
In fact , in pancreatic cancer cells , p38 is a strong inhibitor of proliferation [ 23 ] contrary to the Ras --> Raf --> MEK --> ERK and JNK pathways .
We therefore analyzed the putative role of the p38 pathway in regulating p8 expression in pancreatic cancer cells .
Figure 10 shows that over - expression of the plasmid encoding p38 significantly increases p8 - CAT activity in Panc - 1 as well as in BxPc - 3 cells .
Then , cells were treated with SB203580 , a specific inhibitor of p38 [ 24 ] , and p8 expression was measured .
p8 mRNA as well as the encoded protein were down - regulated after inhibition of the p38 activity ( Figure 11 ) .
These results indicate that the p38 pathway is a positive regulator of p8 expression in pancreatic cancer cells .
TGF beta - 1 up - regulates p8 expression in pancreatic cancer cells
The most prominent biological activity of TGF beta - 1 is its potent inhibition of cell growth in a wide variety of cell types including pancreatic cells .
TGF beta - 1 signals are sent through two types of transmembrane serine / threonine kinase receptors .
In fact , TGF beta - 1 binds and brings together the type I and type II receptors .
In the resulting complex , the constitutively active TGF beta - 1 type II receptor phosphorylates the type I receptor , which then plays a major role in transducing the signal to downstream components to affect gene expression through phosphorylation of SMAD proteins .
Phosphorylated receptor - regulated SMADs then form heteromeric complexes with the common partner SMAD4 .
These heteromeric complexes then move to the nucleus , where SMAD4 will bind DNA and contribute to transcriptional activation .
In general , pancreatic cancer cells present with defects in TGF beta - 1 signaling and are resistant to TGF beta - 1 - mediated growth suppression .
Since TGF beta - 1 and p8 are inhibitors of pancreatic cell growth we analyzed whether p8 could mediate , at least in part , the effect of TGF beta - 1 .
First , we found that treatment of Panc - 1 cells with TGF beta - 1 increased p8 mRNA levels and p8 protein as judged by Western blot ( Figure 12 ) .
Then , to confirm that overexpression is regulated at the transcriptional level , we analyzed the effect of some constructs expressing constitutively activated type I TGF beta receptor , dominant negative type II TGF beta receptor , a dominant negative of Smad4 and the wild - type Smad4 on the p8 - CAT activity .
As expected , the constitutively activated type I TGF beta receptor but not the dominant negative type II TGF beta receptor increased CAT activity .
Also , expression of the Smad4 , contrary to that of the negative mutant , induced p8 transcription ( Figure 13 ) .
Together , these results indicate that p8 is positively regulated by TGF beta - 1 .
Beside the Smad proteins , TGF beta - 1 also activates the p38 MAPK pathway in pancreas - derived cells , which may play an important role in TGF beta - 1 induced genes [ 25 ] .
Therefore , we analyzed the p38 - dependent effect of TGF beta - 1 on p8 transcription .
As shown in Figure 13 , inhibition of p38 activity with the SB203580 specific inhibitor decreased about 40 % the activity of TGF beta - 1 on the p8 promoter indicating that the effect of TGF beta - 1 on p8 promoter is mediated by both p38 - dependent and p38 - independent pathways .
Discussion
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the fourth leading cause of death from malignant diseases [ 26 ] .
The aggressive nature of the neoplasia , the lack of early detection , and the limited response to treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy contribute to the high mortality rate of the disease .
Therefore , a better understanding of the molecular mechanism leading to pancreatic cancer remains a major goal because it may help proposing strategies for earlier diagnosis and better treatment .
The most commonly altered genes in pancreatic adenocarcinoma are K - ras ( 75 to 100 % ) , p16INK4a ( 95 % ) , p53 ( 50 to 75 % ) and DPC4 ( 50 % ) [ 27 - 31 ] .
Whereas K - ras is a proto - oncogene all the others are tumour suppressor genes .
Additional genes have been found altered at lower frequency .
Panc - 1 and BxPc - 3 pancreatic cells were chosen for this study because they both express high levels of p8 ( Figure 1 ) and because they present with different mechanisms of transformation and genetic backgrounds , Panc - 1 being wild - type for Smad4 / DPC4 but mutated for K - ras and BxPc - 3 mutated for Smad4 / DPC4 and wild - type for K - ras [ 18 , 19 ] .
This work presents evidences that p8 inhibits the growth rate of pancreatic cancer - derived cells and that the intracellular pathways promoting cell growth down - regulate p8 expression whereas those promoting growth arrest up - regulate its expression .
Together , these results suggest that p8 is downstream of some cell growth regulators and therefore regulation of p8 expression or its activity could be used as a target for treating pancreatic cancer .
Silencing p8 expression was able to strongly promote cell growth in both cell types , Panc - 1 and BxPc - 3 , suggesting that p8 may act downstream of the ras - or Smad4 / DPC4 - dependent ways .
Also , we found that stimulating cell growth by the complex combination of growth factors contained in fetal calf:__entity__ serum down - regulated expression of p8 whereas , on the contrary , treating the cells with TGF beta - 1 , which promotes cell cycle arrest , stimulates p8 expression .
Therefore , p8 gene expression seems to be regulated in opposite directions by mechanisms promoting cell growth or cell cycle arrest .
It is interesting to note that while p8 expression is under the control of cell growth regulatory pathways such as Ras --> Raf --> MEK --> ERK , JNK , p38 and TGF beta - 1 , p8 can affect cell cycle progression , suggesting that p8 is a target for factors regulating pancreatic cell growth .
A mechanism by which p8 could regulate cell cycle progression in embryonic fibroblasts was previously proposed [ 11 ] .
In fact , p8 seems to take action upstream from cyclin - dependent kinases because the intracellular levels and activities of Cdk2 and Cdk4 are decreased when p8 is expressed .
Concomitantly , the cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitor p27 is expressed at a low level in p8 - deficient cells which may explain the increased activity of Cdk2 and Cdk4 .
The mechanism by which p8 regulates the intracellular level of those proteins remains to be determined .
However , because p8 is a transcriptional cofactor , it is possible that regulation of expression of these molecules takes place , at least in part , at the transcription level .
Interestingly , expression of p8 mRNA seems to be regulated in a cell type - and stimulus - specific manner since , for example , p38 can induce p8 expression in response to stress in fibroblasts [ 3 ] but not in renal mesangial cells treated with endothelin [ 13 ] .
In pancreatic cancer - derived cells p38 seems to play a major role since it is involved in p8 activation as judged by transient transfection assays and using a specific p38 inhibitor ( Figures 10 and 11 ) .
In addition , p38 is also involved in TGF beta - 1 - induced p8 expression because about 40 % of the TGF beta - 1 effect was abolished when p38 activity was specifically blocked ( Figure 13 ) .
On the other hand , ERK and JNK are inducers of p8 expression in mesangial cells treated with endothelin , but not involved in the activation of p8 in response to stress in fibroblasts [ 3 ] , and even repressors in pancreatic cells ( Figures 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 and 9 ) .
Finally , PI3 kinase is an inducer of p8 expression in both endothelin - mediated p8 activation in mesangial cells [ 13 ] and pancreatic cells ( data not shown ) .
Based on these observations , overexpression of p8 could be considered a possible goal for treating pancreatic tumours , in order to limit their growth .
However , we previously reported that p8 repression would prevent rasV12 / E1A transformed fibroblasts from evolving as tumours in nude:__entity__ mice:__entity__ [ 16 ] .
This apparent contradiction needs to be resolved before considering p8 as a target for treating cancer progression .
Conclusions
In conclusion ( see Figure 14 ) , we report in this paper that inhibition of p8 expression by an anti - sense strategy increases the growth rate of both Panc - 1 and BxPc - 3 pancreatic cancer - derived cells .
Moreover , ERK - and JNK - mediated pathways down - regulate p8 expression , whereas p38 and TGF beta - 1 pathways induce p8 expression .
Also , cell growth triggered by expression of a RAS mutated protein or by 10 % fetal calf:__entity__ serum induces down - regulation of p8 expression .
Together , these results indicate that p8 is an intracellular cell growth inhibitor and that it is oppositely regulated by growth - promoting or growth - inhibiting factors in pancreatic cancer - derived cells .

Pancreatic p8 - deficient cells
To silence p8 expression in pancreatic cells , we infected these cells with a retrovirus expressing human:__entity__ p8 in the antisense orientation .
The retroviral vector was constructed as follows : human:__entity__ p8 cDNA was subcloned in HindIII and XhoI restriction sites of the pLPC plasmid ( obtained from S . Lowe ) in the antisense orientation .
Amphotrope human:__entity__ p8 expressing retrovirus was then generated by transient transfection using Phoenix amphotrope packaging cells .
Viral supernatant was used to infect Panc - 1 and BxPc - 3 pancreatic cells and the population of p8 - silenced cells was isolated by selection in presence of puromycin ( 1 mu g / ml ) .
As control , cells were infected with the pLPC empty vector .
p8 expression in arrested and growing cells
One million of Panc - 1 or BxPc - 3 cells were cultivated on 10 - cm Petri plates in standard conditions ( with 10 % FCS ) .
After 48 h , culture media were changed for fresh media with FCS restricted to 0 . 1 % , in order to stop growth .
After 24 hours of growth arrest , culture medium was replaced either by medium with 10 % fetal calf:__entity__ serum to resume cell growth or , as control , by medium with 0 . 1 % fetal calf:__entity__ serum .
Twenty four hours later cells were recovered and RNA and protein extracted .
p8 expression in TGF beta - 1 - treated Panc - 1 cells
One million of Panc - 1 cells were cultivated in 10 - cm culture dishes for 48 hours under standard conditions before TGF beta - 1 treatment .
Human:__entity__ recombinant TGF beta - 1 ( 5 ng / ml ) was added to cells , without changing the culture medium , and cells were collected 12 hours later for RNA and protein preparation .

Phoenix amphotrope packaging cells ( 106 ) were plated in a 6 - well plate , incubated for 24 hours , then transfected with PEI with 5 mu g of retroviral plasmid .
After 48 hours , the medium containing virus was filtered ( 0 . 45 mu m filter , Millipore ) to obtain the viral supernatant .
Target BxPc - 3 were plated at 2 x 105 cells per 35 - mm dish and incubated overnight .
For infections , the culture medium was replaced by an appropriate mix of the viral supernatant and culture medium ( V / V ) , supplemented with 4 mu g / ml polybrene ( Sigma ) , and cells were incubated at 37 degrees C .
BxPc - 3 rasV12 - expressing cells were selected with puromycin ( 1 mu g / ml ) .
Cells infected with the pLPC empty vector were used as control .
Western - blot analyses
One hundred mu g of total protein extracted from cells was separated with standard procedures on 15 . 0 % SDS - PAGE using the Mini Protean System ( Bio - Rad ) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane ( Sigma ) .
The intracellular level of p8 was estimated by Western blot using a polyclonal antibody ( 1 : 1000 ) raised against human:__entity__ p8 [ 4 ] .
Growth curves
One hundred thousand cells per well were plated in a series of 35 - mm culture dishes .
The cell number was estimated daily in triplicate , during 1 to 5 days , in a haemocytometer .
Within experiments , each point was determined at least two times .
Cell transfection and gene reporter assays
Panc - 1 and BxPc - 3 ( 105 ) were cultivated in 30 mm diameter culture dishes for 24 hours then transiently transfected with 0 . 5 mu g of p8 - CAT reporter plasmid and 0 . 5 mu g of pCMV / beta gal plasmid ( to control transfection efficiency ) using the Fugene reagent in accordance with the manufacturer ' s protocol ( Roche Molecular Biochemicals ) .
The p8 - CAT plasmid is the previously reported p - 1471 / + 37p8 - CAT promoter construct [ 5 ] .
Reporter activities were measured as previously described [ 5 ] .
Briefly , cell extracts were prepared with the reporter lysis buffer ( Promega ) 24 hours after transfection and CAT activity was determined by the phase extraction procedure [ 32 ] and beta - galactosidase assay was performed essentially as described in Sambrook et al .
[ 33 ] .
CAT activity was normalized to beta - galactosidase activity .
Experiments were carried out in triplicate and repeated at least two times .
Expression plasmids ( 0 . 5 mu g ) were co - transfected with p8 - CAT and pCMV / beta gal plasmids as indicated .
RT - PCR analysis
RNA was extracted using the Trizol ( Life Technologies ) procedure .
Total RNA ( 1 mu g ) was analyzed by RT - PCR with the SuperScript (TM) One - step RT - PCR System and the Platinum Taq kit ( Life Technologies ) .
RT - PCR was performed using different numbers of cycles to verify that the conditions chosen were within the linear range .
The mRNA coding for p8 was specifically amplified with sense ( 5 ' GAAGAGAGGCAGGGAAGACA 3 ' ) and antisense ( 5 ' CTGCCGTGCGTGTCTATTTA 3 ' ) primers , in positions 72 and 643 of the cDNA ( accession # NM _ 012385 ) , respectively .
As control , the transcript coding for the ribosomal protein RL3 was specifically amplified for 22 cycles with sense ( 5 ' GAAAGAAGTCGTGGAGGCTG3 ' ) and antisense ( 5 ' ATCTCATCCTGCCCAAACAC3 ' ) primers , in positions 216 and 637 of the cDNA , respectively .

Abstract
The problem of reading DNA sequence films has been reformulated using an easily implemented , multiplex version of enzymatic DNA sequencing .
By utilizing a uniquely tagged primer for each base - specific sequencing reaction , the four reactions can be pooled and electrophoresed in a single lane .
This approach has been previously proposed for use with fluorescently labelled probes ( 1 ) , and is analogous to the principle used in four - dye fluorescence sequencing except that the signals are resolved following electrophoresis ( 2 ) .
After transfer to a nylon membrane , images are obtained separately for each of the four reactions by hybridization using oligonucleotide probes .
The images can then be superimposed to reconstitute a complete sequence pattern .
In this way the correction of gel distortion effects and accurate band registration are considerably simplified , as each of the four base - specific ladders require very similar corrections .
The methods therefore provide the basis for a second generation of more accurate and reliable film reading programs , as well as being useful for conventional multiplex sequencing .
Unlike the original multiplex protocol ( 3 ) , the approach described is suitable for small projects , as multiple cloning vectors are not used .
Although more than one vector can be utilized , only a library of fragments cloned into any single phage , phagemid or plasmid vector is actually required , together with a set of tagged oligonucleotide primers . Images

This approach has been previously proposed for use with fluorescently labelled probes ( 1 ) , and is analogous to the principle used in four - dye fluorescence sequencing except that the signals are resolved following electrophoresis ( 2 ) .
After transfer to a nylon membrane , images are obtained separately for each of the four reactions by hybridization using oligonucleotide probes .
The images can then be superimposed to reconstitute a complete sequence pattern .
In this way the correction of gel distortion effects and accurate band registration are considerably simplified , as each of the four basespecific ladders require very similar corrections .
The methods therefore provide the basis for a second generation of more accurate and reliable film reading programs , as well as being useful for conventional multiplex sequencing .
Unlike the original multiplex protocol ( 3 ) , the approach described is suitable for small projects , as multiple cloning vectors are not used .
Although more than one vector can be utilized , only a library of fragments cloned into any single phage . phagemid or plasmid vector is actually required , together with a set of tagged oligonucleotide primers .
INTRODUCTION
The community of biologists is undertaking the sequencing of representative genomes of various free - living organisms , ranging in size from Mycoplasma ( 800kb ) to mammals ( 3 Gb ) ( 4 ) .
However , the largest contiguous DNA sequences which have been determined so far are the genomes of several dsDNA eukaryotic viruses ( 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 ) and plant chloroplasts ( 10 , 11 , 12 ) .
The largest of these is the 229kb genome of human:__entity__ cytomegalovirus:__entity__ ( 8 ) .
The difficulty in sequencing millions of base pairs of DNA is that several steps in the methods are relatively labour intensive , although the sequencing reactions themselves are rapid and easily performed .
Two limiting steps in conventional procedures are the size fractionation of sequencing reaction products by gel electrophoresis and the subsequent reading of sequence ladders .
The former problem can be overcome by multiplexing , which theoretically allows an enormous amount of
data to be obtained from a single gel by processing clones as mixtures rather than individually ( 3 ) .
Each sequence in the mixture is labelled by a unique short oligonucleotide ' tag ' sequence .
This allows the mixture to be resolved following electrophoresis : the superimposed sequence ladders are blotted from the gel to a nylon membrane , and detected one at a time by hybridization using tag - specific oligonucleotide probes .
In practice , at least 50 sets of sequences can be obtained from a single gel ( 3 ) .
Unfortunately , a bottleneck in the multiplex procedure is the reading of sequence films .
In previous large - scale sequencing projects this task has been performed with the aid of a sonic digitizer ( 13 , 14 ) .
Although film reading programs have been under development for some time ( 15 ) , and some programs are commercially available , their error rates are presently more variable and unpredictable than that of a skilled person and the accurate interpretation of film - imaged sequence ladders by computer programs is difficult to achieve in routine practice .
Programs specifically designed to read multiplex films have an advantage .
This is because a sequence image can be used as an ' internal standard ' to help interpret other images derived from the same membrane ( 3 ) .
However , the original implementation of the multiplex strategy used chemical sequencing ( 16 ) , which yields a more complex sequence ladder than the enzymatic dideoxynucleotide chain - termination method ( 17 ) .
Most successful large scale sequencing projects have used the chaintermination method and bacteriophage:__entity__ M13:__entity__ vectors , which allows the routine production of clean and easily interpretable sequences ( 18 ) .
It was therefore decided to adapt the original multiplex protocol for use with enzymatic sequencing , using tagged primers .
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eight oligonucleotide sequencing primers were synthesized , each 37 nucleotides in length .
The 3 ' end of each primer consists of the 17 nucleotide M13 universal priming sequence [ GTAAAACGACGGCCAGT3 ' ] .
The 5 ' ends of the primers bear different 20mer tag sequences ( Figure 1 ) .
In four of the primers , UEO1C , UPOIC , UE02C and UP02C , these tags are complementary to the EO1 , PO1 , E02 and P02 probe sequences respectively ( copied from the original ' plex ' vectors ( 3 ) ) .
A second set of four primers , UJOL14C , UJOL15C , UJOL16C and UJOL17C , have the following tag sequences : 5 ' CAAGTTTGAAGGTACTCATT , TATCAATTAAATTGTllTGAC , GTGTTGCTACCCAAGAAGCA , and TGTCACTAGAGCTGTCACTT , respectively .

oligonucleotides were gel - purified ( 19 ) and used to sequence ssDNA templates prepared by phenol extraction ( 20 ) or SDS denaturation ( 21 ) .
Conventional sequencing reactions were performed as previously described ( 20 ) .
For hybridization experiments , radioactively labelled nucleotides were omitted from the sequencing reactions .
Instead , the 21d of each nucleotide mix added to the reaction mixture consisted of the following : ' A ' mix : 6 . 25MtM dATP , 62 . 5lM ddATP ; ' C ' mix : 6 . 25MM dCTP , 40MtM ddCTP ; ' G ' mix : 6 . 25MtM dGTP , 80MtM ddGTP ; ' T ' mix : 6 . 25MM dTTP , 250yM ddTTP ; as well as 125MM of each of the three other dNTPs in each mix .
Apart from the use of these modified mixes , no changes were made to the conventional sequencing procedure ( 20 ) .
Sequencing reactions were pooled and ethanol precipitated as appropriate .
Precipitation in microtitre trays was carried out as follows : a mixture of 3 . 2M1 3M NaAc pH 5 . 0 and 112Mi1 EtOH was dispensed to individual wells of a microtitre plate ( Falcon 3911 or Corning 25855 ) using an 8 - channel pipettor .
Each set of four reactions was added to the EtOH / NaAc mixture , and the tray sealed using a Falcon 3073 plate sealer .
The samples were mixed by inversion and stored at - 20 ? C for 30 minutes .
The DNA was collected by a 20 minute centrifugation at 4 000 rpm in an IEC Centra 3C centrifuge .
The sealer was removed , and the plate inverted to discard the supernatant .
After blotting the tray on tissue paper , 200MI of 95 % EtOH was added to each well .
The plate was covered with a plastic lid and recentrifuged for 2 minutes .
The EtOH was discarded and the plate inverted for several minutes on tissue paper , then left for 20 minutes to air dry .
Precipitated samples were resuspended in 6M1 deionized water by vortexing on an SMI multi - tube vortexer for 1 minute .
Samples were denatured and electrophoresed on 6 % polyacrylamide buffer gradient gels as previously described ( 20 ) .
Following electrophoresis , the gel was transferred to a dry piece of Whatman 3MM blotting paper , and placed on a second sheet of blotting paper supported on a glass plate and saturated in 4 x SSC ( SSC : 150mM NaCl , l5mM trisodium citrate ) .
This sheet was wicked in a tray containing 1 litre of 4 x SSC .
The DNA was transferred to a nylon membrane ( Amersham Hybond N ) by capillary blotting overnight ( 22 ) .
DNA was fixed to the membranes by U . V . crosslinking ( 23 ) .
Plex oligonucleotide probes were a kind gift of Dr . George Church .
Probes were tailed at their 3 ' ends using [ a - 32p ] dCTP as previously described ( 3 ) .
For the preparation of digoxigenin ( DIG ) labelled probes , identical tailing reactions were carried out substituting I0pmols of DIG - II dUTP ( Boehringer Mannheim ) for [ a - 32P ] dCTP .
Membranes were prehybridized for at least 10 minutes in 4 x SSC , 5 x Denhardts ' ( 0 . 1 % ( w / v ) each of BSA ( heated at 80 ? C for 30 minutes to inactivate any alkaline phosphatase activity ) , Ficoll ( Pharmacia ) and polyvinylpyrrolidone ) , 0 . 5 % ( w / v ) SDS , 5mM NaHPO4 ( 23 ) .
Hybridization was carried out in 25 - 50M1 of prehybridization buffer per cm2 of membrane .
The probe concentration was approximately lnM .
After lh at 42 ? C , unbound probe was removed by five 1 minute washes at room temperature in 1 x SSC , 0 . 5 % SDS ( 200MI / cm2 membrane ) .
Radioactive blots were covered in Saran wrap and exposed to film immediately .
Detection of DIG labelled probes used an anti - DIG antibodyalkaline phosphatase conjugate ( Boehringer Mannheim ) according to the manufacturer ' s instructions , except that all volumes were reduced by 70 % and the conjugate was used at a 1 : 10 000 dilution .
Blots were developed in 25M1 of 100mM Tris . Cl pH9 . 5 ,
mantane4 - methoxy4 ( 3 " - phosphoryloxy ) phenyl - 1 , 2 - dioxetane ) ; Tropix ) / cm2 for 30 minutes at 37 ? C , prior to exposure to film .
Probes and dioxetane were stripped from the membranes by two 10 minute washes at 700C with 0 . 2 % SDS , 2mM EDTA ( 200 , ul / cm2 membrane ) .
The hybridization and washing procedures were carried out in plastic bags .
However , washing steps have also been performed with gentle agitation in a perspex tub ( 43 x 27 x 15cm ) mounted on a reciprocal shaker , with equivalent results .
In the latter case a minimum wash volume of 500mls was used .
The use of a tub is more convenient for batch processing and should be straightforward to automate .
RESULTS
Autoradiograms revealed no difference in sequence quality when tagged primers were used instead of the 17mer universal primer in conventional [ a - 35S ] dATP labelled sequencing reactions and in multiplex hybridization experiments using [ a - 32P ] dCTP - tailed probes ( results not shown ) .
Experiments were then conducted to determine the feasibility of pooling the four base reactions for each clone and fractionating them in a single lane to obtain a superimposed but interpretable set of sequence ladders .
The question addressed was whether or not difficulties in band registration might arise as a result of mobility differences between the different primer sequences and / or distortion of the membrane between probings .
It is relevant that an automated film reader employing an internal standard requires that the nylon membrane does not undergo significant distortions between probings ( George Church , personal communication ) .
Clones were sequenced using the four tagged primers UEOlC , UPOIC , UE02C , and UP02C , one for each base reaction ( Figure 1 ) .
The A , C , G and T reactions for each clone were pooled , and processed as described above .
A complete set of sequence autoradiograms was obtained from four consecutive rounds of probing with [ a - 32P ] dCTP - labelled oligonucleotides .
Alignment of the films showed that sequence - specific mobility effects and distortion of the membrane between probings were sufficiently minor to allow accurate registration of the bands , and hence accurate reading of the sequence .
At least 200 nucleotides of sequence could be read accurately from a single clone by simply tracing the four sets of bands using different colours , overlaying the tracings , and reading the bands sequentially .
In order to assess the practicality of reading the sequences by machine , the images were scanned to provide optical density profiles ( Figure 2 ) .
These profiles were overlaid , and were found to be sufficiently in register to allow accurate interpretation of the sequence for at least 300 nucleotides .
This was essentially the limit of resolution of the gel for accurate manual reading .
In order to ensure that the relatively minor mobility differences observed between the four primers were not coincidental to the oligonucleotides used , a second set of four tagged M13 universal primers was synthesised , this time incorporating 20mer sequences derived from the genome of murine herpesvirus - 68 ( UJOL14C , 15C , 16C , 17C ) .
Sequencing reactions were performed using [ cx - 35S ] dATP to label the DNA directly .
Various templates were sequenced , and in all cases correctly ordered sequence ladders were obtained following conventional electrophoresis in which the four reactions were run side - by - side ( results not shown ) .
Initial hybridization experiments were conducted using [ f - 32p ]
dCTP tailed oligonucleotide probes .

Figure 1 . Approaches to enzymatic multiplex DNA sequencing . a ) A set of sequence - tagged vectors can be used .
The tag site is shown in red , and the insert to be sequenced in blue .
However , the original plex vectors ( 3 ) are plasmids , and therefore amenable only to dsDNA sequencing . Sets of bacteriophage:__entity__ M13:__entity__ vectors have been constructed bearing either one ( 32 ) or two [ Chee , unpublished ] of the plex tag sites flanking the polylinker , which can be used for this approach .
b ) The strategy used in this paper .
In this case the tag site is carried on the primer .
c ) If tagged primers are used , there is no practical impediment to performing each base reaction using a different primer , as depicted .
The reactions can then be pooled in any combination desired .
The configuration shown , in which the four reactions are electrophoresed in a single lane , is designed to facilitate accurate band registration and reading by an automatic film reader .
In order to read the sequence manually , base reactions would be run side - by - side .
The logistics of processing the reactions are essentially the same with either configuration ; the same number of probings are required .

specific reactions respectively .
Detection was by autoradiography following hybridization with [ a - 32p ] dCTP tailed plex probes .

Four separate base - specific reactions imaged from a single lane using chemiluminescent detection .
The clones sequenced are : a ) Bluescribe M13 + ( obtained by rescue with M13K07 helper phage ( 30 ) ) and b ) an M13 recombinant clone prepared in a microtitre tray ( 21 ) ( a kind gift of Victoria Smith ) .
Nucleotide positions shown on the figure are numbered from the start of the universal priming site .
The clones were sequenced using UEOlC , UPOIC , UE02C , and UP02C for the T , C , G and A specific reactions respectively .
The blot was probed with corresponding DIG - 11 - dUTP labelled oligonucleotides .
radioactivity on the scale envisioned for a large sequencing project is undesirable for reasons of safety .
The relatively long exposure times required ( 6 to 24 hours ) and the short half lives of the probes might also be inconvenient .
It has been shown that a biotin / streptavidin / alkaline phosphatase based detection system used in conjunction with a chemiluminescent dioxetane substrate overcomes these disadvantages ( 24 , 25 , 26 ) .
We utilized a different bridging system with similar results .
Digoxigenin ( DIG ) labelled oligonucleotide probes were detected using anti - DIG antibody - alkaline phosphatase conjugates and a chemiluminescent dioxetane substrate .
Exposure times of 10 to 15 minutes were typically required , following a one hour preincubation period ( Figure 3 ) .
In our hands the DIG bridging system was similar in sensitivity to the streptavidin based system ( 24 ) , and the practical lower limit of template ssDNA required in order to obtain an easily interpretable sequencing ladder was estimated to be in the range of 20 to 50fmols per reaction .
However , the sensitivity of detection was limited only by enzymaticallytriggered background luminescence , and not by the level of signal obtained .
The nonradioactive methods described have been used successfully in an 8 - plex system .
DISCUSSION
Although the original multiplex protocol was based on a set of tagged vectors ( 3 ) , tagged primers have also been used or proposed for various forms of multiplex DNA sequencing ( George Church , personal communication ; 2 , 27 ) .
For example , a proposal was recently put forward for multiplex sequencing using sequence - labelled primers and fluorophor - labelled probes
( 1 ) , similar in principle to the methods used here .
However , we use tagged primers and the superposition of the four sequencing reactions to address the problem of reading DNA sequence films ; a part of this solution is to utilize M13 dideoxynucleotide sequencing , thereby improving the quality of the data to be analyzed .
In addition , the proposal for fluorophor - labelled probes does not take into consideration any of the practical sequencing problems addressed here , and , in the version described , remains a promising but unproven scheme for large scale DNA sequencing .
There are several advantages to tagging primers instead of vectors .
Firstly , there is no need to prepare multiple libraries of clones in special vectors .
This means that workers can use vector / host combinations that yield good results in their hands , and an increased depth of multiplexing can easily be accomodated by synthesizing more primers .
This should make multiplexing more accessible to workers undertaking smaller projects .
A theoretical disadvantage of tagged primers is that the procedure can only be multiplexed following primer annealing ( 1 ) , or following the sequencing reactions ( this paper ; in practice , pooling immediately after the annealing step might lead to increased backgrounds if one or more primers were present in excess over their template DNAs ) .
This is a relatively late stage .
In the original procedure ( 3 ) , clones were pooled prior to amplification by growth , an early step .
However , we do not believe the sacrifice to be of practical importance when using phage vectors .
In our experience , recombinant M13 phage have variable growth rates and the effects of competition are likely to severely limit the number of clones that can usefully be pooled for growth .
In contrast , by growing clones individually , the depth of multiplexing is only really limited by probe sensitivity .
We have not investigated the factors influencing variability in phage growth rates .
It is worth noting that reliable protocols have been developed for growing large numbers of individual M13 clones and preparing high quality ssDNA templates in microtitre trays ( 28 , 21 ) .
It is relatively simple to prepare manually two microtitre trays of ssDNA templates ( 192 clones ) in a day .
Sufficient clones can be prepared in a week to sequence a 20kb fragment to a redundancy of 10 ( Victoria Smith , personal communication ) .
In this laboratory , ssDNA is now prepared with the aid of a commercially available robotic workstation ( 21 ) .
As sequencing reactions are also carried out in microtitre trays , manually or robotically ( 20 , 29 ) , the entire M13 - based dideoxynucleotide sequencing procedure is amenable to automation ( 29 ) .
For these reasons we see little practical advantage in pooling clones early .
Finally , by not pooling clones early , the ability to easily retrieve individual clones is retained , which may facilitate directed sequencing later in a project should this become necessary .
Multiplex DNA sequencing is currently limited by the lack of a robust computer program which can correct for the large variety of gel and sequencing artefacts that are normally encountered .
The foundation of a film reading program is the ability to bring into register precisely vertical arrays of base - specific bands .
This requires the ability to track lanes , correct for distortions , and order bands based on their relative spacing .
A method of sequencing which has successfully overcome the problem of sequence reading uses real - time detection of fluorescently labelled DNA samples migrating through the gel ( 2 ) .
This system also utilizes the principle of running the four base reactions down the same lane ( 2 ) .
However , bands are detected at a fixed location
in space , and their detection is separated in time .
Hence the

problem of gel distortion is essentially avoided , although corrections for the different mobilities of the four dyes must be carried out .
In contrast , we utilize the advantages of single lane electrophoresis to address the problem of superimposing four relatively large and complex two - dimensional images .
Furthermore , by using sequence - tagged oligonucleotides which are detected by hybridization , a much greater depth of multiplexing can realistically be achieved than by real - time detection .
The use of two - dimensional colour traces to depict the processed output of a film reader is consistent with the method of displaying fluorescence traces , and should facilitate the checking and editing of sequence databases in which both kinds of data have been entered .
The sequence compilation programs used in this laboratory , which are already capable of handling large shotgun databases ( 8 , 31 ) , have recently undergone extensive improvements ( Rodger Staden , personal communication ) .
There is now an interactive database editor which allows the graphical display of fluorescence traces , and it is envisaged that this feature could be extended to allow the handling of data from a film reader when a suitable machine is developed .

Mapping irradiation hybrids to cosmid and yeast:__entity__ artificial chromosome libraries by direct hybridization of Alu - PCR products .
Abstract
A direct hybridization protocol is described for screening cosmid and yeast:__entity__ artificial chromosome libraries with pools of Alu - PCR products from somatic cell or irradiation hybrids .
This method eliminates purification , cloning and analysis of each individual Alu - PCR product before library screening .
A series of human:__entity__ X chromosome irradiation hybrids were mapped by this method , using a cosmid reference library for comparisons between overlapping hybrids to identify interesting clones for further analysis . Images

ABSTRACT
A direct hybridization protocol is described for screening cosmid and yeast:__entity__ artificial chromosome libraries with pools of Alu - PCR products from somatic cell or irradiation hybrids .
This method eliminates purification , cloning and analysis of each individual AluPCR product before library screening .
A series of human:__entity__ X chromosome irradiation hybrids were mapped by this method , using a cosmid reference library for comparisons between overlapping hybrids to identify interesting clones for further analysis .
INTRODUCTION
The generation of human:__entity__ DNA probes specific for individual chromosomes and subregions of chromosomes has been advanced with Alu - sequence primed polymerase chain reaction amplification ( Alu - PCR , 1 - 3 ) .
This method specifically amplifies sequences between Alu repeats from human:__entity__ DNA in somatic cell hybrids and yeast:__entity__ artificial chromosomes ( YACs , 4 ) .
Individual Alu - PCR products can be purified from agarose gels or ligated into plasmid vectors to screen for single copy sequences .
Unique Alu - PCR products are then localized to certain chromosome regions using DNA blots of somatic cell hybrid panels .
Once localized , Alu - PCR fragments can be screened against genomic libraries to isolate longer DNA fragments from the region of interest .
As an alternative to this multistep process we have developed a hybridization protocol for screening of cosmid and YAC libraries directly with pools of Alu - PCR products .
Two new human:__entity__ specific Alu primers were used to generate DNA probes from a series of irradiation - reduced hybrids containing multiple human:__entity__ X chromosome fragments of 1 - 2000 kb on a hamster chromosome background ( 5 ; P . N . G . , unpublished ) .
The Alu - PCR products were hybridized as a pool of probes to X - specific cosmid and YAC libraries , after
competitive reassociation with an excess of human:__entity__ DNA to both the library filters and radioactively labelled Alu - PCR products .
Comparisons were made between clones identified by overlapping irradiation hybrids and single copy DNA probes hybridized to the cosmid and YAC libraries .
METHODS
Two human:__entity__ Alu sequence primers were generated which were shown to be human:__entity__ specific ; 3144 from the 3 ' end of Alu : 5 ' - GAGCGAGACTCCGTCTCAAA - 3 ' and 2729 from the 5 ' end of Alu : 5 ' - GTGGATCACCTGAGGTCAGGAGTTC - 3 ' .
All PCR reactions were carried out with 100 ng of hybrid DNA and 0 . 7 , ^ g of a single Alu primer in 100 d41 of 0 . 01 M Tris - HCl pH 8 . 3 , 0 . 0015 M MgCl2 , 0 . 05 M KCI , 200 AtM each of dNTPs , 10 % dimethlysulfoxide , and 2 . 5 units of Cetus Taq polymerase .
Reactions were 30 cycles of 94 ? C for 2 min , 57 ? C for 2 min , and 74 ? C for 4 min followed by a final extension time at 74 ? C for 9 min .
Reactions products were analyzed on 1 % agarose gels and shown to contain between five and twenty fragments , with sizes ranging from 0 . 1 to 2 . 0 kb .
Chinese:__entity__ hamster:__entity__ DNA and no DNA PCR reactions were done to control for non - human:__entity__ products ( data not shown ) .
Alu - PCR products were separated from Alu oligomers over Qiagen columns , and approximately 50 - 100 ng were labelled by random hexamer priming ( 6 ) .
The radioactively labelled pool of fragments was prehybridized with 37 . 5 , ^ g of total human:__entity__ DNA and 12 . 5 tsg of hamster DNA immobilized on a cellulose support matrix , prepared as previously described ( 7 ) .
Reactions were at 65 ? C in 1 ml of 0 . 75M NaCl , 0 . 05M sodium phosphate pH 7 . 2 , 0 . 005M EDTA , 0 . 1 % sodium dodecyl sulphate ( SDS ) , 0 . 5 mg / ml heparin , and 100 jig / ml denatured salmon sperm DNA .
The cellulose was pelleted and the supernatant boiled for 2 min every 12 - 16 hours ( three times in two days ) .
Cosmid and YAC library filters ( Hybond N + , Amersham ) were prehybridized at 42 ? C for 16 hours with 100 jig / ml

Figure 1 : A schematic diagram of the human:__entity__ X chromosome alongside the approximate cytogenetic location of fragments identified in nine irradiation hybrids ( numbers across the top ) .
The human:__entity__ X fragments were identified by hybridization of 27 known DNA markers ( indicated by a black line ; P . N . G , unpublished ) or by cosmids in common with unique X chromosome probes in the reference library database ( open boxes and Table 1 ) .
The size of the lines and boxes relate to the best cytogenetic location of the probes used according to Human Gene Mapping 10 . 5 ( 14 ) and does not indicate the physical extent of the irradiation hybrid fragments .
denatured and sheared total human:__entity__ DNA in 50 % formamide , 4XSSC , 0 . 05 M sodium phosphate pH 7 . 2 , 0 . 001 M EDTA , 10 % dextran sulphate , 1 . 0 % SDS , 50 isg / ml denatured salmon sperm DNA and OxDenhardt ' s solution .
The radioactively labelled Alu - PCR products were denatured and added to fresh
hybridization solution without human:__entity__ DNA competitor at 1 x 106
cpm / ml and hybridized at 42 ? C for 16 hours .
Filters were washed in 0 . 1 xSSC and 1 . 0 % SDS , twice at room temperature and twice at 65 ? C for 30 min each and exposed to Kodak X - OMAT film for 2 - 3 days at - 70 ? C with an intensifying screen .
For each hybridization , two sets of duplicate cosmid filters were used from the ICRF reference library system ( 8 ) , each containing 9216 flow - sorted human:__entity__ X chromosome cosmid clones or approximately 2 chromosome equivalents on a 22 x 22 cm filter ( 9 ) .
The coordinates of signals positive on duplicate cosmid filters were entered into the reference library database ( G . Z , unpublished ) using a digitizing tablet .
For the X chromosome specific YAC library ( A . P . M . and H . L . , unpublished ) , about 420 YAC colonies were spotted manually onto filters from 96 well microtiter dishes using a 96 prong device .
After growth on selective media for 3 days , YAC filters were processed for hybridization as previously described ( 10 ) .
RESULTS
A panel of 195 X chromosome irradiation hybrids was constructed ( 50 , 000 rads ) and characterized by DNA hybridization using 27 X chromosome markers and flourescence in situ hybridization using total human:__entity__ DNA as probe ( Benham et al . , 1989 ; P . N . G . , unpublished ) .
This analysis indicated that the hybrids contained multiple small fragments ( 4 - 10 fragments of 1000 - 5000 kb each ) with a preferential retaining of centromere sequences ( 90 % ) .
From this panel , nine irradiation hybrids were chosen that contained less than five different regions by DNA probe hybridizations , mostly from the short arm of the X chromosome ( Fig 1 ) .
All nine hybrids were used in PCR reactions with 3 ' - Alu primer 3144 and two were used with 5 ' - Alu

primer 2729 .
Example hybridizations to a human:__entity__ X chromosome cosmid filter in Fig 2 shows the intensity and reliability of positive clones identified on duplicate filters with Alu - PCR products from the same irradiation hybrid ( 48 ) and the independence of clones identified with Alu - PCR products from a different hybrid ( 54 ) .
Fig 3 shows a single positive YAC clone after hybridization of Alu - PCR products from irradiation hybrid 54 to a filter containing about 420 YAC clones specific for the human:__entity__ X chromosome .
The total number of cosmids identified with each pool of AluPCR products for each hybrid is shown in Table 1 .
From the average number of cosmids identified ( 24 ) in four chromosome equivalents screened and the estimated average DNA content in each hybrid ( 3000 - 15000 kb ) , the Alu - PCR products generated by a single primer were calculated on average to be 300 - 1500 kb apart , similar to published estimates for this method ( 1 , 2 ) .
Only 3 - 4 cosmids were identified in common using Alu - PCR products generated with either 3 ' or 5 ' Alu primers ( 3144 or 2729 ) from two hybrids ( 38 and 45 ) .
This shows that separate products were amplified with the two Alu primers since they prime synthesis from opposite ends of the Alu consensus sequence and Alu sequences are oriented in the genome either head to head ,

tail to tail or head to tail relative to each other .
Therefore , by using the 3 ' - and 5 ' - Alu primers in separate PCR reactions with the same hybrid DNA , the total number of products and cosmid clones identified was almost doubled .
Table 1 also indicates how many cosmids were identified by Alu - PCR products from other hybrids , and 16 cosmids previously identified with unique DNA probes in the reference library database .
As can be seen in Fig 1 and previous irradiation hybrid analysis , there is a preferential retention of centromere sequences ( 2 , 11 ) .
However , there were no cosmids identified in common from all the hybrids positive with centromere sequences .
This is probably due to a paucity of Alu repeats in the correct orientation in alphoid centromere sequences and thus few or no Alu - PCR products would be amplified from the centromere .
Cosmids identified in common by several irradiation hybrids ( Table 1 ) were most likely from regions of overlap outside the centromere area as shown by the previous DNA probe characterization ( Fig 1 ) .
The overlap regions between hybrids were also seen by 16 cosmids ( Table 1 , Fig 1 ) that were hybridization targets of unique DNA markers in the reference library database that mapped in independent experiments to the overlap region .
At least for several cosmids this showed that the Alu - PCR products identified target cosmids that were definitely from the expected region contained in the hybrids .
For example , hybrids 21 and 54 were both shown to contain part of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) locus ( Fig 1 ; P . N . G . , unpublished ) and had 11 cosmids in common , including one identified by the probe P20 from the deletion hotspot region of the DMD gene ( 12 ) .
In Fig 3 the hybridization of Alu - PCR products from hybrid 54 identified a YAC clone which was also positive for the DMD probe P20 ( data not shown ) .
This method also identified fragments in the hybrids that were not seen in the initial DNA characterization ( Fig 1 and Table 1 ) .
Since the 27 DNA probes were not close enough to each other along the chromosome to detect all possible hybrid fragments ( 1000 - 5000 kb ) , many regions would have been untested .
For example , AluPCR products from hybrids 45 and 48 identified several cosmids , also seen by the cDNA for chronic granulomatous disease gene ( CYBB , 13 ) in Xp2 1 . 1 , although this region was not tested in the original hybrid characterization .
DISCUSSION
The direct hybridization of Alu - PCR products from somatic cell hybrids to genomic libraries can bypass gel purification or ligation of fragments into plasmid vectors and individual analysis for single copy sequences .
Hybridization of Alu - PCR products as
a pool to ordered array libraries such as the flow - sorted X chromosome cosmid library ( 9 ) , allows the direct comparison of overlapping hybrids to pinpoint cosmids most likely to be from the region of interest .
In conjunction with the reference library database ( G . Z , unpublished ) with 183 X chromosome probe hybridization entries , cosmids identified with both Alu - PCR products and uniquely mapped X probes immediately map them to the region of interest and proove that the method has worked .
Similar hybridization experiments using Alu - PCR products from four overlapping irradiation hybrids identified four cosmids in common that mapped to the region of overlap by independent experiments ( F . Muscatelli , A . P . M . , P . N . G . , H . L . and M . Fontes , in preparation ) .
Since only 27 probes from the X chromosome were used to initially characterize the hybrids and the length of individual human:__entity__ fragments in the irradiation hybrids is about 1000 - 5000 kb , many regions could have been undetected in the original analysis .
The direct hybridization of Alu - PCR products to the cosmid reference library detected such fragments since they identified cosmids in common with uniquely mapped probes in regions not tested originally ( Table 1 and Fig 1 ) .
This should prove to be a sensitive and efficient method to determine content and overlap of irradiation hybrids in conjunction with DNA blot hybridization .
However , since the exact length of the human:__entity__ DNA fragments for each hybrid and the spacing of Alu - PCR products along the chromosome is not known , it is difficult to directly correlate the number of target cosmids to the DNA content of the hybrids .
The direct hybridization of Alu - PCR products from irradiation or somatic cell hybrids to total genomic YAC libraries will be especially useful to construct long range YAC contigs from specific subregions of chromosomes .
The dissection of a total genomic YAC library by this method may be more efficient than generating chromosome specific YAC libraries from somatic cell hybrids ( usually a haploid human:__entity__ chromosome on a diploid or greater rodent background ) or flow - sorted chromosomes , because of the low transformation efficiency of yeast:__entity__ .

ABSTRACT
Many species have been shown to contain tandemly repeated short sequence DNA kinown as minisatellites and simple sequence motifs .
Due to allelic variation in the copy number of the repeat unit these loci are usually highly polymorphic .
Here we demonstrate the presence of sequences in the genome of the nematode Caenorhabditis:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ which are homologous to two sets of short sequence DNA .
However , when two independent strains were compared no polymorphism for these sequences could be detected .
INTRODUCTION
The genome of many species , including lower organisms , contain minisatellite sequences and so - called simple sequence motifs ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) .
Due to extensive variation in the number of repeat units , many of these loci have been shown useful as polymorphic markers , e . g . for genetic linkage studies and identification purposes .
Here we demonstrate that the genome of the nematode Caenorhabditis:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ contains sequences that are homologous to the minisatellite core sequence 33 . 6 ( 1 ) and to the simple sequence motif ( AGC ) n .
Surprisingly , these sequences did not display polymorphism when two independent C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ strains , Bristol and Bergerac , were compared .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Genomic DNA from nematodes
Genomic DNA was isolated according to standard procedures from the two strains Bergerac ( BO ) and Bristol ( strain N2 ) .
These strains are derived from two different individual worms isolated in France and England , respectively .
Southern blotting
Genomic DNA digests ( 5 Ag ) were separated in a 1 % agarose gel in 1 x TAE ( 40 mM Tris . HCl , pH 7 . 4 / 20 mM sodium acetate / I mM NaEDTA ) by electrophoresis at 75 V for 16 h .
Separation patterns were transferred to Zetaprobe membrane ( BIORAD ) in 0 . 4 N NaOH , 0 . 6 M NaCl in a vacu - blot apparatus ( LKB ) according to the manufacturer ' s instructions .
The minisatellite and simple sequence probes used were prepared essentially as described ( 5 ) .
The Tcl probe is a plasmid containing an insert of the transposable element Tcl ( 4 ) .
All probes were labelled by random - priming .
Hybridization was performed for 12 h in 7 % SDS , 0 . 5 M phosphate buffer , 1 mM Na2EDTA at 650C .
Blots were washed twice in 2 . 5 x SSC at 650C and exposed to Kodak XAR - 5 film with intensifying screens .
Exposure times are indicated in Fig .

RESULTS
In Figure 1 the hybridization patterns are shown of C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ genomic DNA digested with Hae II , Rsa I and Eco RI , and subsequently hybridized to minisatellite core probe 33 . 6 , the simple sequence probe ( AGC ) n and Tcl .
The latter probe contains a member of the Tcl family of transposable elements which is present in different copy numbers in the two different strains ( 4 ) .
The hybridization patterns of probes 33 . 6 and ( AGC ) n obtained after Hae Im and Rsa I digestion and the differences in intensities of the hybridizing bands is reminiscent of DNA - fingerprint patterns obtained with these probes in other species ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) .
However , identical hybridization patterns for the two strains with the three enzymes tested indicated that in C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ these sequences are monomorphic ( Fig . 1 ) .
Based on the number of hybridizing bands we estimate the C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ genome to contain about 30 33 . 6 homologous loci and about 20 ( AGC ) n homologous loci .
Rehybridization of the same blot with a Tcl probe revealed extensive RFLPs due to the different copy number of the transposon in the two strains , a phenomenon which has been described previously by others ( 4 ) .
DISCUSSION
The findings presented in this paper indicate that polymorphism of minisatellite sequences and simple sequence motifs , is not a general phenomenon in animal species .
So far , only some species of whales have displayed similar high levels of monomorphism ( 6 ) .
In other species thus far tested both minisatellites and simple sequences display high to very high levels of polymorphism .
It should be noted , however , that at least in humans:__entity__ , a substantial part of the minisatellites detected by core probes also displays high levels of monomorphism as analysed by cloning ( 1 ) or by two - dimensional DNA fingerprinting ( 5 ) .
The fact that nematodes are hermaphrodites , and thus inbred , might be a contributing factor to the observed lack of polymorphism .
However , the high levels of polymorphism detected by the Tcl probe do not indicate a general absence of events causing genetic variation .
Indeed , Eide and Anderson ( 7 ) showed that tandemly repeated duplications in the unc - 54 gene of C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ revert at high frequencies .
Since in all cases the revertants had the normal genomic configuration this suggests that unequal crossing - over does occur in the nematode .
A more likely explanation for the monomorphic nature of the sequences detected with 33 . 6 and ( AGC ) n in C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ is selection against sequence variants at these loci .
This might be the result of the presence of a particular subset of minisatellites and / or simple sequences at sites in the genome of this organism , e . g . in coding sequences , in which variation in copy number of repeat units cannot be tolerated .
An example of such a coding sequence could be the High Mobility Group proteins which usually have stretches of identical ( acidic ) amino acids ( 2 , 8 ) .
An interesting observation in this respect is the demonstration of the absence of any protein polymorphisms in electrophoretic comparisons for 24 different enzymes between the Bristol and Bergerac strains ( 9 ) .
An important step in understanding this phenomenon will therefore be the isolation and analysis of individual homologous minisatellite and simple sequence loci from a genomic library of C:__entity__ .:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ .

How can Health Behavior Theory be made more useful for intervention research ?
Abstract
Background
The present paper expresses the author ' s views about the practical utility of Health Behavior Theory for health behavior intervention research .
The views are skeptical and perhaps even a bit exaggerated .
They are , however , also based on 20 - plus years of in - the - trenches research focused on improving health behavior practice through research .
Discussion
The author ' s research has been theoretically driven and has involved measurement of varying variables considered to be important theoretical mediators and moderators of health behavior .
Regretfully , much of this work has found these variables wanting in basic scientific merit .
Health Behavior Theory as we have known it over the last 25 years or so has been dominated by conceptualizations of behavior change processes that highlight cognitive decision - making .
Although much of health behavior practice targets what people:__entity__ do rather than what they think , the logic of focusing on thoughts is that what people:__entity__ think about is the key to what they will do in the future , and that interventions that can measure and harness those processes will succeed to a greater extent than those that do not .
Unfortunately , in the author ' s experience , the premise of cognitive theories has fallen short empirically in a number of ways .
The cognitive schemata favored by most health behavior theories are difficult to measure , they do not predict behavioral outcomes very well , there is little evidence that they cause behavior , and they are hard to change directly .
Summary
It is suggested that health behavior researchers reconsider their use of these theories in favor of models whose variables are more accessible to observation and experimental manipulation and that most importantly have strong empirical support .
Background
The author has been conducting research on behavioral treatment of obesity for about 25 years .
During that time , the dominant conceptual models guiding intervention development have been cognitive behavior models that have their origin in psychological theory .
Those most often cited include the Health Belief Model [ 1 ] , Protection Motivation Theory [ 2 ] , Subjective Expected Utility Theory [ 3 ] , the Theory of Reasoned Action [ 4 ] , Social Cognitive Theory [ 5 ] , and the Transtheoretical Model [ 6 ] .
All of these theories are concerned with how people:__entity__ make behavioral choices and the general idea is that people:__entity__ decide what to do based on the extent to which they expect that their choices will produce results that they value .
Much of the content of the theories is concerned with factors that may affect value / expectancy calculations .
As summarized by Weinstein in a comparative review of four social psychological theories [ 7 ] , variables thought to influence value / expectancy judgments include such factors as perceived rewards of current behavior , self - efficacy , normative beliefs , motivation , and the perceived consequences of not changing behavior .
Weinstein ' s summary is illustrative of the fact that Health Behavior Theory has tended to be particularly interested in understanding people:__entity__ ' s motivation to change behavior rather than ability to change .
Moreover , motivation is thought to be the result of a relatively complex , but logical , interpretation of large quantities of information about self and environment .
The theories that Weinstein reviewed deal almost exclusively with behavioral decision processes in people:__entity__ ' s minds .
They have few if any terms relating to how information gets into peoples minds or how subsets of it receive more or less attention .
Broader health behavior theories such as Social Cognitive Theory or the Transtheoretical model have addressed issues and variables outside the person:__entity__ to a greater extent , but the fundamental interest in and belief in psychological variables as the key force in determining health behavior remains .
The implications of the focus of health behavior theory on psychological determinants of behavioral decision - making for my own research area of interest , obesity treatment , are several .
One is the inclusion of measures of psychological characteristics in most research protocols ( e . g . , assessment of behavioral intentions , self - efficacy , perception of barriers to change , perception of social support , and outcome expectations ) .
A second is the inclusion of treatment elements that specifically target psychological perceptions and processes independent of the diet and physical activity behaviors that actually produce weight change ( e . g . , how to deal with emotional eating , how to deal with the frustration of lapses and relapses , and how to talk to yourself to increase self - motivation ) .
A third is the belief that psychological reactions to treatment experiences themselves are very important and deserve independent attention .
Common behavioral prescriptions for weight - loss goals and frequency of self - weighing are exemplary ( i . e . , recommending infrequent weighing to prevent discouraging feedback about progress and encouraging smaller and thus " more attainable " behavior and weight - loss goals in the belief that they will be more motivating ) .
The problem with the emphasis on cognitive variables in weight - control research is that they have so far failed to meet fundamental scientific criteria for empirical verification .
Thus , they also have not led to a better understanding of the weight - loss process , have not improved our ability to predict weight - loss outcomes , and have not led to improvement in treatment methods .
In some cases it is even arguable that they have made treatment worse .
I will illustrate these problems with results from my own research .
Discussion
Like most behavioral researchers in the obesity area , I have attempted to measure elements of health behavior theory in every obesity intervention project I have ever conducted .
I have assessed weight - loss goals , behavioral and weight - loss self - efficacy , psychological well - being , perceived barriers to diet and physical activity change , stages - of - change , and perceived social support .
How well have empirical examinations of these factors fared as predictors of success in weight control ?
Self - efficacy
We have examined the predictive value of self - efficacy assessments in several of our studies and describe the results from three of these here in more detail [ 8 - 10 ] .
In the first study , self - efficacy was assessed at baseline , posttreatment , and one year later in 85 men:__entity__ participating in a 15 - week weight - loss program [ 8 ] .
The self - efficacy instrument had subscales for emotional states ( e . g . , anxiety ) and situations ( e . g . , eating away from home ) .
Higher baseline self - efficacy on both subscales was associated with greater weight loss in treatment and at 1 - and 2 - year follow - up .
Emotional self - efficacy at posttreatment did not predict weight loss at 1 - or 2 - year follow - up .
Situational self - efficacy at posttreatment predicted weight loss at 1 - year but not 2 - year follow - up .
The second study examined mood and situational self - efficacy in 55 men:__entity__ and 58 women:__entity__ before and after a 16 - week weight - loss treatment with a 1 - year follow - up [ 9 ] .
Women:__entity__ had lower pretreatment self - efficacy than men:__entity__ .
Self - efficacy was predictive of weight loss and maintenance in men:__entity__ but not in women:__entity__ .
Change in self - efficacy over time was positively related to weight change in women:__entity__ but not in men:__entity__ .
The third study examined predictors of weight change over a 2 - year period in 460 men:__entity__ and 1172 women:__entity__ who received a low - intensity weight - loss intervention delivered through their HMO [ 10 ] .
The self - efficacy measure was the WEL questionnaire .
Men:__entity__ again were found to have higher baseline self - efficacy than women:__entity__ .
Self - efficacy did not predict weight change in men:__entity__ but was positively , though weakly , related to weight change at 6 months only in women:__entity__ .
Our overall conclusion from the analyses described above , as well as others not pursued in as great detail , is that self - efficacy is a weak predictor of weight loss and is inconsistent across study populations and gender .
It tends to increase with weight loss .
However , treatment - induced increases in efficacy are not predictive of longer - term weight - loss success .
Barriers to Adherence
We have also attempted to measure barriers to adherence to weight - control behaviors in many of our studies [ 11 - 14 ] .
The instruments used for this have typically been formatted similarly to efficacy questionnaires in that people:__entity__ are asked to indicate how difficult they find situational , knowledge , and motivational challenges to achieving diet and exercise changes .
The findings in these studies have been quite consistent .
Baseline assessments of perceived barriers to behavior change are not predictive of weight change .
Weight loss is associated with reported decreases in perceived barriers .
Treatment - induced change in perceived barriers are not predictive of future weight change .
In other words , barrier perceptions as we have measured them do not appear to have pragmatic significance .
Weight Goals
Goal - setting has long been of interest to health behavior theory and in recent years has attracted attention in weight - loss research when it was realized that most people:__entity__ who enter weight - loss treatments want to lose a lot more weight than is realistic given the potency of current weight - loss methodologies [ 15 ] .
When asked to describe weight losses they deem to represent " dream , happy , acceptable , and disappointing , " many individuals in treatment fail to reach even " disappointing " weight losses even though in objective medical terms the results are positive .
Based on the argument that failure to reach gratifying weight - loss goals leads to psychological distress that lowers weight self - efficacy and undermines weight - loss efforts , it has become popular to recommend counseling in weight - loss treatments specifically targeting the lowering of weight - loss goals .
The theoretical argument is that excessive outcome expectations undermine behavioral efforts .
We have now completed three sets of formal analyses examining whether weight goals are predictive of weight - loss success .
In one of these analyses the relationship between weight - loss goals , weight - loss goal attainment , and long - term ( 30 months ) weight - loss attainment and psychological well - being were assessed in 69 men:__entity__ and 61 women:__entity__ participating in an intensive behavioral treatment program [ 16 ] .
Results indicated that weight - loss goals were unrealistically high on average and that lower goals were more likely to be reached .
Nevertheless , weight - loss goals did not predict either short - or long - term weight losses and were not associated with elevated psychological distress .
Two more recent analyses we have conducted looking at weight - loss goals as predictors of success have produced similar results [ Linde JA , Jeffery RW , Levy RL , Pronk NP and Boyle RG , unpublished data [ 17 ] ] .
Weight - loss goals either did not predict weight loss at all or were slightly positively related to weight - loss success .
Perceived Social Support
Perceived social support is another psychological factor thought to influence health behavior decision - making .
We have measured social support in a variety of ways in our studies , ranging from single - item questions to multipaged assessments attempting to differentiate among informational , instrumental , and emotional support .
The results , unfortunately , have closely paralleled those we have seen with other assessments of barriers to adherence .
Assessments of social support prior to treatment do not predict weight loss .
Average reports of social support tend to parallel weight loss itself .
When people:__entity__ lose weight they report more social support .
When they regain , they report less .
In other words , perceptions of social support are not predictive of success in weight - loss treatments .
Frequency Weight Self - monitoring
Self - monitoring of health behavior is incorporated into many health behavior theories , usually as part of a person:__entity__ ' s assessment of achieved outcomes .
Although self - monitoring is usually considered a positive element in the adoption of health behavior , in obesity treatment frequent self - monitoring of weight has tended to be down - played or even discouraged on the grounds that disappointing results ( i . e . , less than desired weight change ) may undermine motivation .
This is another example in which health behavior theory may have indirectly led to incorrect treatment recommendations .
In weight - loss treatments , active discouragement of frequent self - observation of weight has become popular based on the premise that more frequent weighting will cause psychological stress and lower self - efficacy .
Recently , we have examined the relationship between frequency of self - weighing and body weight in both clinical and population samples and have found , somewhat to our surprise , that frequency of self - weighing is one of the strongest single predictors of body weight cross - sectionally , and change in the frequency of self - weighing is one of the strongest predictors of weight change [ Linde JA , Jeffery RW and French SA , unpublished data ] .
The direction of predictions , however , is opposite that derived from theory .
People:__entity__ who weigh themselves more weigh less and are more successful in losing weight .
Stage - of - Change
A final failure of current health behavior theory to prove useful in weight - control research is a recent examination of the relationship between a stage - of - change measure adopted from Prochaska and short - and long - term weight loss [ 18 ] .
Categories of precontemplation , contemplation , preparation , and action were defined based on questions about weight - loss intentions and recent weight - loss attempts .
Despite a large sample size , excellent follow - up rates , and well - measured objective outcomes , we were unable to demonstrate that staging algorithms recommended by proponents of the Transtheoretical Model could predict weight - loss outcomes .
Experimental Modification of Expectations
Our most recent effort to utilize health behavior theory in obesity intervention research is a study that attempted to examine the effectiveness of experimentally - induced outcome expectancies on weight loss [ Finch EA , Linde JA , Jeffery RW , Rothman AJ and King CM , unpublished data ] .
Obese men:__entity__ and women:__entity__ participated in an 8 - week weight - loss program with 18 - month follow - up in which they were assigned to one of two expectancy groups .
The optimistic group was told that focusing exclusively on the positive benefits of weight loss would be valuable in ensuring that they remained motivated in their weight - loss efforts and was given assignments during weekly group sessions and homework between sessions to reinforce this optimistic mindset .
A " balanced " expectancy group received the instructions that focusing on both the positive and negative aspects of weight loss , a balanced approach , would be most conducive to maintaining weight - loss motivation .
This group also received assignments to reinforce their message .
Results of this study indicated that the expectation induction was successful initially but difficult to maintain in the face of real weight - loss experience .
We were also unable to show that experimentally - induced expectations influenced weight - loss success .
Summary and Conclusion
To summarize the findings described above , I have had considerable difficulty over the last 25 years in confirming that the psychosocial variables favored by health behavior theory are of much value for obesity intervention research .
They do not predict weight loss well , either as mediators or moderators .
There is little evidence to support the idea that targeting them for intervention improves weight - loss outcomes .
It is , of course , arguable that the weak findings relating to health behavior theory variables are due in large part to methodological weaknesses , either in measurement tools and / or their frequency of measurement .
I would argue , however , that 25 years is long enough to wait for improved methods and that it is time to look elsewhere for variables that better predict weight - change outcomes and that , therefore , may form a better basis for improving future treatments .
Implication for Weight - Loss Treatment
Given the lack of success finding support for cognitive mediators of behavior change in weight loss , one might surmise that progress in improving weight - loss interventions over the last 20 years must have been dreary indeed .
Somewhat surprisingly , however , that is not the case .
In fact , the short - term ( 6 to 12 months ) success of weight - loss treatments has approximately doubled over that time and several variables have been identified that reliably enhance treatment outcomes .
It has been clearly shown experimentally that increasing treatment length [ 19 ] , prescribing low - energy intakes [ 20 ] , prescribing high - energy expenditure [ 21 ] , using a deposit contract and group - based reward systems [ 22 ] , and simplifying adherence to diet through meal substitutes [ 23 ] and exercise by providing exercise equipment [ 24 ] all improve initial weight loss .
From a theoretical perspective , however , one thing is noteworthy about these successful innovations .
Although not incompatible with health behavior theory , none of them are specifically derived from cognitive decision - making models .
Indeed , health behavior theory does not include variables like these in its models .
Where Do We Go From Here ?
The argument above about the practical limitations of many popular theories of health behavior is not meant to be a call to abandon theory .
Behavior scientists have amassed much useful information about the principles underlying human:__entity__ behavior that should be valuable for health behavior interventions .
Much is known about human:__entity__ perception , learning , motivation , and responsiveness to environmental opportunities and contingencies .
Health behavior intervention lies at the interface between people:__entity__ and their environment .
Interventionists change aspects of the environment ( cues , information , behavioral contingencies ) with the intention of producing changes in how people:__entity__ behave .
What is needed to advance health behavior intervention is theory that addresses relationships between modifiable aspects of the environment and behavior .
There is no doubt that cognitive processes are involved in these relationships .
However , the extent to which current theories capture this is questionable .
Data now available suggest that easily obtainable information about people:__entity__ ' s cognitive processes adds little to our ability to predict the results of interventions .
Thus , it may be wise to pay more attention to applied theories like classical behavior theory [ 25 ] , communications theory [ 26 ] , and learning theory [ 27 ] than to those coming out of the social cognitive traditions .
