Number of glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ in lymphocytes and their sensitivity to hormone action .
The study demonstrated a decreased level of glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ ( GR:__entity__ ) in peripheral blood lymphocytes from hypercholesterolemic subjects , and an elevated level in patients with acute myocardial infarction .
In the lymphocytes with a high GR:__entity__ number , dexamethasone inhibited [ 3H ] -thymidine and [ 3H ] -acetate incorporation into DNA and cholesterol , respectively , in the same manner as in the control cells .
On the other hand , a decreased GR:__entity__ number resulted in a less efficient dexamethasone inhibition of the incorporation of labeled compounds .
These data showed that the sensitivity of lymphocytes to glucocorticoids changed only with a decrease of GR:__entity__ level .
[ 1:__entity__ ,:__entity__ 25-Dihydroxyvitamin:__entity__ D3:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ in lymphocytes and T- and B-lymphocyte count in patients with glomerulonephritis ]
Content of receptors to hormonal form of vitamin D3 , 1.25 ( OH ) 2D3 , constituted 27.3 fmole/mg of protein in lymphocytes of peripheric blood of children with glomerulonephritis .
In the patients concentration of total and ionized form of Ca2+ was decreased down to 2.04 mmole/L and 1.09 mmole/L , respectively , while an increase in parathormone ( PTH ) by 36 % and a distinct decrease in 25 ( OH ) D concentration ( lower than 1.25 ng/ml ) was found in blood ; content of cAMP was also decreased in lymphocytes by 33 % .
At the same time , total content of T lymphocytes was decreased 1.5-fold in peripheric blood .
Treatment with I-hydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1-1.5 mg daily , within 4 weeks ) led to normalization of total and ionized form of Ca2+ and of 25 ( OH ) D , but did not affect the PTH content in blood .
Concentration of the receptors:__entity__ to 1.25 ( OH ) 2D3 was elevated up to 39.7 fmole/mg after I week of the treatment , whereas it was decreased to the initial level 24.8 fmole/mg within 4 weeks ; simultaneous alteration in the cAMP content was observed in lymphocytes .
Treatment with 1- ( OH ) D3 normalized also the T lymphocytes content in peripheric blood .
The data obtained suggest that under conditions of glomerulonephritis only high content of receptors:__entity__ to 1.25 ( OH ) 2D3 in lymphocytes enabled to perform the cell response to the hormone effect .
Tumor and serum beta-2-microglobulin expression in women with breast cancer .
To investigate whether the tumor expression of beta-2-microglobulin:__entity__ ( beta:__entity__ 2-M:__entity__ ) could serve as a marker of tumor biologic behavior , the authors studied specimens of breast carcinomas from 60 consecutive female patients .
Presence of beta:__entity__ 2-M:__entity__ was analyzed by immunohistochemistry .
No significant correlations were found between tumor:__entity__ beta:__entity__ 2-M:__entity__ expression and several histologic attributes such as type , histologic and nuclear grades , mitotic index , necrosis , vascular invasion , and lymphocytic infiltration .
Likewise , beta:__entity__ 2-M:__entity__ was not associated with markers of disease extension such as TNM , ( UICC , classification of malignant tumors ) staging and axillary lymph node involvement or with estrogen , progesterone , and glucocorticoid receptor levels .
However , there was a significantly positive association between tumor:__entity__ beta:__entity__ 2-M:__entity__ expression and the degree of lymphocytic infiltration in the tumor tissue .
Beta:__entity__ 2-M:__entity__ serum levels were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in samples from 22 of the above women .
Although some of the highest values had been obtained in women with larger ( T4 ) primary tumors , the authors failed to detect any statistical relationship between beta:__entity__ 2-M:__entity__ expression in the tumor with serum levels or between serum:__entity__ beta:__entity__ 2-M:__entity__ and the above histologic , laboratory , and clinical factors .
[ Preliminary observation of level free-form:__entity__ E:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ levels in serum of normal childbearing-aged and pregnant women ]
In 137 cases of childbearing-aged and pregnant women , free:__entity__ form:__entity__ E:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ levels ( sE:__entity__ ) in serum were measured by ELISA .
The level of sE:__entity__ was significantly decreased during the first trimester , slightly higher in the second trimester , and recovered to normal in the third trimester .
The level remained lower in 29 PIH women but appeared higher in overdue pregnancies as compared with the normal 3rd trimester range .
The results indicate that there is a relationship between a change in T cell function and pregnancy .
Kappa:__entity__ B-specific:__entity__ DNA:__entity__ binding:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ : role in the regulation of human:__entity__ interleukin-2:__entity__ gene:__entity__ expression .
Transcriptional activation of the human:__entity__ interleukin-2:__entity__ (:__entity__ IL-2:__entity__ ):__entity__ gene:__entity__ , like induction of the IL-2:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ (:__entity__ IL-2R:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ ):__entity__ gene:__entity__ and the type 1 human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV-1 ) , is shown to be modulated by a kappa:__entity__ B-like:__entity__ enhancer:__entity__ element:__entity__ .
Mutation of a kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ core:__entity__ sequence:__entity__ identified in the IL-2:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ ( -206 to -195 ) partially inhibits both mitogen- and HTLV-I Tax-mediated activation of this transcription:__entity__ unit:__entity__ and blocks the specific binding of two inducible:__entity__ cellular:__entity__ factors:__entity__ .
These kappa:__entity__ B-specific:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ ( 80 to 90 and 50 to 55 kilodaltons ) similarly interact with the functional kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ enhancer:__entity__ present in the IL-2R:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ .
These data suggest that these kappa:__entity__ B-specific:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ have a role in the coordinate regulation of this growth factor-growth factor receptor gene system that controls T cell proliferation .
Novel region within the V:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ gene:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ is responsible for tissue and stage-specific expression of immunoglobulin:__entity__ genes:__entity__ in human lymphoid neoplasms .
Immunoglobulin:__entity__ gene-specific:__entity__ transacting:__entity__ factors:__entity__ have been shown to play a role in lymphoid tissue-specific expression of immunoglobulin:__entity__ genes:__entity__ .
The role of these factors in B-cell differentiation and stage-specific expression of these genes is , however , not fully understood .
We have used a model of human lymphoid neoplasia to address this question .
Different fragments of unrearranged:__entity__ human:__entity__ variable:__entity__ region:__entity__ of immunoglobulin:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ gene:__entity__ ( V:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ ) were used for cell-free in vitro transcription and DNA mobility shift assays .
Previously described enhancement of in vitro transcription that was only seen with nuclear extracts derived from B-cell neoplasms corresponding to the late stages of B-cell differentiation was shown to be dependent on the actions of these factor ( s ) on the DNA region within the V:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ gene:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ .
This region is located within the 920 bp fragment located 210 bp upstream from the coding region and this fragment represents a possible novel DNA region , which plays a role in the stage- and tissue-specific expression of immunoglobulin:__entity__ genes:__entity__ .
[ Determination of the sensitivity to glucocorticoids:__entity__ in vitro ]
A modified method for the determination of glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ in human lymphocytes is suggested .
The principal distinction of the method is standardization by the lymphocyte count in a sample ( 1 mln ) and the labeled hormone:__entity__ concentration .
The modification saves time and money , limits the range of the data variations , and makes use of a lesser volume of blood .
Examinations of 70 children aged 4 to 15 suffering from the nephrotic form of glomerulonephritis have made it possible to distinguish two groups of patients : with relatively high values of specific binding X = 6820.1 +/- 530.0 ( n = 30 , p = 0.95 , t = 2.04 ) , this corresponding to a clinical form of hormone:__entity__ -sensitive glomerulonephritis , and with relatively low values of specific binding X = 1815.2 +/- 302.8 ( n = 40 , p = 0.95 , t = 1.96 ) , that corresponds to hormone:__entity__ -resistant glomerulonephritis .
Dynamic studies have not shown any statistically significant changes in the specific binding values .
These results permit regarding the specific binding value as a prognostic criterion in the assessment of corticosteroid:__entity__ therapy ; this allows a wide employment of the described method in practical nephrology .
Octamer-binding:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ from B or HeLa cells stimulate transcription of the immunoglobulin:__entity__ heavy-chain:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ in vitro .
The B-cell -type specificity of the immunoglobulin:__entity__ ( Ig:__entity__ ) heavy-chain and light-chain promoters is mediated by an octanucleotide:__entity__ (:__entity__ OCTA:__entity__ ):__entity__ element:__entity__ , ATGCAAAT , that is also a functional component of other RNA:__entity__ polymerase:__entity__ II:__entity__ promoters:__entity__ , such as snRNA and histone H2B promoters .
Two nuclear:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ that bind specifically and with high affinity to the OCTA:__entity__ element:__entity__ have been identified .
NF-A1:__entity__ is present in a variety of cell types , whereas the presence of NF-A2:__entity__ is essentially confined to B cells , leading to the hypothesis that NF-A2:__entity__ activates cell-type-specific transcription of the Ig:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ and NF-A1:__entity__ mediates the other responses of the OCTA:__entity__ element:__entity__ .
Extracts of the B-cell line , BJA-B , contain high levels of NF-A2:__entity__ and specifically transcribe Ig:__entity__ promoters:__entity__ .
In contrast , extracts from HeLa cells transcribed the Ig:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ poorly .
Surprisingly , addition of either affinity-enriched NF-A2 or NF-A1 to either a HeLa extract or a partially purified reaction system specifically stimulates the Ig:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ .
This suggests that the constitutive OCTA-binding:__entity__ factor:__entity__ NF-A1:__entity__ can activate transcription of the Ig:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ and that B-cell -specific transcription of this promoter , at least in vitro , is partially due to a quantitative difference in the amount of OCTA-binding:__entity__ protein:__entity__ .
Because NF-A1:__entity__ can stimulate Ig:__entity__ transcription , the inability of this factor to activate in vivo the Ig:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ to the same degree as the snRNA:__entity__ promoters:__entity__ probably reflects a difference in the context of the OCTA:__entity__ element:__entity__ in these two types of promoters:__entity__ .
Identification of a putative regulator of early:__entity__ T:__entity__ cell:__entity__ activation:__entity__ genes:__entity__ .
Molecules involved in the antigen receptor-dependent regulation of early:__entity__ T:__entity__ cell:__entity__ activation:__entity__ genes:__entity__ were investigated with the use of functional sequences of the T:__entity__ cell:__entity__ activation-specific:__entity__ enhancer:__entity__ of interleukin-2:__entity__ ( IL-2:__entity__ ) .
One of these sequences forms a protein complex , NFAT-1:__entity__ , specifically with nuclear extracts of activated T cells .
This complex appeared 10 to 25 minutes before the activation of the IL-2:__entity__ gene:__entity__ .
Studies with inhibitors of protein synthesis indicated that the time of synthesis of the activator of the IL-2:__entity__ gene:__entity__ in Jurkat T cells corresponds to the time of appearance of NFAT-1:__entity__ .
NFAT-1:__entity__ , or a very similar protein , bound functional sequences of the long:__entity__ terminal:__entity__ repeat:__entity__ ( LTR:__entity__ ) of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ; the LTR:__entity__ of this virus is known to be stimulated during early T cell activation .
The binding:__entity__ site:__entity__ for this complex activated a linked promoter after transfection into antigen receptor-activated T cells but not other cell types .
These characteristics suggest that NFAT-1:__entity__ transmits signals initiated at the T:__entity__ cell:__entity__ antigen:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ .
Characterization of thyroid:__entity__ hormone:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ in human IM-9 lymphocytes .
Although putatively identified more than 10 years ago , thyroid:__entity__ hormone:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ in human tissues remain poorly characterized .
As a first step towards understanding the mechanism of thyroid hormone action in man we have characterized T3:__entity__ binding:__entity__ sites:__entity__ in nuclei of the human lymphoblastoid line , IM-9 cells .
In whole cell experiments at 37 degrees C , nuclear binding of [:__entity__ 125I:__entity__ ]:__entity__ T3:__entity__ was saturable ( Kd 34 +/- 6 pmol/l ) and of finite capacity ( approximately equal to 350 sites/cell ) .
The binding:__entity__ sites:__entity__ were extracted from a nuclear pellet by treatment with 0.4 mol/l KCl and sonication .
Separation of bound from free [:__entity__ 125I:__entity__ ]:__entity__ T3:__entity__ in the extracts was achieved using the calcium phosphate matrix , hydroxyapatite at a concentration of 0.3 ml of a 150 g/l slurry .
Rectilinear Scatchard plots were obtained only when the hydroxyapatite was washed with a buffer containing 0.5 % Triton X-100 .
Under these conditions T3:__entity__ binding:__entity__ sites:__entity__ in the nuclear extracts were present at a concentration of 22.4 +/- 8.6 fmol/mg protein and showed an affinity of ( Kd , room temperature ) 140 +/- 10 pmol/l .
The same assay system was used to determine the hierarchy of affinities for a range of natural and synthetic analogues .
Calling T3 100 , the order of potencies observed was : Triac , 500 ; 3 , 5-diiodo-3'-isopropylthyronine , 89 ; T4 , 32 ; 3 , 5-dimethyl-3'isopropylthyronine 2 ; 3 , 5-T2 , 0.7 , rT3 , 0.4 ; 3'5'-T2 , less than 0.01 .
These results suggest that the T3:__entity__ binding:__entity__ sites:__entity__ present in human IM-9 lymphocyte nuclei and extracts thereof are thyroid:__entity__ hormone:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ .
These cells may be a useful tool to increase our understanding of human:__entity__ T3:__entity__ receptors:__entity__
Definition of T-cell:__entity__ specific:__entity__ DNA-binding:__entity__ factors:__entity__ that interact with a 3'-silencer:__entity__ in the CD4+:__entity__ T-cell:__entity__ gene:__entity__ Rpt-1:__entity__ .
Analysis of the region 3 ' to the CD4+:__entity__ T-cell:__entity__ gene:__entity__ Rpt-1:__entity__ ( encoding regulatory protein T-lymphocyte:__entity__ 1:__entity__ ) led to the definition of a silencer:__entity__ element:__entity__ that inhibits heterologous:__entity__ gene:__entity__ expression in certain CD4+ T-cell lines but not in B-cell or non-lymphoid cell lines .
Functional silencer:__entity__ activity in vivo was associated with the presence of a specific silencer-DNA-protein:__entity__ complex:__entity__ in electrophoretic mobility shift assays with T-cell extracts .
Formation of this complex was selectively inhibited by the region in HIV-1:__entity__ containing a silencer:__entity__ element:__entity__ .
We discuss the possibility that DNA-binding:__entity__ factors:__entity__ may coregulate HIV-1 and Rpt-1 gene expression through a common transcriptional:__entity__ silencer:__entity__ element:__entity__ .
Congenital immunodeficiencies associated with absence of HLA:__entity__ class:__entity__ II:__entity__ antigens:__entity__ on lymphocytes result from distinct mutations in trans-acting:__entity__ factors:__entity__ .
Coordinate regulation of HLA:__entity__ class:__entity__ II:__entity__ gene:__entity__ expression during development and coinduction of class:__entity__ II:__entity__ genes:__entity__ by soluble:__entity__ factors:__entity__ suggests that common trans-acting:__entity__ factor:__entity__ ( s ) control expression of these genes .
In B-lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from two independent class II-deficient bare lymphocyte syndrome patients , we observed a drastic decrease in transcription rates of the class:__entity__ II:__entity__ genes:__entity__ .
When these cell lines are fused , class:__entity__ II:__entity__ genes:__entity__ are reexpressed , indicating that immunodeficiencies in bare lymphocyte syndrome patients are the result of two distinct mutations .
Further studies show that genes governing the expression of class:__entity__ II:__entity__ antigens:__entity__ fall into at least three complementation groups ; two of these were previously unidentified in mutant cell lines generated in vitro .
In addition , we report the identification of two discrete complexes , NFX1.1:__entity__ and NFX1.2:__entity__ , that bind to the DRA:__entity__ X:__entity__ consensus:__entity__ element:__entity__ .
Though the mutation in at least one mutant line generated in vitro ( RJ2.2.5 ) affects products functioning via interaction with the X:__entity__ box:__entity__ , clear alterations in either NFX1.1:__entity__ or NFX1.2:__entity__ are not found in any of the mutant cell lines .
In vivo responsiveness to glucocorticoid correlated with glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ content in peripheral blood leukocytes in normal humans .
Dexamethasone loading tests ( 0.1 mg dexamethasone/kg , iv ) were performed in 18 normal males to evaluate the individual responsiveness to glucocorticoid .
There were inter-individual differences in increase in peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocyte count , decrease in peripheral blood lymphocyte count , and increase in plasma free fatty acids levels after dexamethasone injection .
In addition , there was a significant correlation between the maximum increase in polymorphonuclear leukocytes and the maximum decrease in lymphocytes ( r = 0.7514 , p less than 0.0003 ) .
Simultaneous measurements of glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ content by whole-cell assay revealed that glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ content in polymorphonuclear leukocytes linearly correlated with that in the corresponding lymphocytes ( r = 0.9482 , p less than 0.0001 ) .
There were also significant correlations between the maximum increase in polymorphonuclear leukocytes and glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ content in polymorphonuclear leukocytes ( r = 0.7239 , p less than 0.0007 ) , and between the maximum decrease in lymphocytes and glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ content in lymphocytes ( r = 0.7703 , p less than 0.0002 ) .
These results suggest that individual differences are preserved both in glucocorticoid responsiveness and in glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ content in peripheral blood leukocytes in normal humans .
Estradiol receptors in the cytosol of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in hepatitis B virus carriers treated with interferon-alpha:__entity__ .
Estradiol:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ in the cytosol of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the effects of interferon-alpha:__entity__ ( IFN-alpha:__entity__ ) on estradiol:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ were studied in asymptomatic hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) carriers , patients with chronic hepatitis B and normal controls .
The level of estradiol:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ in the cytosol of mononuclear cells was significantly lower in asymptomatic HBV carriers and patients with chronic hepatitis B , compared to normal controls .
This low level of cytosol estradiol:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ in patients with chronic hepatitis B was increased by the administration of IFN-alpha:__entity__ .
In addition , when peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with chronic hepatitis B were incubated with IFN-alpha:__entity__ in vitro , the level of cytosol estradiol:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ also increased by increasing the concentration of IFN-alpha:__entity__ .
We previously reported that the response of mononuclear cells to estrogen is impaired in HBV carriers , and our present results suggested that this may be due to the low level of estradiol:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ in the cytosol of mononuclear cells .
Association of increased lytic effector cell function with high estrogen:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ levels in tumor-bearing patients with breast cancer .
Tumor-bearing patients with breast cancer were assayed for their natural killer ( NK ) cell activity and for the function of activated cytotoxic T-cells , as assessed by lectin-dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( LDCC ) .
Tumor-bearing patients with breast cancer had a significant increase in NK activity and in LDCC , as compared with healthy control individuals .
Although the enhanced NK cell activity and LDCC were closely associated with high levels ( greater than 31 fmol/mg ) of estrogen:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ ( ER:__entity__ ) content in the primary tumor , no other clinical or histologic correlation between the increase in either parameter of cytotoxic effector cell function could be found .
Thus , ER:__entity__ levels greater than 31 fmol/mg might be associated with increased cytotoxic effector cell function in tumor-bearing patients with breast cancer .
Properties of glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ in Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphocytes from patients with familial cortisol resistance .
In a previous report of two patients with familial glucocorticoid resistance due to reduced numbers of glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ ( GR:__entity__ ) , we have shown decreased numbers of GR:__entity__ in peripheral mononuclear cells and cultured fibroblasts but normal affinity of GR:__entity__ in both patients .
In this study , peripheral lymphocytes from these patients , one patient 's son and daughter , and normal subjects were transformed with Epstein-Barr virus .
Reduced numbers and normal affinity of GR:__entity__ were found in the Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphocytes from both patients while the son and daughter had normal numbers and affinity of GR:__entity__ .
The thermal stability of GR:__entity__ and thermal activation of cytosolic:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ in both patients were found to be normal .
Although the percentages of nuclear bound GR:__entity__ were similar in both patients and normal controls , the absolute amounts of nuclear bound GR:__entity__ of the patients were about one-half that of normal controls .
These abnormal properties of GR:__entity__ ( reduced numbers of GR:__entity__ ) were preserved in the transformed cells from the patients .
Octamer transcription factors 1 and 2 each bind to two different functional:__entity__ elements:__entity__ in the immunoglobulin:__entity__ heavy-chain:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ .
Immunoglobulin:__entity__ heavy-chain:__entity__ genes:__entity__ contain two conserved:__entity__ sequence:__entity__ elements:__entity__ 5 ' to the site of transcription initiation : the octamer ATGCAAAT and the heptamer CTCATGA .
Both of these elements are required for normal:__entity__ cell-specific:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ function .
The present study demonstrates that both the ubiquitous:__entity__ and:__entity__ lymphoid-cell-specific:__entity__ octamer:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ ( OTF-1:__entity__ and OTF-2:__entity__ , respectively ) interact specifically with each of the two conserved:__entity__ sequence:__entity__ elements:__entity__ , forming either homo-:__entity__ or:__entity__ heterodimeric:__entity__ complexes:__entity__ .
This was surprising , since the heptamer and octamer sequence motifs bear no obvious similarity to each other .
Binding of either factor to the octamer:__entity__ element:__entity__ occurred independently .
However , OTF:__entity__ interaction with the heptamer:__entity__ sequence:__entity__ appeared to require the presence of an intact octamer motif and occurred with a spacing of either 2:__entity__ or:__entity__ 14:__entity__ base:__entity__ pairs:__entity__ between the two elements , suggesting coordinate binding resulting from protein-protein interactions .
The degeneracy in sequences recognized by the OTFs:__entity__ may be important in widening the range over which gene expression can be modulated and in establishing cell type specificity .
Identification of a novel lymphoid:__entity__ specific:__entity__ octamer:__entity__ binding:__entity__ protein:__entity__ ( OTF-2B:__entity__ ) by proteolytic clipping bandshift assay ( PCBA ) .
The octamer sequence ATGCAAAT is found in the promoters of immunoglobulin:__entity__ (:__entity__ Ig:__entity__ ):__entity__ heavy:__entity__ and:__entity__ light:__entity__ chain:__entity__ genes:__entity__ and in the heavy:__entity__ chain:__entity__ enhancer:__entity__ and is a major determinant of the cell type specific expression of Ig:__entity__ genes:__entity__ in B cells .
An apparent paradox is that the same sequence serves as an upstream:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ or:__entity__ enhancer:__entity__ element:__entity__ in a variety of housekeeping:__entity__ genes:__entity__ such as the histone:__entity__ H2B:__entity__ and:__entity__ U:__entity__ snRNA:__entity__ genes:__entity__ .
The differential usage of this regulatory sequence motif is thought to be mediated by different species of octamer:__entity__ binding:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ .
One species of 100 kd , designated OTF-1:__entity__ , is present in all cell types and may exert its activating function only when it can interact with additional adjacent transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ .
The lymphoid:__entity__ cell:__entity__ specific:__entity__ octamer:__entity__ binding:__entity__ protein:__entity__ of 60 kd ( OTF-2A:__entity__ ) specifically stimulates Ig:__entity__ promoters:__entity__ which consist essentially of a TATA-box:__entity__ and an octamer:__entity__ sequence:__entity__ upstream of it .
Here we present evidence for yet another B:__entity__ cell:__entity__ specific:__entity__ octamer:__entity__ binding:__entity__ protein:__entity__ of 75 kd ( OTF-2B:__entity__ ) .
From several findings , including the absence of OTF-2B:__entity__ ( but not OTF-2A:__entity__ ) from a lymphocyte line that can not respond to the IgH:__entity__ enhancer:__entity__ , we propose a role of the novel:__entity__ octamer:__entity__ factor:__entity__ in the long range activation by the IgH:__entity__ enhancer:__entity__ .
We have used the proteolytic clipping bandshift assay ( PCBA ) technique to distinguish the three different forms found in B cells .
This analysis indicates that the 75 kd-species OTF-2B:__entity__ is closely related to the 60:__entity__ kd:__entity__ species:__entity__ OTF-2A:__entity__ .
Inhibition of interleukin:__entity__ 2:__entity__ -induced proliferation of cloned murine T cells by glucocorticoids .
Possible involvement of an inhibitory:__entity__ protein:__entity__ .
The ability of glucocorticoids to inhibit interleukin:__entity__ 2:__entity__ ( IL:__entity__ 2:__entity__ ) -induced T cell proliferation in two cytotoxic T cell ( CTL ) clones has been studied .
A complete inhibition of DNA synthesis by dexamethasone ( Dx ) could be observed when IL 2-depleted cultures of CTL were either incubated for 6 h with the hormone:__entity__ prior to the addition of IL:__entity__ 2:__entity__ or treated simultaneously with Dx and a low concentration of IL:__entity__ 2:__entity__ .
No significant reduction in the number and affinity of IL:__entity__ 2:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ was seen after 6 h incubation with Dx .
The order of potency observed with the different steroids indicated that this inhibitory effect was mediated through binding to a specific glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ .
The action of these hormones:__entity__ possibly involves the synthesis of an inhibitory:__entity__ protein:__entity__ ( s ) , since the presence of cycloheximide during the incubation with Dx prevented the inhibition of DNA synthesis .
Furthermore , supernatant from Dx-treated CTL contained a nondialyzable factor which inhibited DNA synthesis and cell growth of CTL clones induced by IL:__entity__ 2:__entity__ .
Blocking of IL:__entity__ 2:__entity__ synthesis and IL:__entity__ 2:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ formation have been proposed as one of the major mechanisms of glucocorticoid-induced immunosuppression .
Our results indicate that these hormones:__entity__ may also affect T cell proliferation by inhibiting IL:__entity__ 2:__entity__ activity .
Identification and purification of a human:__entity__ immunoglobulin-enhancer-binding:__entity__ protein:__entity__ ( NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ ) that activates transcription from a human:__entity__ immunodeficiency:__entity__ virus:__entity__ type:__entity__ 1:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ in vitro .
The enhancer-binding:__entity__ factor:__entity__ NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ , which is found only in cells that transcribe immunoglobulin:__entity__ light:__entity__ chain:__entity__ genes:__entity__ , has been purified from nuclear extracts of Namalwa cells ( human Burkitt lymphoma cells ) by sequence-specific DNA affinity chromatography .
The purified NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ has been identified as a 51-kDa:__entity__ polypeptide:__entity__ by UV-crosslinking analysis .
`` Footprint '' and methylation-interference analyses have shown that purified NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ has a binding activity specific for the kappa:__entity__ light:__entity__ chain:__entity__ enhancer:__entity__ sequence:__entity__ .
The purified factor activated in vitro transcription of the human:__entity__ immunodeficiency:__entity__ virus:__entity__ type:__entity__ I:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ by binding to an upstream:__entity__ NF-kappa:__entity__ B-binding:__entity__ site:__entity__
Lymphocyte glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ binding in depression : normal values following recovery .
The number of glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ sites in lymphocytes and plasma cortisol concentrations were measured in 20 patients who had recovered from major depressive disorder and 20 healthy control subjects .
The number of glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ sites in lymphocytes from the recovered depressed group was not significantly different from that of the control group .
Although the mean plasma cortisol concentration in recovered depressives was higher than in control subjects , the difference only just reached significance .
This study shows that the reduction in glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ numbers which occurs during acute depressive illness does not persist on recovery and is , therefore , state-dependent .
Identification and purification of a human:__entity__ lymphoid-specific:__entity__ octamer-binding:__entity__ protein:__entity__ ( OTF-2:__entity__ ) that activates transcription of an immunoglobulin:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ in vitro .
The octamer sequence 5'-ATGCAAAT , in either orientation , serves as an upstream:__entity__ element:__entity__ in a variety of promoters:__entity__ and also occurs as a modular:__entity__ enhancer:__entity__ element:__entity__ .
It is of particular interest in immunoglobulin:__entity__ genes:__entity__ since it is found in the upstream:__entity__ regions:__entity__ of all heavy:__entity__ and:__entity__ light:__entity__ chain:__entity__ promoters:__entity__ and in the heavy:__entity__ chain:__entity__ enhancer:__entity__ , both of which are known to be necessary for cell-specific expression .
We report here the chromatographic separation of ubiquitous:__entity__ and:__entity__ B:__entity__ cell-specific:__entity__ octamer-binding:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ .
The B:__entity__ cell:__entity__ factor:__entity__ was purified to homogeneity using affinity chromatography and consists of three peptides of 62 , 61 , and 58.5 +/- 1.5 kd .
Each of the polypeptides was renatured after SDS-PAGE and shown to bind to the octamer sequence .
The specific DNA binding activity of the pure B:__entity__ cell-specific:__entity__ factor:__entity__ was indistinguishable from that of the affinity-purified:__entity__ ubiquitous:__entity__ factor:__entity__ .
This B:__entity__ cell-specific:__entity__ octamer-binding:__entity__ factor:__entity__ , in pure form , activated transcription from a kappa:__entity__ light:__entity__ chain:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ in vitro , thus demonstrating that it is indeed a B:__entity__ cell-specific:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ for this gene .
In addition to the ubiquitous:__entity__ and:__entity__ B:__entity__ cell-specific:__entity__ octamer-binding:__entity__ factors:__entity__ , we identified several additional proteins , one of which is B cell -specific , that interact with the kappa:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ .
Decreased deoxyribonucleic acid binding of glucocorticoid-receptor:__entity__ complex:__entity__ in cultured skin fibroblasts from a patient with the glucocorticoid resistance syndrome .
A patient with the syndrome of glucocorticoid resistance was studied .
A 27-yr-old woman initially was diagnosed as having Cushing 's disease , based on the findings of high plasma ACTH and serum cortisol levels , increased urinary cortisol secretion , resistance to adrenal suppression with dexamethasone , and bilateral adrenal hyperplasia by computed tomography and scintigraphy of the adrenal glands .
However , she had no signs or symptoms of Cushing 's syndrome .
During a 5-yr follow-up , no clinical abnormalities developed , although hypercortisolism persisted .
End-organ resistance to cortisol was suspected .
To explain the end-organ resistance to cortisol , the glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ ( GR:__entity__ ) in peripheral mononuclear leukocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts from a forearm skin biopsy were characterized and compared with the results of similar studies in normal subjects .
The patient 's GR:__entity__ in whole cell assays had an increased dissociation constant ( Kd ) .
In the cytosol of cultured skin fibroblasts from the patient , there was also decreased binding capacity .
The thermal stability and the sedimentation coefficient in a sucrose density gradient of the receptors in the cytosol of cultured skin fibroblasts from the patient and normal subjects were similar .
GR complex activation , analyzed by DEAE-cellulose chromatography , was decreased in the patient .
DNA:__entity__ binding of the GR:__entity__ complex:__entity__ after temperature-induced activation was lower in the patient than in normal subjects .
Nuclear translocation of GR:__entity__ complexes:__entity__ from the patient was also slightly decreased .
These results suggest that the patient 's glucocorticoid resistance was due to a decrease in the affinity of the receptor for glucocorticoids and a decrease in the binding of the GR:__entity__ complex:__entity__ to DNA:__entity__ .
Granulocyte-macrophage:__entity__ colony-stimulating:__entity__ factor:__entity__ .
Sensitive and receptor-mediated regulation by 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes .
We show that 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1 , 25 [ OH ] 2D3 ) , the most hormonally active metabolite of vitamin D3 , modulates sensitively and specifically both the protein and messenger:__entity__ RNA:__entity__ accumulation of the multilineage:__entity__ growth:__entity__ factor:__entity__ granulocyte-macrophage:__entity__ colony-stimulating:__entity__ factor:__entity__ ( GM-CSF:__entity__ ) .
The regulation of GM-CSF:__entity__ expression is seen in both normal human mitogen-activated T lymphocytes and T lymphocytes from a line ( S-LB1 ) transformed with human T cell lymphotropic virus 1 ( HTLV-1 ) .
In contrast , cells from a HTLV-1 transformed T lymphocyte line ( Ab-VDR ) established from a patient with vitamin D-resistant rickets type II with undetectable 1:__entity__ ,:__entity__ 25:__entity__ (:__entity__ OH:__entity__ ):__entity__ 2D3:__entity__ cellular:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ are resistant to the action of 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 .
Inhibition of GM-CSF:__entity__ expression by 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 can occur independently of interleukin:__entity__ 2:__entity__ regulation and is probably mediated through cellular:__entity__ 1:__entity__ ,:__entity__ 25:__entity__ (:__entity__ OH:__entity__ ):__entity__ 2D3:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ .
We conclude that 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 may be important in the physiology of hematopoiesis .
Altered interaction between triiodothyronine and its nuclear:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ in absence of cortisol : a proposed mechanism for increased thyrotropin secretion in corticosteroid deficiency states .
Thyroid hormones occasionally appear less effective when administered alone to patients with panhypopituitarism , and manifestations suggestive of hypothyroidism have been reported in patients suffering from untreated Addison 's disease .
In the latter condition , thyrotropin secretion is increased : this occurs already after as little as 2 days of temporary withdrawal of therapy with substitution doses of corticosteroids while circulating levels of thyroid hormones remain within normal limits .
Therefore , a possible role of cortisol in interaction between triiodothyronine and its nuclear:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ was examined at the level of circulating lymphocytes obtained from patients with primary or secondary adrenocortical failure .
The affinity of these receptors was found to be decreased , by more than 50 % on average , in the absence of cortisol treatments .
This change was promptly corrected upon resumption of therapy .
The number of binding sites was not significantly modified .
The influence of cortisol on thyroid:__entity__ hormone:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ discussed here might account for the clinical observations mentioned above .
Inhibition by cortisol of human natural killer ( NK ) cell activity .
The effects of cortisol on the natural killer ( NK ) activity of human peripheral blood mononuclear ( PBM ) cells were studied in vitro using a direct 4-h 51Cr-release assay and K 562 cell line as a target .
Preincubation for 20 h of PBM cells drawn from healthy donors with 1 X 10 ( -8 ) to 1 X 10 ( -5 ) M cortisol resulted in a significant decrease of NK cell activity .
The magnitude of the suppression was directly related to the steroid concentration and inversely related to the number of effector cells .
Cortisol was able to minimize the enhancement of NK cytotoxicity obtainable in the presence of immune interferon ( IFN-gamma ) .
A significantly higher suppression was achieved after sequential exposure of PBM cells to cortisol and equimolar levels of prostaglandin E2 ( PgE2 ) .
The concomitant incubation with theophylline and isobutyl-methylxanthine failed to enhance the cortisol-induced suppression , whereas PgE2-dependent inhibition significantly increased after exposure of PBM cells to methyl-xanthines .
The inhibitory effect of cortisol was partially or totally prevented by the concomitant incubation with equimolar amounts of 11-deoxycortisol and RU 486 but not of progesterone .
Treatment of NK effectors with a monoclonal:__entity__ anti-human:__entity__ corticosteroid-binding:__entity__ globulin:__entity__ (:__entity__ CBG:__entity__ ):__entity__ antibody:__entity__ produced an enhancement of the spontaneous NK activity and a partial suppression of cortisol-mediated effects .
Our results suggest that endogenous glucocorticoids play a role in the regulation of NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity .
Since the effect of cortisol was additive to that of PgE2 and was not changed by phosphodiesterase:__entity__ inhibitors , it is conceivable that the hormone acts at a level different from the adenylate:__entity__ cyclase:__entity__ - phosphodiesterase:__entity__ system .
Data obtained with the use of antiglucocorticoids and the anti-CBG:__entity__ antibody:__entity__ are compatible with a role both of high-affinity glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ and of CBG:__entity__ in mediating cortisol action on the human NK cell activity .
Interaction of cell-type-specific:__entity__ nuclear:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ with immunoglobulin:__entity__ VH:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ region:__entity__ sequences:__entity__ .
All human:__entity__ and:__entity__ murine:__entity__ immunoglobulin:__entity__ heavy:__entity__ chain:__entity__ variable:__entity__ region:__entity__ (:__entity__ VH:__entity__ ):__entity__ genes:__entity__ contain the sequence ATGCAAAT approximately 70 nucleotides 5 ' from the site of transcription initiation .
This octanucleotide , in reverse orientation , is also found in all light:__entity__ chain:__entity__ variable:__entity__ region:__entity__ (:__entity__ VL:__entity__ ):__entity__ genes:__entity__ , and in the immunoglobulin:__entity__ heavy:__entity__ chain:__entity__ transcriptional:__entity__ enhancer:__entity__ .
Transfection studies have established that this octamer is involved in the lymphoid-specific transcription of immunoglobulin:__entity__ genes:__entity__ .
Octamer-containing:__entity__ fragments:__entity__ have been reported to bind a factor present in nuclear extracts of human cell lines ; however , identical binding activity was detected in both B lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells .
Here we establish that nuclear extracts from distinct cell types differ in their ability to interact with octamer-containing:__entity__ fragments:__entity__ .
We have also detected a DNA-protein interaction that may be involved in the cell-type specificity of immunoglobulin:__entity__ expression , and we have determined that a sequence upstream of the octamer participates in an interaction with a nuclear:__entity__ protein:__entity__ ( s ) .
Preferential transcription of HTLV-I:__entity__ LTR:__entity__ in cell-free extracts of human T cells producing HTLV-I:__entity__ viral:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ .
The promoters:__entity__ of the adenovirus:__entity__ 2:__entity__ major:__entity__ late:__entity__ gene:__entity__ , the mouse:__entity__ beta-globin:__entity__ gene:__entity__ , the mouse:__entity__ immunoglobulin:__entity__ VH:__entity__ gene:__entity__ and the LTR:__entity__ of the human T-lymphotropic retrovirus type I were tested for their transcription activities in cell-free extracts of four cell lines ; HeLa , CESS ( Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human B cell line ) , MT-1 ( HTLV-I-infected human T cell line without viral protein synthesis ) , and MT-2 ( HTLV-I-infected human T cell line producing viral:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ ) .
LTR:__entity__ was preferentially transcribed in the extracts of MT-2 although the other three genes were transcribed with relatively constant efficiencies in different extracts .
The results agree well with the previous in vivo studies on the promoter activity of HTLV-I:__entity__ LTR:__entity__ .
Mixing of HeLa and MT-2 extracts revealed the presence of a LTR-specific stimulating activity in MT-2 extracts .
A nuclear:__entity__ factor:__entity__ that binds to a conserved sequence motif in transcriptional:__entity__ control:__entity__ elements:__entity__ of immunoglobulin:__entity__ genes:__entity__ .
Trans-acting:__entity__ factors:__entity__ that mediate B-cell specific transcription of immunoglobulin:__entity__ genes:__entity__ have been postulated based on an analysis of the expression of exogenously introduced immunoglobulin:__entity__ gene:__entity__ recombinants:__entity__ in lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells .
Two B-cell-specific , cis-acting:__entity__ transcriptional:__entity__ regulatory:__entity__ elements:__entity__ have been identified .
One element is located in the intron between the variable ( V ) and constant ( C ) regions of both heavy:__entity__ and:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ light-chain:__entity__ genes:__entity__ and acts as a transcriptional enhancer .
The second element:__entity__ is found upstream of both heavy:__entity__ and:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ light-chain:__entity__ gene:__entity__ promoters:__entity__ .
This element directs lymphoid-specific transcription even in the presence of viral:__entity__ enhancers:__entity__ .
We have sought nuclear factors that might bind specifically to these two regulatory:__entity__ elements:__entity__ by application of a modified gel electrophoresis DNA binding assay .
We report here the identification of a human:__entity__ B-cell:__entity__ nuclear:__entity__ factor:__entity__ ( IgNF-A:__entity__ ) that binds to DNA:__entity__ sequences:__entity__ in the upstream:__entity__ regions:__entity__ of both the mouse:__entity__ heavy:__entity__ and:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ light-chain:__entity__ gene:__entity__ promoters:__entity__ and also to the mouse:__entity__ heavy-chain:__entity__ gene:__entity__ enhancer:__entity__ .
This sequence-specific binding is probably mediated by a highly conserved sequence motif , ATTTGCAT , present in all three transcriptional:__entity__ elements:__entity__ .
Interestingly , a factor showing similar binding specificity to IgNF-A:__entity__ is also present in human HeLa cells .
The new world primates as animal models of glucocorticoid resistance .
Many New World primate species have greatly increased plasma cortisol concentrations , decreased plasma cortisol binding globulin capacity and affinity , marked resistance of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to suppression by dexamethasone , and no biological evidence of glucocorticoid excess .
These primates also have high levels of circulating progesterone , estrogen , mineralocorticoid , androgen and vitamin D .
The glucocorticoid target tissues that have been examined ( circulating mononuclear lymphocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts ) have normal concentrations of glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ with decreased affinity for dexamethasone .
Transformation of B-lymphocytes with the Epstein-Barr virus leads to glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ induction that is less than that observed with cells from Old World primates .
The receptor in these cells has a low affinity for dexamethasone .
The low affinity leads to an increased loss of specific bound ligand during thermal activation .
Meroreceptor generation is normal .
The molecular weight of the receptor , determined by SDS-PAGE , is similar to that of Old World primates ( approximately 92 , 000 ) and the activation pattern per se , examined in vitro by heating cytosol and performing phosphocellulose chromatography , appears similar to that of human controls .
The ratios of nuclear to cytosolic:__entity__ hormone-receptor-complexes:__entity__ and of cytosolic activated to unactivated:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ complexes:__entity__ in intact cells are similar to Old World primates .
Results from mixing studies do not support the hypothesis that a binding inhibitor ( s ) or a deficient cytosolic positive modifier ( s ) of binding underlies the findings in these primates .
The New World primates , unlike men with the syndrome of primary cortisol resistance , have compensated for their condition with intra-adrenal and mineralocorticoid receptor adaptations .
Thus , unlike Old World primates , cortisol in New World primates has only weak sodium-retaining potency because the aldosterone:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ has a low affinity for cortisol .
The common element that would explain the apparent resistance to six steroid hormones in New World primates
Acetylation and modulation of erythroid:__entity__ Kruppel-like:__entity__ factor:__entity__ ( EKLF:__entity__ ) activity by interaction with histone:__entity__ acetyltransferases:__entity__ .
Erythroid:__entity__ Kruppel-like:__entity__ factor:__entity__ ( EKLF:__entity__ ) is a red:__entity__ cell-specific:__entity__ transcriptional:__entity__ activator:__entity__ that is crucial for consolidating the switch to high levels of adult beta-globin expression during erythroid ontogeny .
EKLF:__entity__ is required for integrity of the chromatin structure at the beta-like:__entity__ globin:__entity__ locus:__entity__ , and it interacts with a positive-acting:__entity__ factor:__entity__ in vivo .
We find that EKLF:__entity__ is an acetylated:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ , and that it interacts in vivo with CBP:__entity__ , p300:__entity__ , and P/CAF:__entity__ .
However , its interactions with these histone:__entity__ acetyltransferases:__entity__ are not equivalent , as CBP:__entity__ and p300:__entity__ , but not P/CAF:__entity__ , utilize EKLF:__entity__ as a substrate for in vitro acetylation within its trans-activation region .
The functional effects of these interactions are that CBP:__entity__ and p300:__entity__ , but not P/CAF:__entity__ , enhance EKLF:__entity__ 's transcriptional activation of the beta-globin:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ in erythroid cells .
These results establish EKLF:__entity__ as a tissue-specific:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ that undergoes post-translational acetylation and suggest a mechanism by which EKLF:__entity__ is able to alter chromatin structure and induce beta-globin expression within the beta-like:__entity__ globin:__entity__ cluster:__entity__ .
Recognition of herpes:__entity__ simplex:__entity__ virus:__entity__ type:__entity__ 2:__entity__ tegument:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ by CD4 T cells infiltrating human genital herpes lesions .
The local cellular immune response to herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) is important in the control of recurrent HSV infection .
The antiviral functions of infiltrating CD4-bearing T cells may include cytotoxicity , inhibition of viral growth , lymphokine secretion , and support of humoral and CD8 responses .
The antigens recognized by many HSV-specific CD4 T cells localizing to genital HSV-2 lesions are unknown .
T cells recognizing antigens encoded within map units 0.67 to 0.73 of HSV:__entity__ DNA:__entity__ are frequently recovered from herpetic lesions .
Expression cloning with this region of DNA now shows that tegument:__entity__ protein:__entity__ VP22:__entity__ and the viral:__entity__ dUTPase:__entity__ , encoded by genes:__entity__ UL49:__entity__ and:__entity__ UL50:__entity__ , respectively , are T-cell:__entity__ antigens:__entity__ .
Separate epitopes:__entity__ in VP22:__entity__ were defined for T-cell clones from each of three patients .
Reactivity with the tegument:__entity__ protein:__entity__ encoded by UL21:__entity__ was identified for an additional patient .
Three new epitopes were identified in VP16:__entity__ , a tegument:__entity__ protein:__entity__ associated with VP22:__entity__ .
Some tegument-specific CD4 T-cell clones exhibited cytotoxic activity against HSV-infected cells .
These results suggest that herpes:__entity__ simplex:__entity__ tegument:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ are processed for antigen presentation in vivo and are possible candidate compounds for herpes simplex vaccines .
Fibrinogen:__entity__ activates NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ in mononuclear phagocytes .
Adhesion to extracellular matrices is known to modulate leukocyte activation , although the mechanisms are not fully understood .
Mononuclear phagocytes are exposed to fibrinous provisional matrix throughout migration into inflammatory foci , so this study was undertaken to determine whether fibrinogen triggers activation of NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ .
U937 cells differentiated with PMA in nonadherent culture were shown to express two fibrinogen-binding:__entity__ integrins:__entity__ , predominately CD11b/CD18:__entity__ , and to a lesser extent , CD11c/CD18:__entity__ .
Cells stimulated with fibrinogen:__entity__ ( 10-100 microg/ml ) /Mn2+ ( 50 microM ) for 2 h were examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ activation , minimal in unstimulated cells , was substantially up-regulated by fibrinogen:__entity__ .
Fibrinogen:__entity__ also caused activation of AP-1:__entity__ , but not SP1:__entity__ or cAMP:__entity__ response:__entity__ element-binding:__entity__ protein:__entity__ (:__entity__ CREB:__entity__ ):__entity__ factors:__entity__ .
Blocking mAbs:__entity__ against CD18:__entity__ and CD11b:__entity__ abrogated fibrinogen:__entity__ -induced NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ activation .
To determine the effects on transcriptional regulation , U937 cells were transfected with a plasmid containing the HIV-1:__entity__ enhancer:__entity__ ( bearing two NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ sites:__entity__ ) coupled to a chloramphenicol:__entity__ acetyltransferase:__entity__ (:__entity__ CAT:__entity__ ):__entity__ reporter:__entity__ .
Cells were subsequently stimulated with 1 ) PMA for 24 h , inducing CAT activity by 2.6-fold , 2 ) fibrinogen:__entity__ /Mn2+ for 2 h , inducing CAT activity by 3.2-fold , or 3 ) costimulation with fibrinogen:__entity__ and PMA , inducing 5.7-fold the CAT activity induced by PMA alone .
We conclude that contact with fibrinogen-derived:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ may contribute to mononuclear phagocyte activation by signaling through CD11b/CD18:__entity__ , resulting in selective activation of transcriptional:__entity__ regulatory:__entity__ factors:__entity__ , including NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ .
Peripheral blood T cells and monocytes and B cell lines derived from patients with lupus express estrogen receptor transcripts similar to those of normal cells .
OBJECTIVE : To identify and characterize estrogen:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ (:__entity__ ER:__entity__ ):__entity__ transcripts:__entity__ expressed in immune cells of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) and healthy donors .
METHODS : Peripheral blood monocytes and T cells were prepared from patients with SLE ( n = 6 ) and healthy donors ( n = 8 ) .
T cells were separated into CD4 and CD8 .
Some monocytes and T cells were stimulated with estradiol , PMA , and ionomycin .
Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cell lines ( n = 7 ) and B cell hybridomas ( n = 2 ) established from patients with SLE and a healthy individual were used as a B cell source .
These cells were examined for ER:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ by reverse transcription nested polymerase chain reaction .
Amplified cDNA:__entity__ were sequenced by standard methods .
RESULTS : In all cells tested , ER:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ was expressed without prior in vitro stimulation .
Partial sequences from exons:__entity__ 1-8:__entity__ were nearly identical to the published sequence of the human:__entity__ ER:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ .
There were no notable differences in the ER:__entity__ transcripts:__entity__ between patients and healthy controls .
Variant receptor transcripts lacking exon:__entity__ 5:__entity__ or exon:__entity__ 7:__entity__ , which encodes the hormone:__entity__ binding:__entity__ domain:__entity__ , were identified in the majority of the cells .
Precise deletion of the exons suggests that they are alternatively spliced transcripts .
Whether the detected transcripts are translated into functional:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ remains to be determined .
In vitro stimulation did not affect ER:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ expression .
The presence of variants did not correlate with disease activity or medication .
CONCLUSION : Monocytes , T cells , and B cells in patients express transcripts of the normal wild:__entity__ type:__entity__ ER:__entity__ and the hormone:__entity__ binding:__entity__ domain:__entity__ variants:__entity__ in vivo .
DNA damaging agents induce expression of Fas:__entity__ ligand:__entity__ and subsequent apoptosis in T lymphocytes via the activation of NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ and AP-1:__entity__ .
Apoptosis induced by DNA damage and other stresses can proceed via expression of Fas:__entity__ ligand:__entity__ ( FasL:__entity__ ) and ligation of its receptor , Fas ( CD95 ) .
We report that activation of the two transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ and:__entity__ AP-1:__entity__ is crucially involved in FasL:__entity__ expression induced by etoposide , teniposide , and UV irradiation .
A nondegradable:__entity__ mutant:__entity__ of I:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ blocked both FasL:__entity__ expression and apoptosis induced by DNA damage but not Fas ligation .
These stimuli also induced the stress-activated kinase pathway ( SAPK/JNK ) , which was required for the maximal induction of apoptosis .
A 1.2 kb FasL:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ responded to DNA damage , as well as coexpression with p65:__entity__ Rel:__entity__ or Fos/Jun:__entity__ .
Mutations in the relevant NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ and:__entity__ AP-1:__entity__ binding:__entity__ sites:__entity__ eliminated these responses .
Thus , activation of NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ and AP-1:__entity__ contributes to stress-induced apoptosis via the expression of FasL:__entity__ .
A small , nonpeptidyl mimic of granulocyte-colony-stimulating:__entity__ factor:__entity__ [ see commetns ]
A nonpeptidyl small molecule SB 247464 , capable of activating granulocyte-colony-stimulating:__entity__ factor:__entity__ ( G-CSF:__entity__ ) signal transduction pathways , was identified in a high-throughput assay in cultured cells .
Like G-CSF:__entity__ , SB 247464 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple:__entity__ signaling:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ and stimulated primary murine bone marrow cells to form granulocytic colonies in vitro .
It also elevated peripheral blood neutrophil counts in mice .
The extracellular domain of the murine:__entity__ G-CSF:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ was required for the activity of SB 247464 , suggesting that the compound acts by oligomerizing:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ chains:__entity__ .
The results indicate that a small molecule can activate a receptor that normally binds a relatively large protein ligand .
Minimal residual disease in acute myelogenous leukemia with PML/RAR:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ or AML1/ETO:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ and phenotypic analysis of possible T and natural killer cells in bone marrow .
Here we studied minimal residual disease ( MRD ) of patients with acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) who have PML/RAR:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ or AML1/ETO:__entity__ as well as the phenotypic analysis of lymphocyte subsets involved in antitumor immunity .
Eight patients in long-term ( LT ; 3 to 15 years ) and 15 patients in short-term ( ST ; up to 3 years ) remission were studied .
Using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT ) assay , the limit of detection was 10 ( -5 ) to 10 ( -6 ) for PML/RAR:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ transcript:__entity__ and 10 ( -4 ) to 10 ( -5 ) for the AML1/ETO:__entity__ transcript:__entity__ .
Simultaneously , T lymphocyte subsets and NK cells from the peripheral blood ( PB ) and bone marrow ( BM ) were investigated by flow cytometric analysis .
Four of the eight patients in LT and 7 of the 15 patients in ST remission were MRD-positive .
Although all MRD-positive patients in LT remission are still until now event-free , 3 of the 7 MRD-positive ( MRD+ ) patients in ST remission soon relapsed .
The total populations of CD4:__entity__ + , CD8:__entity__ + and CD56:__entity__ + [ possible T-cell and natural killer ( T/NK ) populations ] in the BM of ST patients and MRD+/LT patients were significantly ( p < .01 ) low .
The CD8+ CD28+ population showed the same tendency ( p < .01-.02 ) .
The T/NK subsets in the BM of MRD-negative ( MRD- ) LT ( MRD-/LT ) patients showed similar numbers of cells as normal volunteers .
Basically , the total percentage of the CD4+ , CD8+ and CD56+ cell populations in the BM was increased and in the following order : MRD-/LT patients , normal volunteers , MRD+/LT patients and MRD+ or -/ST patients .
The percentages of the T/NK-cell subsets in the PB were not significantly different among these groups .
Thus , the difference of the possible T/NK-cell phenotype in the BM may strongly influence clinical and molecular remission .
These results still remain to be confirmed by further studies of the functional anti-tumor immunity of T/NK cells of AML in remission .
Mycobacterium tuberculosis mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan can induce NF-kappaB:__entity__ -dependent activation of human:__entity__ immunodeficiency:__entity__ virus:__entity__ type:__entity__ 1:__entity__ long:__entity__ terminal:__entity__ repeat:__entity__ in T cells .
Tuberculosis has emerged as an epidemic , extended by the large number of individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) .
The major goal of this study was to determine whether the mycobacterial cell wall component mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan ( ManLAM ) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( M. tuberculosis ) could activate transcription of HIV-1 in T cells with the use of an in vitro cell culture system .
These experiments are of prime importance considering that CD4:__entity__ -expressing T lymphocytes represent the major virus reservoir in the peripheral blood of infected individuals .
Using the 1G5 cell line harbouring the luciferase reporter gene under the control of the HIV-1:__entity__ LTR:__entity__ , it was first found that culture protein filtrates ( CFP ) from M. tuberculosis or purified ManLAM could activate HIV-1:__entity__ LTR-dependent:__entity__ gene:__entity__ expression unlike similarly prepared CFP extracts devoid of ManLAM .
The implication of protein:__entity__ tyrosine:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ (:__entity__ s:__entity__ ):__entity__ , protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ A:__entity__ and/or protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ C:__entity__ was highlighted by the abrogation of the ManLAM-mediated activation of HIV-1 LTR-driven gene expression using herbimycin A and H7 .
It was also determined , using electrophoresis mobility shift assays , that M. tuberculosis ManLAM led to the nuclear translocation of the transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ NF-kappaB:__entity__ .
M. tuberculosis ManLAM resulted in clear induction of the luciferase:__entity__ gene:__entity__ placed under the control of the wild-type:__entity__ ,:__entity__ but:__entity__ not:__entity__ the:__entity__ kappaB-mutated:__entity__ ,:__entity__ HIV-1:__entity__ LTR:__entity__ region:__entity__ .
Finally , the ManLAM-mediated activation of HIV-1 LTR transcription was found to be independent of the autocrine or paracrine action of endogenous:__entity__ TNF-alpha:__entity__ .
The results suggest that M. tuberculosis can upregulate HIV-1 expression in T cells and could thus have the potential to influence the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection .
Human:__entity__ immunodeficiency:__entity__ virus:__entity__ type:__entity__ 1:__entity__ long:__entity__ terminal:__entity__ repeat:__entity__ quasispecies differ in basal transcription and nuclear factor recruitment in human glial cells and lymphocytes .
The generation of genomic diversity during the course of infection has the potential to affect all aspects of HIV-1 replication , including expression of the proviral genome .
To gain a better understanding of the impact of long:__entity__ terminal:__entity__ repeat:__entity__ ( LTR:__entity__ ) sequence diversity on LTR-directed:__entity__ gene:__entity__ expression in cells of the central nervous system ( CNS ) and immune system , we amplified and cloned LTRs:__entity__ from proviral DNA in HIV-1-infected peripheral blood .
Sequence analysis of nineteen LTRs:__entity__ cloned from 2 adult and 3 pediatric patients revealed an average of 33 nucleotide changes ( with respect to the sequence of the LAI:__entity__ LTR:__entity__ ) within the 455-bp:__entity__ U3:__entity__ region:__entity__ .
Transient expression analyses in cells of neuroglial and lymphocytic origin demonstrated that some of these LTRs:__entity__ had activities which varied significantly from the LAI:__entity__ LTR:__entity__ in U-373 MG cells ( an astrocytoma cell line ) as well as in Jurkat cells ( a CD4-positive lymphocyte cell line ) .
While LTRs:__entity__ which demonstrated the highest activities in U-373 MG cells also yielded high activities in Jurkat cells , the LTRs:__entity__ were generally more active in Jurkat cells when compared to the LAI:__entity__ LTR:__entity__ .
Differences in LTR:__entity__ sequence:__entity__ also resulted in differences in transcription factor recruitment to cis-acting:__entity__ sites:__entity__ within the U3:__entity__ region:__entity__ of the LTR:__entity__ , as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays .
In particular , naturally occurring sequence variation impacted transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ binding to an activating:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ / cAMP:__entity__ response:__entity__ element:__entity__ binding:__entity__ ( ATF:__entity__ / CREB:__entity__ ) binding site ( located between the LEF-1:__entity__ and:__entity__ distal:__entity__ NF-kappaB:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ binding:__entity__ sites:__entity__ ) that we identified in previous studies of the HIV-1:__entity__ LTR:__entity__ .
These findings suggest that LTR:__entity__ sequence:__entity__ changes can significantly affect basal LTR function and transcription factor recruitment , which may , in turn , alter the course of viral replication in cells of CNS and immune system origin .
HMG:__entity__ box:__entity__ containing:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ in lymphocyte differentiation .
The identification of the mammalian:__entity__ sex-determining:__entity__ gene:__entity__ Sry:__entity__ has led to the discovery of a large family of related ( ' HMG:__entity__ box:__entity__ ' ) transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ that control developmental events in yeast , C. elegans , Drosophila and vertebrates .
In lymphocyte differentiation , several HMG:__entity__ box:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ play a decisive role .
Sox-4:__entity__ is important for very early B-cell differentiation , while TCF-1:__entity__ / LEF-1:__entity__ play a crucial role in early thymocyte development .
TCF/LEF:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ have recently been found to constitute a downstream component of the Wingless/Wnt signal transduction pathway .
In flies , this pathway controls segment polarity ; in Xenopus it controls the definition of the body axis .
Deregulation of the pathway occurs in several human tumors .
These insights in the molecular events that are involved in TCF/LEF:__entity__ function in these organisms may eventually lead to the understanding of the function of these HMG:__entity__ box:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ in lymphoid development
Transcriptional regulation by C/EBP:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ and:__entity__ -beta:__entity__ in the expression of the gene for the MRP14:__entity__ myeloid:__entity__ calcium:__entity__ binding:__entity__ protein:__entity__ .
Transcriptional regulation of the gene for the myeloid:__entity__ calcium:__entity__ binding:__entity__ protein:__entity__ , MRP14:__entity__ , was investigated in human monocytic leukemia cell lines .
The MRP14:__entity__ gene:__entity__ was not expressed in monoblastic ML-1 cells , promonocytic U-937 cells , or promyelocytic HL-60 cells .
On the other hand , the gene was expressed in monocytic THP-1 cells and in the HL-60 cells treated with 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( VD3 ) .
The level of MRP14:__entity__ in VD3-treated HL-60 cells was two-fold higher than that in THP-1 cells .
Among several known transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ binding:__entity__ motifs:__entity__ , nuclear:__entity__ protein:__entity__ (:__entity__ s:__entity__ ):__entity__ of VD3-treated HL-60 cells and THP-1 cells bound to the CCAAT/enhancer:__entity__ binding:__entity__ protein:__entity__ (:__entity__ C/EBP:__entity__ ):__entity__ -binding:__entity__ motif:__entity__ that was located in the upstream:__entity__ region:__entity__ of the MRP14:__entity__ gene:__entity__ ( -81 ) , as evidenced by the competitive gel mobility-shift assay .
An antibody for C/EBP:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ super-shifted the nucleoprotein:__entity__ complex:__entity__ in THP-1 cells but not in the VD3-treated HL-60 cells , whereas an antibody for C/EBP:__entity__ beta:__entity__ blocked the formation of the complex with the nuclear:__entity__ factor:__entity__ of the HL-60 cells but not with that of THP-1 cells .
An anti-C/EBP:__entity__ delta:__entity__ antibody:__entity__ had no effect on the complex in either cell .
Thus , it was concluded that C/EBP:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ and:__entity__ -beta:__entity__ were able to bind to the C/EBP:__entity__ motif:__entity__ , and that C/EBP:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ bound to the motif in THP-1 cells and C/EBP:__entity__ beta:__entity__ bound to that in the VD3-treated HL-60 cells .
Furthermore , to examine the transcriptional activity of the C/EBP:__entity__ motif:__entity__ , we transfected several constructed luciferase:__entity__ reporter:__entity__ DNAs:__entity__ into HL-60 cells and THP-1 cells .
The luciferase activity of the C/EBP:__entity__ motif:__entity__ in HL-60 cells was increased by VD3 treatment .
The C/EBP:__entity__ motif:__entity__ in the MRP14:__entity__ gene:__entity__ was confirmed to function as a regulatory region in VD3-treated HL-60 cells and THP-1 cells by the assay .
Since C/EBP:__entity__ beta:__entity__ was also detected in VD3-untreated HL-60 cells by immunoblotting , VD3 activated C/EBP:__entity__ beta:__entity__ to bind to the motif , probably through post-translational modification .
Patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome can have polyclonal or clonal haemopoiesis in complete haematological remission .
The clonality of mature peripheral blood-derived myeloid and lymphoid cells and bone marrow haemopoietic progenitors from 18 females with myelodysplasia ( MDS ) ( five refractory anaemia , RA ; one RA with ringed sideroblasts , RARS ; three chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia , CMML ; four RA with excess of blasts , RAEB ; five RAEB in transformation , RAEB-t ) was studied by X-chromosome:__entity__ inactivation analysis .
Using the human androgen-receptor ( HUMARA ) assay , we analysed the clonal patterns of highly purified immature CD34+ 38- and committed CD34+ 38+ marrow-derived progenitors , and CD16+ 14- granulocytes , CD14+ monocytes , CD3+ T and CD19+ B lymphocytes from peripheral blood .
In high-risk patients ( RAEB , RAEB-t ) , clonality analysis was performed before and after intensive remission-induction treatment .
All patients , except one with RA , had predominance of a single clone in their granulocytes and monocytes .
The same clonal pattern was found in CD34+ progenitor cells .
In contrast , CD3+ T lymphocytes were polyclonal or oligoclonal in 14/18 patients .
X-chromosome:__entity__ inactivation patterns of CD19+ B cells were highly concordant with CD3+ T cells except for two patients ( one RA , one CMML ) with monoclonal B and polyclonal T lymphocytes , therefore suggesting a clonal mutation in a progenitor common to the myeloid and B-lymphoid lineages or the coexistence of MDS and a B-cell disorder in these particular patients .
After high-dose non-myeloablative chemotherapy , polyclonal haemopoiesis was reinstalled in the mature myeloid cells and immature and committed marrow progenitors in three of four patients achieving complete haematological remission .
Therefore we conclude that most haematological remissions in MDS are associated with restoration of polyclonal haemopoiesis .
Prominent sex steroid metabolism in human lymphocytes .
Steroid metabolism was investigated in cultured human B-lymphoblastoid cells ( B-LCL ) , and peripheral blood T and B cells .
Gene expression was examined by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction amplification ( RT-PCR ) .
Appropriate sized transcripts:__entity__ were detected in both cultured and fresh peripheral lymphocytes for CYP11A:__entity__ , CYP17:__entity__ , HSD11L:__entity__ ( 11beta-hydroxysteroid:__entity__ dehydrogenase:__entity__ I:__entity__ ) , HSD17B1:__entity__ ( 17beta-hydroxysteroid:__entity__ dehydrogenase:__entity__ type:__entity__ I:__entity__ ) and SRD5A1:__entity__ ( 5alpha-reductase:__entity__ I:__entity__ ) .
B-LCL , but not T and B cells , expressed CYP11B:__entity__ .
There was minimal expression of HSD3B1:__entity__ and HSD3B2:__entity__ ( 3beta-hydroxysteroid:__entity__ dehydrogenase:__entity__ I:__entity__ and:__entity__ II:__entity__ ) in B-LCL and T cells .
Transcripts for CYP19:__entity__ and HSD11K:__entity__ were not detected .
Corresponding enzymatic activity was detectable only for 17-hydroxysteroid:__entity__ dehydrogenase:__entity__ and 5alpha-reductase:__entity__ , respectively producing testosterone and 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone .
Steroid identities were confirmed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry ( GC/MS ) .
One metabolite thought to be deoxycorticosterone was identified by GC/MS as 6alpha-hydroxypregnanolone .
It was concluded that sex hormone metabolism , including androgen synthesis , occurs in lymphocytes , and may modulate immune response .
Human white blood cells and hair follicles are good sources of mRNA:__entity__ for the pterin:__entity__ carbinolamine:__entity__ dehydratase/dimerization:__entity__ cofactor:__entity__ of HNF1:__entity__ for mutation detection .
Pterin:__entity__ carbinolamine:__entity__ dehydratase/dimerization:__entity__ cofactor:__entity__ of HNF1:__entity__ ( PCD/DCoH:__entity__ ) is a protein that has a dual function .
It is a pterin:__entity__ 4alpha-carbinolamine:__entity__ dehydratase:__entity__ that is involved in the regeneration of the cofactor:__entity__ tetrahydrobiopterin:__entity__ during the phenylalanine hydroxylase- catalyzed hydroxylation of phenylalanine .
In addition , it is the dimerization cofactor of HNF1:__entity__ that is able to activate the transcriptional activity of HNF1:__entity__ .
Deficiencies in the gene for this dual:__entity__ functional:__entity__ protein:__entity__ result in hyperphenylalaninemia .
Here we report for the first time that the PCD/DCoH:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ is present in human white blood cells and hair follicles .
Taking advantage of this finding , a sensitive , rapid and convenient method for screening mutations occurring in the coding region of this gene has been described .

Biochemical characterization of the NF-Y:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ complex:__entity__ during B lymphocyte development .
The transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ , NF-Y:__entity__ , plays a critical role in tissue-specific major:__entity__ histocompatibility:__entity__ complex:__entity__ class:__entity__ II:__entity__ gene:__entity__ transcription .
In this report the biochemical properties of the heterotrimeric:__entity__ NF-Y:__entity__ complex:__entity__ have been characterized during stage-specific B-cell development , and in several class II- mutant B-cell lines , which represent distinct bare lymphocyte syndrome class II genetic complementation groups .
The NF-Y:__entity__ complex:__entity__ derived from class II+ mature B-cells bound with high affinity to anion:__entity__ exchangers:__entity__ , and eluted as an intact trimeric:__entity__ complex:__entity__ , whereas , NF-Y:__entity__ derived from class II- plasma B-cells , and from bare lymphocyte syndrome group II cell lines , RJ2.2.5 and RM3 , dissociated into discrete NF-YA:__entity__ and NF-YB:__entity__ ::__entity__ C:__entity__ subunit:__entity__ fractions:__entity__ .
Recombination of the MPC11:__entity__ plasma:__entity__ B-cell:__entity__ derived:__entity__ NF-Y:__entity__ A:__entity__ ::__entity__ B:__entity__ ::__entity__ C:__entity__ complex:__entity__ with the low molecular mass protein fraction , NF-Y-associated:__entity__ factors:__entity__ ( YAFs:__entity__ ) , derived from mature A20 B-cell nuclei , conferred high affinity anion exchange binding to NF-Y:__entity__ as an intact:__entity__ trimeric:__entity__ complex:__entity__ .
Recombination of the native:__entity__ NF-YA:__entity__ ::__entity__ B:__entity__ ::__entity__ C:__entity__ complex:__entity__ with the transcriptional:__entity__ cofactor:__entity__ , PC4:__entity__ , likewise conferred high:__entity__ affinity:__entity__ NF-Y:__entity__ binding to anion:__entity__ exchangers:__entity__ , and stabilized NF-Y:__entity__ interaction with CCAAT-box:__entity__ DNA:__entity__ motifs:__entity__ in vitro .
Interaction between PC4:__entity__ and NF-Y:__entity__ was mapped to the C-terminal:__entity__ region:__entity__ of PC4:__entity__ , and the subunit:__entity__ interaction:__entity__ subdomain:__entity__ of the highly:__entity__ conserved:__entity__ DNA:__entity__ binding-subunit:__entity__ interaction:__entity__ domain:__entity__ ( DBD:__entity__ ) of NF-YA:__entity__ .
These results suggest that in class II+ mature B-cells NF-Y:__entity__ is associated with the protein cofactor , PC4:__entity__ , which may play an important role in NF-Y-mediated transcriptional control of class:__entity__ II:__entity__ genes:__entity__ .
Arrest of B lymphocyte terminal differentiation by CD40 signaling : mechanism for lack of antibody-secreting cells in germinal centers .
Despite extensive research , the role of CD40:__entity__ signaling in B cell terminal differentiation remains controversial .
Here we show that CD40:__entity__ engagement arrests B cell differentiation prior to plasma cell formation .
This arrest is manifested at a molecular level as a reduction in mRNA levels of secretory immunoglobulin gene products such as mu ( s ) and J chain as well as the loss of the transcriptional:__entity__ regulator:__entity__ BLIMP-1:__entity__ .
Furthermore , the inhibition of B cell differentiation by CD40:__entity__ engagement could not be overcome by either mitogens:__entity__ or cytokines:__entity__ , but could be reversed by antibodies that interfere with the CD40:__entity__ / gp39:__entity__ interaction .
These data suggest that secretory immunoglobulin is not produced by B cells that are actively engaged by gp39-expressing T cells .
A positively charged alpha-lipoic acid analogue with increased cellular uptake and more potent immunomodulatory activity .
alpha-Lipoic acid ( LA ) is taken up by cells and reduced to its potent dithiol form , dihydrolipoate ( DHLA ) , much of which is rapidly effluxed out from cells .
To improve retention in cells , the LA molecule was modified to confer a positive charge at physiological pH .
N , N-dimethyl , N'-2-amidoethyl-lipoate was synthesized .
The protonated form of the new molecule is referred to as LA-Plus .
The uptake of LA-Plus by human Wurzburg T cells was higher compared to that of LA .
Several-fold higher amounts of DHLA-Plus , the corresponding reduced form of LA-Plus , were detected in LA-Plus treated cells compared to the amount of DHLA found in cells treated with LA .
At 100 microM , LA did not but LA-Plus inhibited H2O2 induced NF-kappaB:__entity__ activation and NF-kappaB:__entity__ directed IL-2:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ expression .
Both LA and LA-Plus synergised with selenium in inhibiting H2O2 induced NF-kappaB:__entity__ activation .
At 150 microM LA-Plus , but not LA , inhibited TNFalpha:__entity__ induced NF-kappaB:__entity__ activation .
At 5 microM LA-Plus , but not LA , protected against both spontaneous and etoposide induced apoptosis in rat thymocytes .
LA-Plus is thus an improved form of LA with increased therapeutic potential .

Carrier identification in X-linked immunodeficiency diseases .
OBJECTIVE : Carrier identification in X-linked immunodeficiency disorders can be based on the demonstration of non-random X inactivation ( NRXI ) in affected blood cell lineages when growth is impaired in cells expressing the abnormal:__entity__ gene:__entity__ .
We examined the utility of seeking evidence of NRXI to test the carrier status of women in families affected by X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency ( XSCID ) and X-linked hypogammaglobulinaemia ( XLH ) , to identify as carriers the mothers of boys with SCID or hypogammaglobulinaemia whose phenotype suggested X-linkage and to infer X-linkage in boys with SCID or hypogammaglobulinaemia whose disease was not clearly X-linked on the basis either of family history or clinical and immunological characteristics .
METHODOLOGY : A polymerase chain reaction-based method was used to amplify a polymorphic CAG:__entity__ repeat:__entity__ in the first:__entity__ exon:__entity__ of the androgen:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ gene:__entity__ after selective digestion of the active:__entity__ X:__entity__ chromosome:__entity__ with a methylation-sensitive:__entity__ enzyme:__entity__ , HpaII:__entity__ to distinguish between the paternal:__entity__ and:__entity__ maternal:__entity__ alleles:__entity__ and to identify their methylation status .
RESULTS : Heterozygosity was found in 24 of 31 female subjects ( 77 % ) .
As anticipated , NRXI could be demonstrated in all lymphoid cells studied from obligate carriers of XSCID and an obligate carrier of XLH but not on a carrier of X-linked immunodeficiency with hyper-IgM:__entity__ .
The finding of NRXI in the mother of a boy with a SCID variant showed her to be a carrier of XSCID and establishes that her son has XSCID , not otherwise evident from available data .
CONCLUSIONS : This PCR assay provides a rapid method for carrier detection of X-linked immunodeficiencies , and has allowed us to expand the phenotype of XSCID
Leukocyte-endothelial interaction is augmented by high glucose concentrations and hyperglycemia in a NF-kB-dependent fashion .
We addressed the role of hyperglycemia in leukocyte-endothelium interaction under flow conditions by exposing human umbilical vein endothelial cells for 24 h to normal ( 5 mM ) , high concentration of glucose ( 30 mM ) , advanced glycosylation end product-albumin:__entity__ ( 100 microg/ml ) , or hyperglycemic ( 174-316 mg/dl ) sera from patients with diabetes and abnormal hemoglobin A1c ( 8.1+/-1.4 % ) .
At the end of incubation endothelial cells were perfused with total leukocyte suspension in a parallel plate flow chamber under laminar flow ( 1.5 dyn/cm2 ) .
Rolling and adherent cells were evaluated by digital image processing .
Results showed that 30 mM glucose significantly ( P < 0.01 ) increased the number of adherent leukocytes to endothelial cells in respect to control ( 5 mM glucose ; 151+/-19 versus 33+/-8 cells/mm2 ) .
A similar response was induced by endothelial stimulation with IL-1beta:__entity__ , here used as positive control ( 195+/-20 cells/mm2 ) .
The number of rolling cells on endothelial surface was not affected by high glucose level .
Stable adhesion of leukocytes to glucose-treated as well as to IL-1beta-stimulated endothelial cells was preceded by short interaction of leukocytes with the endothelial surface .
The distance travelled by leukocytes before arrest on 30 mM glucose , or on IL-1beta-treated endothelial cells , was significantly ( P < 0.01 ) higher than that observed for leukocytes adhering on control endothelium ( 30 mM glucose : 76.7+/-3.5 ; IL1beta : 69.7+/-4 versus 5 mM glucose : 21.5+/-5 microm ) .
Functional blocking of E-selectin:__entity__ , intercellular:__entity__ cell:__entity__ adhesion:__entity__ molecule-1:__entity__ , and vascular:__entity__ cell:__entity__ adhesion:__entity__ molecule-1:__entity__ on endothelial cells with the corresponding mouse:__entity__ mAb:__entity__ significantly inhibited glucose-induced increase in leukocyte adhesion ( 67+/-16 , 83+/-12 , 62+/-8 versus 144+/-21 cells/ mm2 ) .
Confocal fluorescence microscopy studies showed that 30 mM glucose induced an increase in endothelial surface expression of E-selectin:__entity__ , intercellular:__entity__ cell:__entity__ adhesion:__entity__ molecule-1:__entity__ , and vascular:__entity__ cell:__entity__ adhesion:__entity__ molecule-1:__entity__ .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay of nuclear extracts of human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) exposed for 1 h to 30 mM glucose revealed an intense NF-kB:__entity__ activation .
Treatment of HUVEC exposed to high glucose with the NF-kB:__entity__ inhibitors:__entity__ pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate ( 100 microM ) and tosyl-phe-chloromethylketone ( 25 microM ) significantly reduced ( P < 0.05 ) leukocyte adhesion in respect to HUVEC treated with glucose alone .
A significant ( P < 0.01 ) inhibitory effect on glucose-induced leukocyte adhesion was observed after blocking protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ C:__entity__ activity with staurosporine ( 5 nM ) .
When HUVEC were treated with specific antisense oligodesoxynucleotides against PKCalpha:__entity__ and:__entity__ PKCepsilon:__entity__ isoforms:__entity__ before the addition of 30 mM glucose , a significant ( P < 0.05 ) reduction in the adhesion was also seen .
Advanced glycosylation end product-albumin:__entity__ significantly increased the number of adhering leukocytes in respect to native:__entity__ albumin:__entity__ used as control ( 110+/-16 versus 66+/-7 , P < 0.01 ) .
Sera from diabetic patients significantly ( P < 0.01 ) enhanced leukocyte adhesion as compared with controls , despite normal levels of IL-1beta:__entity__ and TNFalpha:__entity__ in these sera .
These data indicate that high glucose concentration and hyperglycemia promote leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium through upregulation of cell surface expression of adhesive proteins , possibly depending on NF-kB:__entity__ activation .
Ikaros:__entity__ in hemopoietic lineage determination and homeostasis .
Studies on the molecular mechanisms that control hemopoietic differentiation have focused on signaling cascades and nuclear effectors that drive this complex developmental system in a regulated fashion .
Here we review the role of Ikaros:__entity__ , the founding member of a unique family of zinc:__entity__ finger:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ in this developmental process .
Studies on an Ikaros:__entity__ null mutation have revealed an essential role for this factor in lymphoid cell fate determination and at subsequent branch points of the T cell differentiation pathway .
Differences in the phenotypes of a null and a dominant:__entity__ negative:__entity__ (:__entity__ DN:__entity__ ):__entity__ Ikaros:__entity__ mutation:__entity__ provide insight into a regulatory network through which Ikaros:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ exert their effects in development .
In addition a comparative analysis of the hemopoietic stem cell and precursor compartment resulting from the two Ikaros:__entity__ mutations:__entity__ reveals a profound yet not absolute requirement for Ikaros:__entity__
Induction of early:__entity__ B:__entity__ cell:__entity__ factor:__entity__ ( EBF:__entity__ ) and multiple:__entity__ B:__entity__ lineage:__entity__ genes:__entity__ by the basic:__entity__ helix-loop-helix:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ E12:__entity__ .
The transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ encoded by the E2A:__entity__ and early:__entity__ B:__entity__ cell:__entity__ factor:__entity__ ( EBF:__entity__ ) genes are required for the proper development of B lymphocytes .
However , the absence of B lineage cells in E2A- and EBF-deficient mice has made it difficult to determine the function or relationship between these proteins .
We report the identification of a novel model system in which the role of E2A:__entity__ and EBF:__entity__ in the regulation of multiple B lineage traits can be studied .
We found that the conversion of 70Z/3 pre-B lymphocytes to cells with a macrophage-like phenotype is associated with the loss of E2A:__entity__ and EBF:__entity__ .
Moreover , we show that ectopic expression of the E2A:__entity__ protein E12:__entity__ in this macrophage line results in the induction of many:__entity__ B:__entity__ lineage:__entity__ genes:__entity__ , including EBF:__entity__ , IL7Ralpha:__entity__ , lambda5:__entity__ , and Rag-1 , and the ability to induce kappa:__entity__ light:__entity__ chain:__entity__ in response to mitogen .
Activation of EBF:__entity__ may be one of the critical functions of E12:__entity__ in regulating the B lineage phenotype since expression of EBF:__entity__ alone leads to the activation of a subset of E12:__entity__ -inducible traits .
Our data demonstrate that , in the context of this macrophage line , E12:__entity__ induces expression of EBF:__entity__ and together these transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ coordinately regulate numerous B:__entity__ lineage-associated:__entity__ genes:__entity__ .
Activation-induced down-regulation of retinoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ RXRalpha:__entity__ expression in human T lymphocytes .
Role of cell cycle regulation .
A 5.4-kilobase:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ , the expression of which is down-regulated after treatment of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) with various T cell-activating agents , was isolated using an mRNA differential display method .
Nucleotide sequence analysis identified the 5:__entity__ ':__entity__ end:__entity__ of this RNA:__entity__ as human:__entity__ retinoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ RXRalpha:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ .
Here , we report the nucleotide sequence of 3.6:__entity__ kilobases:__entity__ of this RNA , which represents the 3:__entity__ ':__entity__ end:__entity__ of RXRalpha:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ , the sequence of which has not been previously described .
Activated PBMCs also expressed lower levels of RXRalpha:__entity__ protein , and a DNA binding assay showed that the activation-induced loss of RXRalpha:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ and protein expression correlated with the loss of DNA binding activity of this protein .
We present evidence that the transition from G0/G1 to S phase of the cell cycle results in the down-regulation of RXRalpha:__entity__ expression and that cell cycle inhibitors , which block the cells in G1 phase , prevent this down-regulation .
The decrease in the levels of RXRalpha:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ was found to be regulated at the post-transcriptional level and involved new protein synthesis .
These observations indicate that the levels of RXRalpha:__entity__ expression in T lymphocytes are coupled to cell cycle progression , and there is tight regulatory control of RXRalpha:__entity__ expression during the transition from G0/G1 to S phase of the cell cycle .
Epidemiology and pathogenesis of AIDS-related lymphomas .
Among patients with congenital and acquired immunodeficiencies , non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHLs ) are the most common tumors of the immune system .
In the setting of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection , as many as 10 % to 20 % of people ultimately developed NHLs .
These tumors are clinically aggressive , frequently involve extranodal sites , and often exhibit unique features that distinguish them from NHL arising in individuals with other forms of immunosuppression .
Important in the development of HIV-associated NHL are cytokines:__entity__ and other factors that induce B-cell proliferation and increase the likelihood of mutations of c-myc:__entity__ , bcl-6:__entity__ , and other tumor-suppressor:__entity__ genes:__entity__ with carcinogenic potential .
Specific forms of HIV-associated NHL are linked to expression of Epstein-Barr:__entity__ virus:__entity__ (:__entity__ EBV:__entity__ ):__entity__ -latent:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ ; the newly described DNA virus , Karposi 's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus/human herpesvirus-8 ( KSHV/HHV-8 ) ; and perhaps HIV .
Elucidation of the factors that contribute to the high incidence of NHL among patients infected with HIV provides insights into important elements of lymphomagenesis .
Matrix:__entity__ metalloproteinase:__entity__ expression in human breast cancer : an immunohistochemical study including correlation with cathepsin:__entity__ D:__entity__ , type:__entity__ IV:__entity__ collagen:__entity__ , laminin:__entity__ , fibronectin:__entity__ , EGFR:__entity__ , c-erbB-2:__entity__ oncoprotein:__entity__ , p53:__entity__ , steroid receptors status and proliferative indices .
Matrix:__entity__ metalloproteinase:__entity__ s ( MMPs:__entity__ ) are a group of enzymes thought to be responsible for both normal connective tissue matrix remodelling and accelerated breakdown associated with tumour development .
The current study aimed to investigate the immunohistochemical expression of matrix:__entity__ metalloproteinase:__entity__ 3:__entity__ ( MMP-3:__entity__ , stromelysin-1:__entity__ ) in correlation with the expression of Basement:__entity__ Membrane:__entity__ (:__entity__ BM:__entity__ ):__entity__ antigen:__entity__ ( type:__entity__ IV:__entity__ collagen:__entity__ , laminin:__entity__ ) , fibronectin:__entity__ , cathepsin:__entity__ D:__entity__ , p53:__entity__ , c-erbB-2:__entity__ , proliferative activity ( Ki-67:__entity__ , PCNA:__entity__ ) , steroid receptor content as well as to the other conventional clinicopathological parameters in breast cancer .
This study was performed on a series of frozen and paraffin sections from 84 breast cancer specimens by immunohistochemistry using the monoclonal:__entity__ antibody:__entity__ MMP-3:__entity__ ( Ab-1:__entity__ ) .
Stromelysin-1:__entity__ ( ST1:__entity__ ) was observed in about 10 % of epithelial cells in the control groups ( cases of fibrocystic and benign proliferative breast disease ) , while expression ( > 10 % of expression ) was detected in 89.7 % of tumours .
The expression of ST1:__entity__ in carcinoma cells was strongly associated with its presence in the stroma ( p < 0.001 ) .
A significantly positive correlation was found between ST1:__entity__ expression , and p53:__entity__ tumour suppressor gene product ( p = 0.004 ) , and a relationship with c-erbB-2:__entity__ protein and progesterone receptor status was also indicated .
These findings suggest that ST1:__entity__ expression in breast cancer tissue is irrespective of the expression of the extracellular matrix component , the proteolytic:__entity__ enzyme:__entity__ cathepsin:__entity__ D:__entity__ and the growth fraction of the tumour , and that it could be a potential new prognostic marker in breast cancer .
Use of transfected liver cells to evaluate potential mechanisms of alcohol-induced liver injury [ see comments ]
There is increased activity of the proinflammatory:__entity__ cytokine:__entity__ , tumor:__entity__ necrosis:__entity__ factor:__entity__ ( TNF:__entity__ ) in alcoholic liver disease ( ALD ) .
Hepatic neutrophil infiltration is a principal injurious manifestation of ALD .
TNF:__entity__ can induce cellular oxidative injury directly , and indirectly by inducing neutrophil chemotactic factor ( IL-8:__entity__ ) production by hepatocytes .
IL-8:__entity__ activates and chemotactically attracts neutrophils to the liver where they release oxidizing substances .
Patients with ALD also have decreased protective:__entity__ factors:__entity__ for cellular oxidative injury .
Manganous:__entity__ superoxide:__entity__ dismutase:__entity__ ( MnSOD:__entity__ ) is an antioxidant:__entity__ protective:__entity__ factor:__entity__ .
The objectives of these studies were to investigate mechanisms for induction of an injurious:__entity__ factor:__entity__ ( IL-8:__entity__ ) and a protective:__entity__ factor:__entity__ ( MnSOD:__entity__ ) in the HepG2 human hepatoma cell line .
In the first set of experiments , IL-8:__entity__ gene:__entity__ reporter:__entity__ constructs:__entity__ were used to transiently transfect a derivative ( MVh2E1-9 ) of the HepG2 cell line which expresses P-4502E1:__entity__ and metabolizes ethanol .
Inactivation of the NF-kappaB:__entity__ and:__entity__ 3'NF-IL-6:__entity__ DNA:__entity__ binding:__entity__ sites:__entity__ decreased IL-8:__entity__ gene:__entity__ transcriptional activation in response to TNF:__entity__ while inactivation of the 5'NF-IL-6:__entity__ binding:__entity__ site:__entity__ increased IL-8:__entity__ gene:__entity__ transcriptional activity in response to TNF:__entity__ .
This system may be useful to assess the effects of ethanol on TNF:__entity__ -induced hepatocyte IL-8:__entity__ production .
In the second set of experiments , HepG2 cells were cultured in 25 to 100 mmol concentrations of ethanol .
Both TNF:__entity__ and ethanol increased HepG2 cell MnSOD:__entity__ activity in short-term ( 72 hr ) cultures with ethanol .
However , after long-term ( 10 weeks ) culture with ethanol , there was no induction of MnSOD:__entity__ by ethanol and there was a diminished induction of MnSOD:__entity__ in response to TNF:__entity__ .
Further studies are needed to assess the effect of this diminished induction of MnSOD:__entity__ with chronic ethanol culture on HepG2 cell susceptibility to TNF cytotoxicity .
We conclude that transfected liver cell lines can be used to evaluate mechanisms for increased injurious:__entity__ factors:__entity__ and decreased protective:__entity__ factors:__entity__ in alcoholic liver injury .
Tissue factor transcription driven by Egr-1:__entity__ is a critical mechanism of murine:__entity__ pulmonary:__entity__ fibrin:__entity__ deposition in hypoxia .
Local hypoxemia and stasis trigger thrombosis .
We have demonstrated previously that in a murine model of normobaric hypoxia pulmonary fibrin:__entity__ deposition is a result of expression of tissue:__entity__ factor:__entity__ , especially in oxygen-deprived:__entity__ mononuclear:__entity__ phagocytes:__entity__ ( MPs:__entity__ ) .
We now show that transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ early-growth-response:__entity__ gene:__entity__ product:__entity__ ( Egr-1:__entity__ ) is rapidly activated in hypoxia , both in vitro and in vivo , and is responsible for transcription and expression of tissue:__entity__ factor:__entity__ in hypoxic lung .
MPs:__entity__ and HeLa cells subjected to hypoxia ( pO2 approximately 13 torr ) had increased levels of tissue:__entity__ factor:__entity__ transcripts:__entity__ ( approximately 18-fold ) and an increased rate of transcription ( approximately 15-fold ) , based on nuclear run-on analysis .
Gel-shift analysis of nuclear extracts from hypoxic:__entity__ MPs:__entity__ and HeLa cells demonstrated increased DNA-binding activity at the serum:__entity__ response:__entity__ region:__entity__ ( SRR ; -111/+14 bp ) of the tissue:__entity__ factor:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ at Egr-1:__entity__ motifs:__entity__ .
Using 32P-labeled Egr consensus oligonucleotide , we observed induction of DNA-binding activity in nuclear extracts from hypoxic lung and HeLa cells because of activation of Egr-1:__entity__ , by means of supershift analysis .
Transient transfection of HeLa cells with chimeric:__entity__ plasmids:__entity__ containing wild-type:__entity__ or:__entity__ mutant:__entity__ SRR:__entity__ from the tissue:__entity__ factor:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ showed that intact:__entity__ Sp1:__entity__ sites:__entity__ are necessary for basal promoter activity , whereas the integrity of Egr-1:__entity__ sites:__entity__ was required for hypoxia-enhanced expression .
A central role for Egr-1:__entity__ in hypoxia-mediated tissue factor expression was confirmed by experiments with homozygous Egr-1:__entity__ null mice ; wild-type mice subjected to oxygen:__entity__ deprivation:__entity__ expressed:__entity__ tissue:__entity__ factor:__entity__ and showed fibrin:__entity__ deposition , but hypoxic homozygous Egr-1:__entity__ null mice displayed neither tissue:__entity__ factor:__entity__ nor fibrin:__entity__ .
These data delineate a novel biology for hypoxia-induced fibrin:__entity__ deposition , in which oxygen deprivation-induced activation of Egr-1:__entity__ , resulting in expression of tissue:__entity__ factor:__entity__ , has an unexpected and central role .
Kinetics of cytokine and NFAT gene expression in human interleukin-2-dependent T lymphoblasts stimulated via T-cell:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ .
T cells respond to mitogenic or antigenic stimulation by proliferation and by turning on cytokine gene expression .
Here we have analysed the kinetics and nature of cytokine production in human peripheral blood-derived T lymphoblasts stimulated with anti-CD3:__entity__ antibodies:__entity__ or Lens:__entity__ culinaris:__entity__ lectin:__entity__ ( LCL:__entity__ ) .
T cells were purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) and primarily activated with anti-CD3:__entity__ antibodies:__entity__ and cultured in the presence of interleukin-2:__entity__ ( IL-2:__entity__ ) .
Anti-CD3-restimulated T cells ( mainly CD8+ ) produced IL-2:__entity__ , interferon-gamma:__entity__ ( IFN-gamma:__entity__ ) and tumour:__entity__ necrosis:__entity__ factor-alpha:__entity__ ( TNF-alpha:__entity__ ) and low levels of IL-4:__entity__ and:__entity__ IL-10:__entity__ transcripts:__entity__ and proteins .
No IL-6:__entity__ gene:__entity__ expression was observed .
In LCL-stimulated cells the cytokine production pattern was very similar .
Steady-state mRNA levels of IL-2:__entity__ , IL-10:__entity__ and IFN-gamma:__entity__ peaked at 3 hr after anti-CD3 stimulation and declined rapidly thereafter .
The kinetics of TNF-alpha:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ expression was faster , being at its peak level 1 hr after stimulation .
Anti-CD3-stimulated IL-2:__entity__ gene:__entity__ expression was down-regulated by protein synthesis inhibitor , whereas IL-10:__entity__ ,:__entity__ IFN-gamma:__entity__ and:__entity__ TNF-alpha:__entity__ genes:__entity__ were readily induced independent of ongoing protein synthesis .
T-cell:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ stimulation also induced a very rapid expression of c-jun:__entity__ ,:__entity__ c-fos:__entity__ and:__entity__ NFATc1:__entity__ (:__entity__ NFATc:__entity__ ):__entity__ genes:__entity__ , the gene products of which are involved in cytokine gene expression .
In conclusion , the cytokines:__entity__ synthesized by IL-2-dependent T cells were predominantly IL-2:__entity__ , IFN-gamma:__entity__ and TNF-alpha:__entity__ .
An animal model to study local oxidation of LDL and its biological effects in the arterial wall .
Oxidized LDL ( oxLDL ) is present in atherosclerotic lesions and is believed to play a key role in atherogenesis .
Mainly on the basis of cell culture studies , oxLDL has been shown to produce many biological effects that influence the atherosclerotic process .
To study LDL oxidation in vivo , we have established a model in which Sprague-Dawley rats are given a single injection of unmodified human LDL ( > or = 4 mg/kg body weight ) .
Within 6 hours , an accumulation of apolipoprotein B and epitopes:__entity__ present on oxLDL are detected in the arterial endothelium and media .
The presence of oxLDL is associated with activation of the transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ nuclear:__entity__ factor-kappaB:__entity__ in the endothelium as well as endothelial expression of intercellular:__entity__ adhesion:__entity__ molecule-1:__entity__ .
Injection of LDL enriched with the antioxidant probucol resulted in arterial accumulation of apolipoprotein B , but the expression of oxLDL-specific epitopes was reduced at 24 hours .
Thus , this simple model has the potential to analyze the mechanisms behind and biological effects of LDL oxidation in vivo .
Molecular mechanisms of promoter regulation of the gp34:__entity__ gene:__entity__ that is trans-activated by an oncoprotein:__entity__ Tax:__entity__ of human T cell leukemia virus type I .
We investigated the molecular mechanism of transcriptional activation of the gp34:__entity__ gene:__entity__ by the Tax:__entity__ oncoprotein:__entity__ of human T cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) .
gp34:__entity__ is a type:__entity__ II:__entity__ transmembrane:__entity__ molecule:__entity__ belonging to the tumor necrosis factor family and is constitutively expressed on HTLV-I-producing cells but not normal resting T cells .
The transcriptional regulatory region of the gp34:__entity__ gene:__entity__ was activated by HTLV-I Tax:__entity__ in the human T cell line Jurkat , in which endogenous gp34:__entity__ is induced by Tax:__entity__ .
Sequence analysis demonstrated that two NF-kappaB-like:__entity__ elements:__entity__ ( 1 and 2 ) were present in the regulatory:__entity__ region:__entity__ .
Both NF-kappaB-like:__entity__ elements:__entity__ were able to bind to NF-kappaB:__entity__ or its related factor ( s ) in a Tax:__entity__ -dependent manner .
Chloramphenicol:__entity__ acetyltransferase:__entity__ assays indicated that NF-kappaB-like:__entity__ element:__entity__ 1:__entity__ was Tax:__entity__ -responsive , although the activity was lower than that the native:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ .
NF-kappaB:__entity__ -like element 2 elevated promoter activity when combined with NF-kappaB-like:__entity__ element:__entity__ 1:__entity__ , indicating cooperative function of the elements for maximum promoter function .
Unlike typical NF-kappaB:__entity__ elements:__entity__ , the NF-kappaB-like:__entity__ elements:__entity__ in gp34:__entity__ were not activated by treatment of Jurkat cells with phorbol ester despite induction of the NF-kappaB:__entity__ -like binding activity .
Chloramphenicol:__entity__ acetyltransferase:__entity__ reporter assays using the region upstream of the NF-kappaB-like:__entity__ elements:__entity__ identified an upstream region that reduced transcription from cognate:__entity__ and:__entity__ noncognate:__entity__ core:__entity__ promoters:__entity__ in a Tax-independent manner .
Our results imply complex regulation of expression of the gp34:__entity__ gene:__entity__ and suggest implication of gp34:__entity__ in proliferation of HTLV-I infected T cells .
beta-Amyloid:__entity__ fibrils:__entity__ activate parallel mitogen-activated:__entity__ protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ pathways in microglia and THP1 monocytes .
The senile plaques of Alzheimer 's disease are foci of local inflammatory responses , as evidenced by the presence of acute:__entity__ phase:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ and oxidative damage .
Fibrillar:__entity__ forms:__entity__ of beta-amyloid:__entity__ ( Abeta:__entity__ ) , which are the primary constituents of senile plaques , have been shown to activate tyrosine kinase-dependent signal transduction cascades , resulting in inflammatory responses in microglia .
However , the downstream signaling pathways mediating Abeta:__entity__ -induced inflammatory events are not well characterized .
We report that exposure of primary rat microglia and human THP1 monocytes to fibrillar:__entity__ Abeta:__entity__ results in the tyrosine:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ -dependent activation of two parallel signal transduction cascades involving members of the mitogen-activated:__entity__ protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ (:__entity__ MAPK:__entity__ ):__entity__ superfamily:__entity__ .
Abeta:__entity__ stimulated the rapid , transient activation of extracellular:__entity__ signal-regulated:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ 1:__entity__ ( ERK1:__entity__ ) and ERK2:__entity__ in microglia and ERK2:__entity__ in THP1 monocytes .
A second superfamily:__entity__ member:__entity__ , p38:__entity__ MAPK:__entity__ , was also activated with similar kinetics .
Scavenger:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ and receptor:__entity__ for:__entity__ advanced:__entity__ glycated:__entity__ end:__entity__ products:__entity__ ( RAGE:__entity__ ) ligands failed to activate ERK:__entity__ and p38:__entity__ MAPK:__entity__ in the absence of significant increases in protein tyrosine phosphorylation , demonstrating that scavenger:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ and RAGE:__entity__ are not linked to these pathways .
Importantly , the stress-activated:__entity__ protein:__entity__ kinases:__entity__ ( SAPKs:__entity__ ) were not significantly activated in response to Abeta:__entity__ .
Downstream effectors of the MAPK signal transduction cascades include MAPKAP:__entity__ kinases:__entity__ , such as RSK1:__entity__ and RSK2:__entity__ , as well as transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ .
Exposure of microglia and THP1 monocytes to Abeta:__entity__ resulted in the activation of RSK1:__entity__ and RSK2:__entity__ and phosphorylation of cAMP:__entity__ response:__entity__ element-binding:__entity__ protein:__entity__ at Ser133 , providing a mechanism for Abeta:__entity__ -induced changes in gene expression
Regulation of cellular:__entity__ retinoic:__entity__ acid:__entity__ binding:__entity__ protein:__entity__ ( CRABP:__entity__ II:__entity__ ) during human monocyte differentiation in vitro .
Cellular:__entity__ retinoic:__entity__ acid:__entity__ binding:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ ( CRABP:__entity__ ) are low:__entity__ molecular:__entity__ weight:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ whose precise function remains unknown .
They bind retinoids and may thereby modulate the intracellular steady-state concentration of retinoids .
Whereas CRABP:__entity__ I:__entity__ is ubiquitously expressed , CRABP:__entity__ II:__entity__ is mainly detected in various cell types of the skin .
By representative difference analysis we found that CRABP:__entity__ II:__entity__ is also strongly expressed in human monocyte-derived macrophages ( MAC ) but not in freshly isolated monocytes ( MO ) .
The CRABP:__entity__ II:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ was gradually upregulated during differentiation from MO to MAC in the presence of 2 % serum .
Adherence , which is important for MO differentiation , induced CRABP:__entity__ II:__entity__ expression , but the addition of 10 ( -7 ) M retinoic acid inhibited the upregulation of CRABP:__entity__ II:__entity__ expression during MO/MAC differentiation .
As MO can differentiate along the classical pathway not only to MAC but also to dendritic cells we analyzed the expression of CRABP:__entity__ II:__entity__ in MO-derived dendritic cells cultured with 10 % FCS:__entity__ , IL-4:__entity__ , and GM-CSF:__entity__ .
In contrast to MAC , MO-derived dendritic cells showed an extremely low expression of CRABP:__entity__ II:__entity__ .
From these results we conclude ( 1 ) that the availability and the metabolism of retinoids may be different in MAC compared to MO and dendritic cells and ( 2 ) that this may influence differentiation and activation of those cells .
Transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ B-cell-specific:__entity__ activator:__entity__ protein:__entity__ ( BSAP:__entity__ ) is differentially expressed in B cells and in subsets of B-cell lymphomas .
The paired:__entity__ box:__entity__ containing:__entity__ gene:__entity__ PAX-5:__entity__ encodes the transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ BSAP:__entity__ ( B-cell-specific:__entity__ activator:__entity__ protein:__entity__ ) , which plays a key role in B-lymphocyte development .
Despite its known involvement in a rare subtype of non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) , a detailed examination of BSAP:__entity__ expression in NHL has not been previously reported .
In this study , we analyzed normal and malignant lymphoid tissues and cell lines , including 102 cases of B-cell NHL , 23 cases of T- and null-cell NHL , and 18 cases of Hodgkin 's disease .
Normal lymphoid tissues showed strong nuclear BSAP:__entity__ expression in mantle zone B cells , less intense reactivity in follicular center B cells , and no expression in cells of the T-cell-rich zones .
Monocytoid B cells showed weak expression , whereas plasma cells and extrafollicular large transformed B cells were negative .
Of the 102 B-cell NHLs , 83 ( 81 % ) demonstrated BSAP:__entity__ expression .
All of the 13 ( 100 % ) B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias ( B-CLLs ) , 21 of ( 100 % ) mantle cells ( MCLs ) , and 20 of 21 ( 95 % ) follicular lymphomas ( FLs ) were positive .
Moderate staining intensities were found in most B-CLL and FL cases , whereas most MCLs showed strong reactions , paralleling the strong reactivity of nonmalignant mantle cells .
Eight of 12 ( 67 % ) marginal zone lymphoma cases showed negative or low BSAP:__entity__ levels , and 17 of 24 ( 71 % ) large B-cell lymphomas displayed moderate to strong expression .
None of the 23 T- and null-cell lymphomas reacted with the BSAP:__entity__ antisera , whereas in Hodgkin 's disease , 2 of 4 ( 50 % ) nodular lymphocytic predominance and 5 of 14 ( 36 % ) classical cases showed weak nuclear or nucleolar BSAP:__entity__ reactions in a fraction of the tumor cells .
Western blot analysis showed a 52-kD BSAP:__entity__ band in B-cell lines , but not in non-B-cell or plasma cell lines .
We conclude that BSAP:__entity__ expression is largely restricted to lymphomas of B-cell lineage and that BSAP:__entity__ expression varies in B-cell subsets and subtypes of B-cell NHL .
The high levels of BSAP:__entity__ , especially those found in large-cell lymphomas and in some follicular lymphomas , may be a consequence of deregulated gene expression and suggest a possible involvement of PAX-5:__entity__ in certain B-cell malignancies .
This is a US government work .

Mitogen and growth factor-induced activation of a STAT-like:__entity__ molecule:__entity__ in channel catfish lymphoid cells .
This article describes the identification of a putative:__entity__ STAT:__entity__ molecule:__entity__ in the channel catfish ( Ictalurus punctatus ) , the first report of such a molecule in a 'lower ' vertebrate .
A monoclonal:__entity__ antibody:__entity__ against human:__entity__ STAT6:__entity__ recognizes an approximately 100:__entity__ kDa:__entity__ molecule:__entity__ that becomes activated and translocates to the nucleus upon both growth factor and mitogen stimulation of catfish leukocytes .
This presumed catfish:__entity__ STAT:__entity__ binds the mammalian:__entity__ interferon-gamma:__entity__ activation:__entity__ site:__entity__ , a known motif of mammalian STAT binding , as shown by electromobility shift assays .
Purification of the proteins present in these DNA:__entity__ complexes:__entity__ confirms that the catfish reactive molecule binds to the interferon-gamma:__entity__ activation:__entity__ site:__entity__ sequence:__entity__ .
These results suggest that STAT:__entity__ molecules:__entity__ have been highly conserved in vertebrate evolution .
Isolation and analysis of a T cell clone variant exhibiting constitutively phosphorylated:__entity__ Ser133:__entity__ cAMP:__entity__ response:__entity__ element-binding:__entity__ protein:__entity__ .
In driving T cell proliferation , IL-2:__entity__ stimulates a new program of gene expression that includes proliferating:__entity__ cell:__entity__ nuclear:__entity__ antigen:__entity__ ( PCNA:__entity__ ) , a requisite processivity factor for DNA:__entity__ polymerase:__entity__ delta:__entity__ .
PCNA:__entity__ transcription is regulated in part through tandem CRE:__entity__ sequences:__entity__ in the promoter:__entity__ and:__entity__ CRE:__entity__ binding:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ ; IL-2:__entity__ stimulates CREB phosphorylation in the resting cloned T lymphocyte , L2 .
After culturing L2 cells for greater than 91 days , we consistently isolate a stable variant that exhibits constitutive CREB phosphorylation .
L2 and L2 variant cells were tested for IL-2:__entity__ responsiveness and rapamycin sensitivity with respect to specific kinase activity , PCNA expression and proliferation .
In L2 cells , IL-2:__entity__ stimulated and rapamycin inhibited the following : cAMP-independent CREB:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ activity , PCNA expression and proliferation .
In L2 variant cells , CREB:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ activity was constitutively high ; IL-2:__entity__ stimulated and rapamycin blocked PCNA expression and proliferation .
These results indicate that IL-2:__entity__ induces a rapamycin-sensitive , cAMP-independent CREB:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ activity in L2 cells .
However , phosphorylation of CREB:__entity__ alone is not sufficient to drive PCNA:__entity__ expression and L2 cell proliferation in the absence of IL-2:__entity__ .
Serotonin derivative , N- ( p-coumaroyl ) serotonin , inhibits the production of TNF-alpha:__entity__ , IL-1alpha:__entity__ , IL-1beta:__entity__ , and IL-6:__entity__ by endotoxin-stimulated human blood monocytes .
We have reported that N- ( p-coumaroyl ) serotonin ( CS ) and its derivatives with antioxidative activity are present in safflower seeds .
As reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) are implicated in the signaling of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , we examined whether CS has a suppressive effect on inflammatory:__entity__ cytokine:__entity__ generation from human monocyte s in vitro .
CS at 50-200 microM reduced tumor:__entity__ necrosis:__entity__ factor:__entity__ ( TNF:__entity__ ) , interleukin-1:__entity__ ( IL-1:__entity__ ) , and IL-6:__entity__ activities in the culture supernatants from LPS-stimulated human blood monocytes without cytotoxicity .
ELISA assay revealed that the production of TNF-alpha:__entity__ , IL-1alpha:__entity__ , IL-1beta:__entity__ , and IL-6:__entity__ was inhibited by CS .
Northern blot analysis showed that LPS-induced expression of these cytokine:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ in monocytes was suppressed by CS .
NF-kappaB activation was also inhibited by CS .
These findings indicate that CS has a suppressive effect on proinflammatory cytokine production from monocytes , and this effect is based in part on the suppression of cytokine:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ expression through inhibition of NF-kappaB:__entity__ activation .
Elevated expression of differentiation:__entity__ inhibitory:__entity__ factor:__entity__ nm23:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ in monoblastic crisis of a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia .
Differentiation:__entity__ inhibitory:__entity__ factor:__entity__ nm23:__entity__ gene:__entity__ has been found to be expressed in high quantities in acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) , especially in acute monocytic leukemia ( AML-M5 ) and is suggested as a new prognostic factor in AML-M5 .
We report an example of elevated expression of nm23:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ in a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) who developed monoblastic crisis .
Relative levels of nm23-H1:__entity__ and:__entity__ -H2:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ extracted from the patient 's peripheral blood mononuclear cells and bone marrow mononuclear cells were measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction .
The level of nm23-H1:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ in CML cells at the chronic phase was as high as that in bone marrow cells from healthy volunteers .
The mRNA level of nm23-H2:__entity__ was slightly below the normal level .
At blastic crisis , however , expression of both nm23-H1:__entity__ and:__entity__ -H2:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ was elevated to about three to nine times of that at the chronic phase .
Proliferated blastic cells were positive for non-specific:__entity__ esterase:__entity__ , and the serum lysozyme level was elevated and diagnosed as monoblastic crisis .
The patient received combined chemotherapy but response was partial .
These findings are compatible with our previous report that nm23:__entity__ gene:__entity__ is overexpressed in monocytic leukemia .
Increased transcription decreases the spontaneous mutation rate at the thymidine:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ locus:__entity__ in human cells .
Transcription increases DNA repair efficiency and modulates the distribution of certain types of DNA damage .
Furthermore , increased transcription level stimulates spontaneous mutation rate in yeast .
We explored whether transcription level affects spontaneous mutation rate in human cells .
We first developed two thymidine kinase ( tk ) inducible human cell lines using the Gal4-Estrogen receptor system .
In our TK6i-G3 and G9 tk heterozygous cell lines , the active tk:__entity__ allele:__entity__ is linked to an inducible promoter:__entity__ element:__entity__ .
Tk:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ is induced following treatment with estrogen .
Spontaneous mutation rate was significantly decreased in human cell lines after induction in contrast to the report in yeast .
Thus , humans may have evolved different or additional mechanisms to deal with transcription related spontaneous mutagenesis .

Mutation of BCL-6:__entity__ gene:__entity__ in normal B cells by the process of somatic hypermutation of Ig:__entity__ genes:__entity__ .
Immunoglobulin:__entity__ (:__entity__ Ig:__entity__ ):__entity__ genes:__entity__ are hypermutated in B lymphocytes that are the precursors to memory B cells .
The mutations are linked to transcription initiation , but non-Ig:__entity__ promoters:__entity__ are permissible for the mutation process ; thus , other genes expressed in mutating B cells may also be subject to somatic hypermutation .
Significant mutations were not observed in c-MYC:__entity__ ,:__entity__ S14:__entity__ ,:__entity__ or:__entity__ alpha-fetoprotein:__entity__ (:__entity__ AFP:__entity__ ):__entity__ genes:__entity__ , but BCL-6:__entity__ was highly mutated in a large proportion of memory B cells of normal individuals .
The mutation pattern was similar to that of Ig:__entity__ genes:__entity__ .
CD28-mediated activation in CD45RA+ and CD45RO+ T cells : enhanced levels of reactive oxygen intermediates and c-Rel nuclear translocation in CD45RA+ cells .
We have analyzed the effect of complete T cell activation ( anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 ) on the activation of NF-kappaB:__entity__ in CD45RA+ ( naive ) and CD45RO+ ( memory/effector ) T cells .
Long exposure ( 24 h ) induced stronger NF-kappaB:__entity__ DNA binding in CD45RA+ cells than in CD45RO+ cells .
Analysis of the nuclear:__entity__ c-Rel:__entity__ protein:__entity__ indicated that after anti-CD3+anti-CD28 stimulation the level of c-Rel:__entity__ was higher in CD45RA+ cells .
Analysis of the cytoplasmic:__entity__ inhibitor:__entity__ IkappaBalpha:__entity__ indicated that anti-CD3+anti-CD28 stimulation induced a long-lasting degradation in CD45RA+ cells but in CD45RO+ cells the degradation process was more rapid .
Because the CD28:__entity__ costimulus is known to induce the production of reactive oxygen intermediates ( ROIs ) , the intracellular ROI levels in CD45RA+ and CD45RO+ cells were compared by flow cytometry .
ROIs were produced in both cell types , but more strongly in CD45RA+ cells .
The data presented in this study further emphasize the differences between CD45RA+ and CD45RO+ T lymphocytes in ROI-dependent signaling pathways .
Non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma involving bilateral breasts [ see comments ]
We describe here two cases of diffuse large cell type non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma affecting the bilateral breasts .
The contralateral tumor in one case appeared 17 months after the first mastectomy , whereas the bilateral tumors occurred concurrently in the other patient who was pregnant and showed widespread dissemination at initial presentation .
Lymphoma cells from both cases showed the mature B-cell immunophenotype and had rearrangements of the BCL6:__entity__ gene:__entity__ .
Both patients developed progressive disease despite chemo-radiotherapy and died of leukemic manifestations .
There were no apparent pathological features of lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue origin
Biochemical characterization of MIP-1:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ nuclear:__entity__ protein:__entity__ .
A family of hematopoietic:__entity__ specific:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ , MIP-1:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ nuclear:__entity__ protein:__entity__ (:__entity__ MNP:__entity__ ):__entity__ family:__entity__ , has recently been identified .
They are intimately involved in regulating the transcription of the huMIP-1:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ gene:__entity__ in monocytes , T-cells , and transformed B-cells .
One member of the family ( MNP-1:__entity__ ) is essential for promoter activity in monocytes and B-cells , while another ( MNP-2:__entity__ ) is required for full promotor activity in T-cells .
A third member of the family ( MNP-3:__entity__ ) is expressed in PMA induced HL60 cells and probably has a role in monocyte differentiation .
In this communication we demonstrate by two techniques that MNP-1:__entity__ and MNP-2:__entity__ are distinct but related factors , and we present further evidence to show that MNP-1:__entity__ acts as a heterodimer:__entity__ .
Bcl-3:__entity__ expression and nuclear translocation are induced by granulocyte-macrophage:__entity__ colony-stimulating:__entity__ factor:__entity__ and erythropoietin:__entity__ in proliferating human erythroid precursors .
Bcl-3:__entity__ is a proto-oncogene:__entity__ involved in the chromosomal translocation t:__entity__ (:__entity__ 14:__entity__ ;:__entity__ 19:__entity__ ):__entity__ found in some patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia .
It shares structural similarities with and is a member of the IkappaB:__entity__ family:__entity__ of proteins .
In this report , involvement of Bcl-3:__entity__ in hematopoietic growth factor-stimulated erythroid proliferation and differentiation was examined .
In TF-1 cells , an erythroleukemia cell line , granulocyte-macrophage:__entity__ colony-stimulating:__entity__ factor:__entity__ ( GM-CSF:__entity__ ) and erythropoietin:__entity__ ( Epo:__entity__ ) greatly enhanced Bcl-3:__entity__ expression at both the protein and mRNA levels in association with stimulation of proliferation .
Bcl-3:__entity__ protein was also highly expressed in early burst-forming unit-erythroid ( BFU-E ) -derived erythroid precursors ( day 7 ) and decreased during maturation ( days 10 and 14 ) , suggesting that Bcl-3:__entity__ is involved in normal erythroid proliferation .
In these hematopoietic cells , Bcl-3:__entity__ was hyperphosphorylated .
GM-CSF:__entity__ and Epo:__entity__ modulated the subcellular localization of Bcl-3:__entity__ .
Upon stimulation of TF-1 cells with GM-CSF:__entity__ or Epo:__entity__ , the nuclear translocation of Bcl-3:__entity__ was dramatically enhanced .
Overexpression of Bcl-3:__entity__ in TF-1 cells by transient transfection along with the NF-kappaB:__entity__ factors:__entity__ p50:__entity__ or:__entity__ p52:__entity__ resulted in significant induction of an human:__entity__ immunodeficiency:__entity__ virus-type:__entity__ 1:__entity__ (:__entity__ HIV-1:__entity__ ):__entity__ kappaB-TATA-luceriferase:__entity__ reporter:__entity__ plasmid:__entity__ , demonstrating that Bcl-3:__entity__ has a positive role in transactivation of kappaB-containing:__entity__ genes:__entity__ in erythroid cells .
Stimulation with GM-CSF:__entity__ enhanced c-myb:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ expression in these cells .
Bcl-3:__entity__ in nuclear extracts of TF-1 cells bound to a kappaB:__entity__ enhancer:__entity__ in the c-myb:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ together with NF-kappaB2/p52:__entity__ and this binding activity was enhanced by GM-CSF:__entity__ stimulation .
Furthermore , cotransfection of Bcl-3:__entity__ with p52:__entity__ or p50:__entity__ in TF-1 cells resulted in significant activation of a c-myb:__entity__ kappaB-TATA-luceriferase:__entity__ reporter:__entity__ plasmid:__entity__ .
These findings suggest that Bcl-3:__entity__ may participate in the transcriptional regulation of certain kappaB-containing:__entity__ genes:__entity__ involved in hematopoiesis , including c-myb:__entity__ .

5-Lipoxygenase:__entity__ compartmentalization in granulocytic cells is modulated by an internal:__entity__ bipartite:__entity__ nuclear:__entity__ localizing:__entity__ sequence:__entity__ and nuclear:__entity__ factor:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ complex:__entity__ formation .
A region of basic amino acids spanning residues:__entity__ 639-656:__entity__ in the human:__entity__ 5-lipoxygenase:__entity__ sequence:__entity__ resembles a consensus:__entity__ bipartite:__entity__ nuclear:__entity__ localizing:__entity__ sequence:__entity__ .
A synthetic peptide consisting of the Kaposi:__entity__ fibroblast:__entity__ growth:__entity__ factor:__entity__ signal:__entity__ sequence:__entity__ fused to the 5-lipoxygenase639-656:__entity__ bipartite:__entity__ nuclear:__entity__ localizing:__entity__ sequence:__entity__ has a prominent inhibitory effect on 5-lipoxygenase:__entity__ catalysis in granulocytic HL-60 cells activated by calcium ionophor A23187 .
Recombinant 5-lipoxygenase:__entity__ was not affected by the peptide .
The peptide also inhibited redistribution of 5-lipoxygenase:__entity__ from the cytosol to the nuclear membrane of HL-60 cells stimulated by A23187 .
5-Lipoxygenase:__entity__ protein:__entity__ was detected in nuclear:__entity__ factor:__entity__ kappaB:__entity__ (:__entity__ NF-kappaB:__entity__ ):__entity__ p65:__entity__ subunit:__entity__ immunoprecipitate fractions prepared from HL-60 cell lysates .
The amount of 5-lipoxygenase:__entity__ protein:__entity__ coimmunoprecipitated by NF-kappaB antiserum was increased following A23187 stimulation .
In cells treated with agents that block 5-lipoxygenase:__entity__ translocation to the nucleus , 5-lipoxygenase:__entity__ protein appearing in the NF-kappaB:__entity__ immunoprecipitate was diminished .
Our results implicate an internal:__entity__ bipartite:__entity__ nuclear:__entity__ localizing:__entity__ sequence:__entity__ as a regulatory domain that modulates 5-lipoxygenase:__entity__ redistribution and catalysis in granulocytic cells .
Additionally , our results suggest that molecular determinants which govern 5-lipoxygenase and NF-kappaB redistribution to the nucleus may be coordinately controlled in granulocytic cells .

Inhibition of CD28/CD3-mediated costimulation of naive and memory human T lymphocytes by intracellular incorporation of polyclonal:__entity__ antibodies:__entity__ specific for the activator:__entity__ protein-1:__entity__ transcriptional:__entity__ complex:__entity__ .
A number of indirect methods have been utilized in demonstrating activator:__entity__ protein-1:__entity__ transcription factor function in IL-2 promoter activity .
However , there has been no direct demonstration that activator:__entity__ protein-1:__entity__ is involved in CD28-dependent costimulation of IL-2:__entity__ gene:__entity__ transcription in freshly isolated naive and memory human T lymphocytes .
To address this issue , the method of scrape loading was applied to purified peripheral blood T lymphocytes .
Since scrape loading relies on adherent cells , peripheral blood human T ( PB-T ) cells were immobilized on the nonspecific cell attachment factor poly-L-lysine .
Cells scraped off poly-L-lysine in the presence of Ig:__entity__ FITC:__entity__ efficiently incorporated Ig , with relatively uniform fluorescence .
T cells retained their physical parameters as measured by forward and side light scatter , and functional activity as measured by costimulation of proliferation and IL-2:__entity__ production after being scraped off this substrate .
CD28/CD3-costimulated T cells produced intracellular IL-2:__entity__ from all subsets measured ( CD4+ , CD4- , CD45RO+ , and CD45RO- ) .
IL-2:__entity__ production and intracellular accumulation in nonscraped PB-T cells activated with CD28/CD3 coligation were skewed favoring CD45RO+ and CD4+ subsets , as was IL-2:__entity__ production in scraped PB-T cells .
The intracellular incorporation of Abs specific for c-Fos:__entity__ and:__entity__ c-Jun:__entity__ family:__entity__ members:__entity__ by scrape loading inhibited the production and intracellular accumulation of IL-2:__entity__ within 6 h of costimulation with PMA/ionomycin , or costimulation by CD28 and CD3 ligation .
Scrape loading thus provides an efficient mechanism for intracellular incorporation of macromolecules , and the first direct evidence that c-Fos:__entity__ and c-Jun:__entity__ are involved in transcription of the IL-2:__entity__ gene:__entity__ within its correct chromosomal context , in resting human T lymphocyte subpopulations .
Differential expression of Nur77:__entity__ family:__entity__ members:__entity__ in human T-lymphotropic virus type 1-infected cells : transactivation of the TR3/nur77:__entity__ gene:__entity__ by Tax:__entity__ protein:__entity__ .
We analyzed the differential expression and regulation of three members of the Nur77:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ family:__entity__ by the human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) Tax:__entity__ protein:__entity__ .
We have demonstrated that in both HTLV-1-infected cells and Tax-expressing JPX-9 cells , TR3/nur77:__entity__ is highly expressed , whereas neither NOR-1 nor NOT expression is detectable .
Transient transfection analysis further confirmed the Tax:__entity__ transactivation of the TR3/nur77:__entity__ promoter but not the NOR-1:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ in different cell types .
Furthermore , expression of a luciferase:__entity__ reporter:__entity__ gene:__entity__ driven by the NGFI-B:__entity__ (:__entity__ rat:__entity__ homolog:__entity__ of:__entity__ TR3/Nur77:__entity__ ):__entity__ response:__entity__ element:__entity__ ( NBRE:__entity__ ) provided evidence that Tax:__entity__ -mediated transactivation resulted in the induction of a functional protein .
Cotransfection assays with the TR3/nur77:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ sequence:__entity__ or the NBRE:__entity__ binding motif together with a series of Tax:__entity__ mutants have shown that Tax:__entity__ -induced TR3/nur77:__entity__ expression is mediated by CREB/ATF-related:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ .
Negative regulation of the heat shock transcriptional response by HSBP1:__entity__ .
In response to stress , heat:__entity__ shock:__entity__ factor:__entity__ 1:__entity__ ( HSF1:__entity__ ) acquires rapid DNA binding and transient transcriptional activity while undergoing conformational transition from an inert non-DNA-binding:__entity__ monomer:__entity__ to active functional trimers .
Attenuation of the inducible transcriptional response occurs during heat shock or upon recovery at non-stress conditions and involves dissociation of the HSF1:__entity__ trimer:__entity__ and loss of activity .
We have used the hydrophobic:__entity__ repeats:__entity__ of the HSF1:__entity__ trimerization domain in the yeast two-hybrid protein interaction assay to identify heat:__entity__ shock:__entity__ factor:__entity__ binding:__entity__ protein:__entity__ 1:__entity__ ( HSBP1:__entity__ ) , a novel , conserved , 76-amino-acid:__entity__ protein:__entity__ that contains two extended arrays of hydrophobic:__entity__ repeats:__entity__ that interact with the HSF1:__entity__ heptad:__entity__ repeats:__entity__ .
HSBP1:__entity__ is nuclear-localized and interacts in vivo with the active trimeric state of HSF1:__entity__ that appears during heat shock .
During attenuation of HSF1:__entity__ to the inert monomer , HSBP1:__entity__ associates with Hsp70 .
HSBP1:__entity__ negatively affects HSF1:__entity__ DNA-binding activity , and overexpression of HSBP1:__entity__ in mammalian cells represses the transactivation activity of HSF1:__entity__ .
To establish a biological role for HSBP1:__entity__ , the homologous Caenorhabditis:__entity__ elegans:__entity__ protein:__entity__ was overexpressed in body wall muscle cells and was shown to block activation of the heat shock response from a heat:__entity__ shock:__entity__ promoter-reporter:__entity__ construct:__entity__ .
Alteration in the level of HSBP1:__entity__ expression in C. elegans has severe effects on survival of the animals after thermal and chemical stress , consistent with a role for HSBP1:__entity__ as a negative regulator of the heat shock response .
Long-range transcriptional regulation of cytokine gene expression .
Most studies on the control of cytokine gene expression have involved the functional analysis of proximal:__entity__ promoters:__entity__ .
Recent work has identified distal:__entity__ elements:__entity__ that mediate long-range cytokine gene regulation and has implicated chromatin reorganization in regulation of cytokine:__entity__ gene:__entity__ loci:__entity__ .
These studies have begun to elucidate the basis for cell-specificity and high-level expression of cytokine:__entity__ genes:__entity__ .
A signaling complex of Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent:__entity__ protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ IV:__entity__ and protein:__entity__ phosphatase:__entity__ 2A:__entity__ [ see comments ]
Stimulation of T lymphocytes results in a rapid increase in intracellular calcium concentration ( [ Ca2+ ] i ) that parallels the activation of Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent:__entity__ protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ IV:__entity__ ( CaMKIV:__entity__ ) , a nuclear:__entity__ enzyme:__entity__ that can phosphorylate and activate the cyclic:__entity__ adenosine:__entity__ monophosphate:__entity__ (:__entity__ cAMP:__entity__ ):__entity__ response:__entity__ element-binding:__entity__ protein:__entity__ ( CREB:__entity__ ) .
However , inactivation of CaMKIV:__entity__ occurs despite the sustained increase in [ Ca2+ ] i that is required for T cell activation .
A stable and stoichiometric complex of CaMKIV:__entity__ with protein:__entity__ serine-threonine:__entity__ phosphatase:__entity__ 2A:__entity__ ( PP2A:__entity__ ) was identified in which PP2A:__entity__ dephosphorylates CaMKIV:__entity__ and functions as a negative regulator of CaMKIV:__entity__ signaling .
In Jurkat T cells , inhibition of PP2A:__entity__ activity by small t antigen enhanced activation of CREB:__entity__ -mediated transcription by CaMKIV:__entity__ .
These findings reveal an intracellular signaling mechanism whereby a protein:__entity__ serine-threonine:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ ( CaMKIV:__entity__ ) is regulated by a tightly associated protein:__entity__ serine-threonine:__entity__ phosphatase:__entity__ ( PP2A:__entity__ ) .
Hypoxia down-regulates MCP-1:__entity__ expression : implications for macrophage distribution in tumors .
Monocyte:__entity__ chemoattractant:__entity__ protein:__entity__ 1:__entity__ ( MCP-1:__entity__ ) is likely to contribute to the macrophage infiltrate in human ovarian carcinomas .
Although MCP-1:__entity__ is predominantly expressed by the tumor parenchyma , macrophages accumulate at highest density in necrotic regions , which are associated with low oxygen tensions .
Tumor:__entity__ necrosis:__entity__ factor:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ ( TNF-alpha:__entity__ ) can stimulate MCP-1:__entity__ production and is also present within ovarian carcinomas .
We have investigated the effect of hypoxia both on MCP-1:__entity__ expression in ovarian cancer cell lines and monocyte migration .
Hypoxia down-regulated TNF-alpha-induced:__entity__ MCP-1:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ and protein production by ovarian cancer cells .
The effect was mimicked by cobalt chloride and desferrioxamine , consistent with a specific oxygen-sensing mechanism .
Unlike antioxidants , hypoxia did not inhibit nuclear factor KB mobilization .
Monocyte migration in response to MCP-1:__entity__ was also diminished under hypoxic conditions .
Down-regulation of MCP-1:__entity__ expression and the inhibition of monocyte migration are independent effects of hypoxia that may contribute to the distribution of macrophages within ovarian tumors .
Activation of nuclear:__entity__ factor:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ inflammatory bowel disease [ see comments ]
BACKGROUND : Expression of pro-inflammatory:__entity__ cytokines:__entity__ is increased in the intestinal lamina propria of patients with inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) .
Nuclear:__entity__ factor:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ ( NF:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ ) controls transcription of inflammation:__entity__ genes:__entity__ .
On activation , NF:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ is rapidly released from its cytoplasmic:__entity__ inhibitor:__entity__ ( I:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ ) , transmigrates into the nucleus , and binds to DNA:__entity__ response:__entity__ elements:__entity__ in gene promoter regions .
AIMS : To investigate whether increased activation of NF:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ is important in IBD and may be down-regulated by anti-inflammatory treatment .
METHODS : Activation of NF:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ was determined by western blot assessment and electrophoretic mobility shift assay in nuclear extracts of colonic biopsy samples as well as lamina propria mononuclear cells .
RESULTS : Nuclear levels of NF:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ p65:__entity__ are increased in lamina propria biopsy specimens from patients with Crohn 's disease in comparison with patients with ulcerative colitis and controls .
Increased activation of NF:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ was detected in lamina propria mononuclear cells from patients with active IBD .
Corticosteroids strongly inhibit intestinal NF:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ activation in IBD in vivo and in vitro by stabilising the cytosolic:__entity__ inhibitor:__entity__ I:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ alpha against activation induced degradation .
CONCLUSIONS : In both IBDs , but particularly Crohn 's disease , increased activation of NF:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ may be involved in the regulation of the inflammatory response .
Inhibition of NF:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ activation may represent a mechanism by which steroids exert an anti-inflammatory effect in IBD
Insufficient glycemic control increases nuclear:__entity__ factor-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ binding activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from patients with type 1 diabetes .
OBJECTIVE : The redox-sensitive:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ nuclear:__entity__ factor-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ ( NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ ) is believed to contribute to late diabetic complications .
It is unknown whether NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ is influenced by glycemic control .
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : To determine whether NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ is activated in patients with insufficient glycemic control ( HbA1c > 10 % ) , we developed a tissue culture-independent electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) -based semiquantitative detection system that allowed us to determine NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ activation in ex vivo-isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) .
We included 43 patients with type 1 diabetes in this cross-sectional study .
10 of those received the antioxidant thioctic acid ( 600 mg/day p.o. ) for 2 weeks .
RESULTS : Monocytes of patients with HbA1c levels > 10 % demonstrated significantly higher NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ binding activity in an EMSA and a stronger NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ staining in immunohistochemistry than monocytes of patients with HbA1c levels of 6-8 % .
The increase in NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ activation correlated with an increase in plasmatic markers of lipid peroxidation .
Treatment with the antioxidant thioctic acid decreased NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ binding activity .
CONCLUSIONS : Hyperglycemia induces activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ in ex vivo-isolated PBMCs of patients with type 1 diabetes .
NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ activation is at least partially dependent on oxidative stress , since the antioxidant thioctic acid significantly lowered the extent of NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ binding activity .
Synergistic activation of MAP:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ ( ERK1/2:__entity__ ) by erythropoietin:__entity__ and stem:__entity__ cell:__entity__ factor:__entity__ is essential for expanded erythropoiesis .
Stem:__entity__ cell:__entity__ factor:__entity__ ( SCF:__entity__ ) and erythropoietin:__entity__ ( EPO:__entity__ ) work synergistically to support erythropoiesis , but the mechanism for this synergism is unknown .
By using purified human erythroid colony-forming cells ( ECFC ) , we have found that SCF:__entity__ and EPO:__entity__ synergistically activate MAP:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ ( MAPK:__entity__ , ERK1/2:__entity__ ) , which correlates with the cell growth and thus may be responsible for the synergistic effects .
Treatment of the cells with PD98059 and wortmannin , inhibitors of MEK:__entity__ and PI-3:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ , respectively , inhibited the synergistic activation of MAPK:__entity__ and also the cell growth , further supporting this conclusion .
Wortmannin only inhibits MAPK:__entity__ activation induced by EPO:__entity__ but not that by SCF:__entity__ , suggesting that SCF:__entity__ and EPO:__entity__ may activate MAPK:__entity__ through different pathways , which would facilitate synergy .
Furthermore , EPO:__entity__ , but not SCF:__entity__ , led to activation of STAT5:__entity__ , whereas SCF:__entity__ and wortmannin had no effect on the EPO:__entity__ -induced STAT5:__entity__ activation , suggesting that STAT5:__entity__ is not involved in the synergistic action of SCF:__entity__ and EPO:__entity__ .
Together , the data suggest that synergistic activation of MAPK:__entity__ by SCF:__entity__ and EPO:__entity__ is essential for expanded erythropoiesis .

The molecular and phenotypic profile of primary central nervous system lymphoma identifies distinct categories of the disease and is consistent with histogenetic derivation from germinal center-related B cells .
Primary central nervous system lymphoma ( PCNSL ) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -infected individuals .
The precise histogenetic derivation and the molecular pathogenesis of PCNSL is poorly understood .
In an attempt to clarify the histogenesis and pathogenesis of these lymphomas , 49 PCNSL ( 26 acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [ AIDS ] -related and 23 AIDS-unrelated ) were analyzed for multiple biologic markers , which are known to bear histogenetic and pathogenetic significance for mature B-cell neoplasms .
PCNSL associated frequently ( 50.0 % ) with mutations of BCL-6:__entity__ 5:__entity__ ':__entity__ noncoding:__entity__ regions:__entity__ , which are regarded as a marker of B-cell transition through the germinal center ( GC ) .
Expression of BCL-6:__entity__ protein:__entity__ , which is restricted to GC B cells throughout physiologic B-cell maturation , was detected in 100 % AIDS-unrelated PCNSL and in 56.2 % AIDS-related cases .
Notably , among AIDS-related PCNSL , expression of BCL-6:__entity__ was mutually exclusive with expression of Epstein-Barr:__entity__ virus:__entity__ (:__entity__ EBV:__entity__ ):__entity__ -encoded:__entity__ latent:__entity__ membrane:__entity__ protein:__entity__ (:__entity__ LMP:__entity__ ):__entity__ -1:__entity__ and , with few exceptions , also of BCL-2:__entity__ .
All but one PCNSL expressed hMSH2 , which among mature B cells selectively stains GC B cells .
These data suggest that PCNSL may be frequently related to GC B cells and may be segregated into two major biologic categories based on the expression pattern of BCL-6:__entity__ , LMP-1:__entity__ , and BCL-2:__entity__ .
BCL-6:__entity__ ( + ) / LMP-1:__entity__ ( - ) / BCL-2:__entity__ ( - ) PCNSL occur both in the presence and in the absence of HIV infection and consistently display a large noncleaved cell morphology .
Conversely , BCL-6:__entity__ ( - ) / LMP-1:__entity__ ( + ) / BCL-2:__entity__ ( + ) PCNSL are restricted to HIV-infected hosts and are represented by lymphomas with immunoblastic features .
These data are relevant for the pathogenesis and histogenesis of PCNSL and may be helpful to segregate distinct biologic and prognostic categories of these lymphomas .

Antioxidant regulation of phorbol ester-induced adhesion of human Jurkat T-cells to endothelial cells .
Regulation of adhesion molecule expression and function by reactive oxygen species via specific redox sensitive mechanisms have been reported .
The effects of clinically safe antioxidants in the regulation of adhesion molecule expression in human endothelial cells ( ECV ) , and adherence of human Jurkat T cells to ECV cells were investigated .
The thiol antioxidant , alpha-lipoate , at clinically relevant doses down-regulated phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) -induced adhesion molecule expression and cell-cell adhesion .
Inhibition of PMA-induced ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression as well as PMA-induced adhesion of Jurkat T-cells to ECV cells by alpha-lipoate was dose dependent ( 50-250 microM ) .
The effect was significant for ICAM-1:__entity__ ( p < .01 ) and VCAM-1:__entity__ ( p < .01 ) expression in cells pretreated with 100 microM alpha-lipoate compared to PMA-activated untreated cells .
Inhibition of PMA-induced adhesion molecule expression and cell-cell adhesion was more pronounced when a combination of antioxidants , alpha-lipoate and alpha-tocopherol , were used compared to the use of either of these antioxidant alone .
The regulation of adhesion molecule expression and function by low concentration of antioxidants investigated does not appear to be NF-kappaB:__entity__ regulated or transcription dependent because no change in the mRNA response was observed .
Protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ C:__entity__ ( PKC:__entity__ ) has been suggested to regulate PMA-induced adhesion molecule expression by post-transcriptional stabilization of adhesion:__entity__ molecule:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ .
Alpha-lipoate pretreatment did not influence the response of PKC:__entity__ activity to PMA .
Oxidants are known to be involved in the regulation of cell adhesion processes .
Treatment of ECV cells with PMA induced generation of intracellular oxidants .
Alpha-lipoate ( 100 or 250 microM ) treatment decreased PMA-induced generation of intracellular oxidants .
The inhibitory effect of low concentration of alpha-lipaote alone or in combination with alpha-tocopherol on agonist-induced adhesion processes observed in this study may be of potential therapeutic value .
Binding of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 to CD4:__entity__ and:__entity__ CXCR4:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ differentially regulates expression of inflammatory:__entity__ genes:__entity__ and activates the MEK:__entity__ /ERK signaling pathway .
We have previously shown that binding of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) virions to CD4:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ stimulates association of Lck:__entity__ with Raf-1:__entity__ and results in the activation of Raf-1:__entity__ kinase in a Ras-independent manner .
In the present study , we demonstrate that HIV-1:__entity__ envelope:__entity__ glycoproteins:__entity__ of both T-cell-tropic and macrophagetropic strains rapidly activate the ERK/mitogen-activated protein ( MAP ) kinase pathway and the binding of nuclear:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ ( AP-1:__entity__ , NF-kappaB:__entity__ , and C/EBP:__entity__ ) and stimulate expression of cytokine:__entity__ and:__entity__ chemokine:__entity__ genes:__entity__ .
The activation of this signaling pathway requires functional CD4:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ and is independent of binding to CXCR4:__entity__ .
Binding of the natural ligand stromal:__entity__ cell-derived:__entity__ factor:__entity__ 1:__entity__ ( SDF-1:__entity__ ) to CXCR4:__entity__ , which inhibits entry of T-cell-tropic HIV-1 , activates also the ERK/ MAP:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ pathway .
However , SDF-1:__entity__ did not affect the CD4-mediated expression of cytokine:__entity__ and:__entity__ chemokine:__entity__ genes:__entity__ .
These results provide firm molecular evidence that binding of HIV-1:__entity__ envelope:__entity__ glycoproteins:__entity__ to CD4:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ initiates a signaling pathway ( s ) independent of the binding to the chemokine:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ that leads to the aberrant expression of inflammatory:__entity__ genes:__entity__ and may contribute significantly to HIV-1 replication as well as to deregulation of the immune system .
Antigen receptor signaling induces MAP kinase-mediated phosphorylation and degradation of the BCL-6:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ .
The bcl-6:__entity__ proto-oncogene:__entity__ encodes a POZ/zinc:__entity__ finger:__entity__ transcriptional:__entity__ repressor:__entity__ expressed in germinal center ( GC ) B and T cells and required for GC formation and antibody affinity maturation .
Deregulation of bcl-6:__entity__ expression by chromosomal rearrangements and point mutations of the bcl-6:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ region:__entity__ are implicated in the pathogenesis of B-cell lymphoma .
The signals regulating bcl-6:__entity__ expression are not known .
Here we show that antigen receptor activation leads to BCL-6:__entity__ phosphorylation by mitogen-activated:__entity__ protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ ( MAPK:__entity__ ) .
Phosphorylation , in turn , targets BCL-6:__entity__ for rapid degradation by the ubiquitin:__entity__ / proteasome:__entity__ pathway .
These findings indicate that BCL-6:__entity__ expression is directly controlled by the antigen receptor via MAPK:__entity__ activation .
This signaling pathway may be crucial for the control of B-cell differentiation and antibody response and has implications for the regulation of other POZ/zinc:__entity__ finger:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ in other tissues .
Glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ are differentially expressed in the cells and tissues of the immune system .
Cytosolic:__entity__ glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ ( GR:__entity__ ) binding studies on immune tissues demonstrate that the thymus exhibits three to four times higher levels of GR:__entity__ protein:__entity__ than the spleen .
High levels of GR:__entity__ are consistent with the exquisite sensitivity of the thymus to glucocorticoid exposure .
Nevertheless , whole cell binding studies reveal similar levels of GR:__entity__ in immature thymic T lymphocytes and more mature , splenic T lymphocytes .
Moreover , whole cell binding techniques indicate that neutrophils ( which represent roughly 30 % of splenic leukocytes ) exhibit higher GR:__entity__ than both T and B lymphocytes , further contradicting results from cytosolic binding studies .
To address these inconsistencies , GR:__entity__ protein:__entity__ was assessed in immune cells and tissues using cytosolic radioligand binding .
Western blot analysis , and immunocytochemistry .
Consistent with previous cytosolic receptor binding studies on immune tissue homogenates , thymic T cells were found to have higher levels of GR:__entity__ than T cells isolated from the spleen .
In addition , neutrophils were found to have fewer GR:__entity__ than lymphocytes and monocytes .
These results indicate a meaningful relationship between receptor expression and known sensitivity to glucocorticoids .
Functional replacement of the mouse:__entity__ E2A:__entity__ gene:__entity__ with a human:__entity__ HEB:__entity__ cDNA:__entity__ .
The mammalian:__entity__ E2A:__entity__ ,:__entity__ HEB:__entity__ ,:__entity__ and:__entity__ E2-2:__entity__ genes:__entity__ encode a unique class of basic:__entity__ helix-loop-helix:__entity__ (:__entity__ bHLH:__entity__ ):__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ that are evolutionarily conserved and essential for embryonic and postnatal development .
While the structural and functional similarities among the gene:__entity__ products:__entity__ are well demonstrated , it is not clear why deletion of E2A:__entity__ , but not HEB:__entity__ or E2-2:__entity__ , leads to a complete arrest in B-lymphocyte development .
To understand the molecular basis of the functional specificity between E2A:__entity__ and HEB:__entity__ / E2-2:__entity__ in mammalian development , we generated and tested a panel of E2A:__entity__ knockin mutations including subtle mutations in the E12:__entity__ and:__entity__ E47:__entity__ exons:__entity__ and substitution of both E12:__entity__ and:__entity__ E47:__entity__ exons:__entity__ with a human:__entity__ HEB:__entity__ cDNA:__entity__ .
We find that the alternatively spliced E12:__entity__ and:__entity__ E47:__entity__ bHLH:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ of the E2A:__entity__ gene:__entity__ play similar and additive roles in supporting B lymphopoiesis .
Further , we find that HEB:__entity__ driven by the endogenous:__entity__ E2A:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ can functionally replace E2A:__entity__ in supporting B-cell commitment and differentiation toward completion .
Finally , the postnatal lethality associated with E2A:__entity__ disruption is fully rescued by the addition of HEB:__entity__ .
This study suggests that the functional divergence among E12:__entity__ , E47:__entity__ , and HEB:__entity__ in different cell types is partially defined by the context of gene expression .
Biased dependency of CD80:__entity__ versus CD86:__entity__ in the induction of transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ regulating the human:__entity__ IL-2:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ .
In addition to the signals obtained by ligation of the TCR , T cells need additional , co-stimulatory signals to be activated .
One such co-stimulatory signal is delivered when CD28:__entity__ on T cells binds to CD80:__entity__ or CD86:__entity__ on antigen-presenting cells ( APC ) .
In the present study , we analyzed the ability of CD80:__entity__ and CD86:__entity__ to co-stimulate human T cells activated by superantigen .
Using the Raji B cell lymphoma , which express similar levels of CD80:__entity__ and CD86:__entity__ , it was found that T cell proliferation was mainly co-stimulated by CD80:__entity__ .
To further characterize the consequences of this biased co-stimulatory dependency , we employed a well-defined system of transfected CHO cells expressing human:__entity__ MHC:__entity__ class:__entity__ II:__entity__ together with CD80:__entity__ , CD86:__entity__ or CD80:__entity__ and CD86:__entity__ .
Proliferation of freshly prepared CD4+ T cells required the presence of either CD80:__entity__ or CD86:__entity__ .
However , IL-2:__entity__ production reached only suboptimal levels in the presence of CD86:__entity__ but optimal levels with CD80:__entity__ .
To analyze IL-2:__entity__ transcriptional activity in CD80:__entity__ and CD86:__entity__ co-stimulated T cells we used Jurkat T cells transfected with luciferase:__entity__ reporter:__entity__ gene:__entity__ constructs:__entity__ .
CD80:__entity__ induced higher levels of IL-2:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ -enhancer activity compared to CD86:__entity__ .
Furthermore , the activity of transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ regulating the IL-2:__entity__ promoter-enhancer:__entity__ region:__entity__ including activation:__entity__ protein-1:__entity__ , CD28:__entity__ response:__entity__ element:__entity__ and nuclear:__entity__ factor:__entity__ kappaB:__entity__ were 4-8 times higher after CD80:__entity__ compared to CD86:__entity__ ligation .
Our results suggest that the eventual appearance of CD80:__entity__ on recently activated CD86+ APC is important for the superinduction of IL-2:__entity__ production and to support vigorous T cell proliferation .
Duplication of the DR3:__entity__ gene:__entity__ on human:__entity__ chromosome:__entity__ 1p36:__entity__ and its deletion in human neuroblastoma .
The human:__entity__ DR3:__entity__ gene:__entity__ , whose product is also known as Wsl-1/APO-3/TRAMP/LARD:__entity__ , encodes a tumor:__entity__ necrosis:__entity__ factor-related:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ that is expressed primarily on the surface of thymocytes and lymphocytes .
DR3:__entity__ is capable of inducing both NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ activation and apoptosis when overexpressed in mammalian cells , although its ligand has not yet been identified .
We report here that the DR3:__entity__ gene:__entity__ locus:__entity__ is tandemly duplicated on human:__entity__ chromosome:__entity__ band:__entity__ 1p36.2-p36.3:__entity__ and that these genes are hemizygously deleted and/or translocated to another chromosome in neuroblastoma ( NB ) cell lines with amplified MYCN .
Duplication of at least a portion of the DR3:__entity__ gene:__entity__ , including the extracellular:__entity__ and:__entity__ transmembrane:__entity__ regions:__entity__ but not the cytoplasmic:__entity__ domain:__entity__ , was demonstrated by both fluorescence in situ hybridization and genomic Southern blotting .
In most NB cell lines , both the DR3:__entity__ and:__entity__ the:__entity__ DR3L:__entity__ sequences:__entity__ are simultaneously deleted and/or translocated to another chromosome:__entity__ .
Finally , DR3/:__entity__ Wsl-1:__entity__ protein:__entity__ expression is quite variable among these NB cell lines , with very low or undetectable levels in 7 of 17 NB cell lines
Differential protection of normal and malignant human myeloid progenitors ( CFU-GM ) from Ara-C toxicity using cycloheximide .
Cycloheximide , a reversible protein synthesis inhibitor , is thought to block DNA replication in normal cells by preventing synthesis of a labile:__entity__ protein:__entity__ .
In animal systems , cycloheximide protects normal cells from cytotoxic S-phase specific agents , such as cytosine arabinoside ( Ara-C ) .
Malignant cells appear not to be susceptible to cycloheximide-induced cycle arrest and , subsequently , may not be protected from Ara-C cytotoxicity .
The effect of cycloheximide on granulocyte/macrophage progenitors ( CFU-GM ) after in vitro Ara-C exposure was examined using normal human bone marrow , malignant progenitors from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) , and clonogenic cells from the human acute nonlymphocytic leukemia cell lines HL-60 and KG-1 .
Mononuclear or clonogenic cells were incubated for one hour with cycloheximide , followed by the addition , for three or 17 hours , of Ara-C before being plated in a methylcellulose culture system .
CFU-GM survival was significantly increase if normal cells were treated with cycloheximide before Ara-C exposure .
Similar cycloheximide pretreatment of CML progenitors and clonogenic HL-60 and KG-1 cells failed to protect CFU-GM from Ara-C-induced cytotoxicity .
Primary cortisol resistance accompanied by a reduction in glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ in two members of the same family .
This report describes studies of a man suspected of having primary cortisol resistance .
This conclusion is based on his high plasma cortisol levels and high 24-h urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroid and cortisol excretion , plus the fact that he had no manifestations of Cushing 's syndrome .
Among family members tested , his mother also had hypercortisolemia .
Both mother and son had high levels of unbound plasma cortisol , but their plasma ACTH concentrations were within the normal range .
Both were partially resistant to dexamethasone adrenal suppression , and both had mild hypertension without hypokalemia .
To study this apparent end-organ resistance to cortisol , we examined the glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ in peripheral mononuclear cells .
Using whole cell assays , glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ in both patients were found to have reduced total binding capacity .
We conclude that these two patients , members of the same family , have primary cortisol resistance accompanied by a reduced number of glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ .
[ Glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ and response to polychemotherapy in acute lymphatic leukemia ]
Glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ ( GR:__entity__ ) levels were quantified in leukemic blasts from peripheral blood of 86 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia .
The subsequent achievement of complete remission after combination chemotherapy was correlated with high receptor levels .
Forty-seven of 50 patients with leukemic cells containing more than 6 , 000 receptor sites and 22 of 36 patients with cells containing less than 6 , 000 receptor sites achieved remission .
The study of glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ in leukemic cells may predict response to combination chemotherapy in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia .
Specific uptake of 1 , 25-dihydroxycholecalciferol by human chronic myeloid leukemia cells .
We have examined mononuclear cell preparations from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia [ CML ] for binding of and response to 1 , 25-dihydroxycholecalciferol [ 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 ] .
Whole cells specifically took up [ 3H ] -1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 with high affinity ( Kd 3.6 X 10 ( -11 ) M ) and low capacity .
Subcellular fractionation of labeled cells showed that binding was restricted to cytosols and nuclei .
Sucrose gradient centrifugation of cells preincubated with [ 3H ] -1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 revealed a single 3.6S peak which was totally displaced with 100-fold excess nonradioactive hormone .
However , we were unable to demonstrate specific binding of 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 by postlabeling standard cytosol preparations .
In addition , cytosols prepared from a mixture of CML cells and 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 receptor-positive T47D ( human breast cancer ) cells had less than 10 % of the binding measured in T47D cytosol alone .
However , the levels of binding in T47D cytosols were not reduced if the receptors were occupied with [ 3H ] -1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 prior to the addition of the CML cytosols .
Thus , CML cells appear to contain both the receptor for 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 and an unknown substance which prevents its detection following the preparation of cytosol .
Cells from patients with CML in the chronic phase specifically bound more 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 [ 18.0 +/- 3.2 ( S.E. ) fmol/10 ( 7 ) cells ] than did those in acute myeloid transformation [ 7.2 +/- 1.5 ] or than did cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia [ 2.6 +/- 0.8 ] .
Only cells from the first group of patients responded to the addition of 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 by differentiating along the monocyte-macrophage pathway .
We conclude that the differentiation-induction effect of 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 is likely to depend on adequate levels of receptor and that intact cells rather than cytosol preparations should be studied before cells of a particular tissue are designated as receptor negative .
Effect of cell cycle position on dexamethasone binding by mouse and human lymphoid cell lines : correlation between an increase in dexamethasone binding during S phase and dexamethasone sensitivity .
We determined the effect of cell cycle position on the amount of dexamethasone that was specifically bound by mouse and human lymphoid cell lines .
Cell lines that were either sensitive or resistant to growth inhibition by dexamethasone were compared .
Exponentially growing cells were separated by centrifugal elutriation into fractions that corresponded to different positions in the cell cycle .
The cell cycle phase distribution of each fraction was estimated by flow cytometry and autoradiography .
The amount of dexamethasone bound per cell in each fraction was measured by a whole cell binding assay .
In three dexamethasone-sensitive cell lines ( two mouse and one human ) , we found that the amount of dexamethasone bound per cell increased 2-4-fold between G1 phase and S phase , and then decreased during G2/M phase .
Results were the same when the amount of dexamethasone bound per milligram of cell:__entity__ protein:__entity__ was measured .
Binding affinity was the same during G1 phase and S phase , but the proportion of bound dexamethasone that translocated to the nucleus was greater during S phase .
In contrast , we found that the amount of dexamethasone bound per cell by three dexamethasone-resistant cell lines ( two mouse and one human ) did not increase during S phase .
Our results indicate that cell cycle changes in dexamethasone binding are not simply related to changes in cell:__entity__ protein:__entity__ or cell volume during the cell cycle .
An increase in dexamethasone binding during S phase may be required for dexamethasone to inhibit cell growth , and a failure of dexamethasone binding to increase during S phase might represent a new mechanism of dexamethasone resistance in lymphoid cells .
Presence and steroid inducibility of glutamine:__entity__ synthetase:__entity__ in human leukemic cells .
Glutamine:__entity__ synthetase:__entity__ ( EC 6.3.1.2 ; GS ) is present in lymphoblasts from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) as well as in normal peripheral blood lymphocytes .
In 16 out of 20 ALL patients studied exposure of the cells to physiological concentrations of dexamethasone in vitro increased enzyme:__entity__ activity above the control levels .
The increase was specific for glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ ligands .
A direct correlation was found between the magnitude of glucocorticoid-mediated increase of GS activity and the cellular levels of specific glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ assayed in the same cell specimen .
Moreover , the basal levels of the enzyme:__entity__ measured in cells prior to exposure to dexamethasone correlated negatively with receptor density .
It is suggested that the presence of steroid-inducible:__entity__ GS:__entity__ in ALL cells may prove to be a marker for functional:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ sites:__entity__ .
Binding of progestins to the glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ .
Correlation to their glucocorticoid-like effects on in vitro functions of human mononuclear leukocytes .
A number of physiological and synthetic progestins were tested for their ability to compete with [ 3H ] dexamethasone for the binding to the glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ of human mononuclear leukocytes and their ability to elicit glucocorticoid-like effects on the same cells .
As compared to the reference compound dexamethasone ( relative receptor binding affinity defined as 100 % ) , two potent synthetic progestins with a pregnane-type structure , megestrol acetate and medroxyprogesterone acetate , were found to display a considerable binding affinity towards the receptor ( 46 and 42 % , respectively ) .
The relative binding affinity of the naturally occurring ligand , cortisol , to the receptor was clearly lower ( 25 % ) .
The effective binding of medroxyprogesterone acetate to the glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ was confirmed by direct binding studies utilizing a tritiated derivative of this steroid .
No evidence for the existence of a specific progesterone:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ in human mononuclear leukocytes was obtained as judged by the results of competition experiments where a progesterone receptor-specific ligand [ 3H ] Org 2058 was used .
Medroxyprogesterone acetate and megestrol acetate also induced glucocorticoid-like effects on the lymphocyte functions .
These included inhibition of the proliferative responses to the T-cell:__entity__ mitogens:__entity__ concanavalin:__entity__ A:__entity__ and phytohaemagglutinin:__entity__ and an enhanced accumulation of immunoglobulin secreting cells in pokeweed mitogen-stimulated cultures .
The progestin effect appears to be mediated through a radiosensitive ( suppressor ) subpopulation of T lymphocytes .
In contrast , the synthetic progestins related structurally to 19-nortestosterone , norethisterone and d-norgestrel , were virtually devoid of binding affinity towards the glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ nor did they measurably influence the in vitro lymphocyte functions .
These studies demonstrate that certain progestins in common clinical use probably possess inherent glucocorticoid activity and suggest that side effects attributable to this character ( e.g. suppression of the pituitary-adrenal axis ) might be expected when these compounds are used in pharmacological doses .
Metabolic and ultrastructural aspects of the in vitro lysis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells by glucocorticoids .
Human chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) cells like prothymocytes and immunoactivated T-lymphocytes are readily lysed in vitro by pharmacological concentrations of glucocorticoids such as cortisol , whereas peripheral blood lymphocytes and thymocytes are unaffected by the hormone:__entity__ .
In this study , metabolic and ultrastructural aspects of the cortisol-induced killing process of CLL cells are recorded .
In vitro lysis was found to be temperature dependent and was detected only after 6 to 8 hr incubation with cortisol by means of the trypan blue exclusion test .
However , 30 min of incubation with cortisol at either 37 degrees or 4 degrees followed by the removal of the hormone:__entity__ was still sufficient to induce the lytic process .
Ultrastructural studies demonstrated sequential changes in the cytoplasm , including swelling of mitochondria and cytoplasmic decompartmentalization , followed by loss of surface microvilli with the appearance of `` holes '' in the cell membrane , and subsequent condensation of nuclear:__entity__ chromatin:__entity__ .
The large holes in the membrane appearing after 6 hr of incubation with the hormone:__entity__ may be the cause for the penetration of the viable stain into the dead cells , as seen by light microscopy .
Addition of metabolic inhibitors including actinomycin D , puromycin , and cycloheximide following administration of cortisol resulted in inhibition of the cell lysis .
An excess of an antagonist such as cortexolone was found to inhibit the cortisol-induced cytolysis of the CLL cells .
It is suggested that the glucocorticoid-induced lysis of human CLL cells is similar to the phenomenon observed in rat or murine lymphocytes and is mediated by interaction of the steroid molecule with the cytoplasmic:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ .
The resulting complex appears to activate specific gene:__entity__ ( s ) the products of which eventually cause cytolysis .
Glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ in lymphoid tumors .
There is a range of levels of glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ numbers seen in the various subclasses of acute lymphatic leukemia ( ALL ) .
This variability can not be explained by the known correlation between active cell proliferation and an increase in the number of receptors , since the tumors with the highest growth fraction ( i.e. , Burkitt 's lymphoma and T-cell leukemia ) tend to have lower average receptor numbers than do tumors with lower growth fractions such as common ALL .
All clinical specimens from patients with lymphatic leukemia have some measurable level of glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ ; therefore , the resistance seen in vivo can not be explained by the lack of receptors .
However , there has been a positive correlation , in our hands , with receptor level and prognosis .
On the basis of in vitro models , it is proposed that perhaps the high receptor cell lines ( i.e. , common ALL of childhood ) have relative stability of their genetic material making glucocorticoid-resistant mutations less likely to occur in patients with these cells than in low-receptor cell lines ( i.e. , T-cell leukemia ) .
This greater genetic variability in the low-receptor lines could account for the earlier emergence of clinical glucocorticoid resistance in these patients .
[ Tumor histology and steroid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ in breast carcinoma ]
In Specimens of 115 patients with breast cancer 4 tumorparameters ( tumorsize , tumorboder , nucleargrade , lymphocytic stromal reaction ) 3 features of regional lymphnodes ( sinushistiocytosis , T-cellreaction , lymphnode metastases ) and estrogen:__entity__ and:__entity__ progesteron:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ were determined .
A strong sinushistiocytosis and T-cellreaction could be verified mainly in metastases in free lymphnodes .
The steroid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ content does not correlate with histological parameters
Aldosterone-receptor:__entity__ deficiency in pseudohypoaldosteronism .
Pseudohypoaldosteronism , a syndrome characterized by salt wasting and failure to thrive , usually presents in infancy as high urinary levels of sodium despite hyponatremia , hyperkalemia , hyperreninemia , and elevated aldosterone levels .
We have investigated this syndrome for the possibility of abnormal:__entity__ Type:__entity__ I:__entity__ or ``:__entity__ mineralocorticoid-like:__entity__ '':__entity__ receptors:__entity__ , which have intrinsic steroid specificity indistinguishable from that of renal:__entity__ mineralocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ and are found in many tissues and cells , including mononuclear leukocytes .
We have studied three patients with pseudohypoaldosteronism : the 28-year-old index case in Melbourne ( Patient 1 ) and two siblings in Munich , eight and two years of age ( Patients 2 and 3 ) ; clinically , Patient 3 had a less severe case than his sister .
Percoll-separated control monocytes bound [ 3H ] aldosterone with high affinity ( Kd approximately 3 nM ) and limited capacity ( 150 to 600 sites per cell ) .
On repeated examination , no [ 3H ] aldosterone binding was found in monocytes from Patients 1 and 2 ; in Patient 3 , the levels were 62 sites per cell , more than 2 S.D. below those of the control .
Levels in the parents of the Munich patients ( first cousins ) were normal .
It appears that pseudohypoaldosteronism is caused by a Type I receptor defect , that the defect may be complete or partial , that transmission may be autosomal recessive , and that the study of patients with pseudohypoaldosteronism may indicate physiologic roles for Type:__entity__ I:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ in nonepithelial tissues .
Glucocorticoid inhibition of urokinase-like:__entity__ plasminogen:__entity__ activators:__entity__ in cultured human lymphoblasts .
Two human lymphoblast cell lines , LICR-LON-HMy2 ( HMy2 cells ) and GM4672A cells , are moderately growth inhibited by dexamethasone ( 1 , 4-pregnadien-9-fluoro-16 alpha-methyl-11 beta , 17 alpha , 21-triol-3 , 20-dione ) ( Dex ) .
Both cell types secrete a urokinase:__entity__ (:__entity__ UK:__entity__ ):__entity__ -like:__entity__ plasminogen:__entity__ activator:__entity__ ( PA:__entity__ ) .
Treatment of both HMy2 and GM4672A cells with Dex for 1-4 days inhibits extracellular PA:__entity__ activity in a concentration-dependent manner , being half-maximal at approximately 1 X 10 ( -9 ) M .
Inhibition of PA:__entity__ in both cell types is specific for active glucocorticoids , and this specificity parallels the ability of various steroids to bind to glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ .
HMy2 cell PA:__entity__ is fully suppressible by Dex , whereas up to one third of the activator expressed by GM4672A cells is resistant to glucocorticoid inhibition .
Mixing experiments using a UK standard and conditioned media from Dex-treated cells suggest an absence of glucocorticoid-inducible:__entity__ inhibitors:__entity__ to UK:__entity__ or plasmin:__entity__ in both cell types .
However , conditioned media from Dex-treated GM4672A cells inhibits a portion of the homologous cellular activator in conditioned media from control GM4672A cells .
Thus , low levels of glucocorticoid-inducible:__entity__ inhibitors:__entity__ may contribute to , but can not fully account for , Dex inhibition of GM4672A:__entity__ PA:__entity__ activity .
Glucocorticoid-inducible:__entity__ inhibitors:__entity__ in HMy2 cells are either totally absent or are present at undetectable levels .
Thus , regulation of UK-like:__entity__ PAs:__entity__ in HMy2 and GM4672A cells differs with respect to the extent to which glucocorticoids inhibit constitutively:__entity__ expressed:__entity__ activator:__entity__ levels , as well as the possible contribution of glucocorticoid-inducible:__entity__ inhibitors:__entity__ to the regulatory process in GM4672A cells .
Characterization of aldosterone binding sites in circulating human mononuclear leukocytes .
Aldosterone binding sites in human mononuclear leukocytes were characterized after separation of cells from blood by a Percoll gradient .
After washing and resuspension in RPMI-1640 medium , cells were incubated at 37 degrees C for 1 h with different concentrations of [ 3H ] aldosterone plus a 100-fold concentration of RU-26988 ( 11 alpha , 17 alpha-dihydroxy-17 beta-propynylandrost-1 , 4 , 6-trien-3-one ) , with or without an excess of unlabeled aldosterone .
Aldosterone binds to a single class of receptors with an affinity of 2.7 +/- 0.5 nM ( means +/- SD , n = 14 ) and a capacity of 290 +/- 108 sites/cell ( n = 14 ) .
The specificity data show a hierarchy of affinity of desoxycorticosterone = corticosterone = aldosterone greater than hydrocortisone greater than dexamethasone .
The results indicate that mononuclear leukocytes could be useful for studying the physiological significance of these mineralocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ and their regulation in humans .
Mineralocorticoid:__entity__ and:__entity__ glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ in circulating mononuclear leukocytes of patients with primary hyperaldosteronism .
Mineralocorticoid:__entity__ and:__entity__ glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ were measured in circulating mononuclear leukocytes in 5 patients affected by Conn 's syndrome ( 3 cases of bilateral adrenal hyperplasia and 2 cases of adenoma plus unilateral hyperplasia ) .
The number of the binding sites per cell resulted significantly lower ( 189 +/- 114 , mean +/- SD ) , as compared with the normal controls ( 298 +/- 105 ) .
The affinity of aldosterone for the receptor was found to be not different than that of healthy control subjects .
The capacity and the affinity of dexamethasone for glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ ranged in the normal values .
These data suggest a possible down-regulation of mineralocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ in humans .
Short-term and long-term effects of estrogen on lymphoid tissues and lymphoid cells with some remarks on the significance for carcinogenesis .
Estrogens have long been thought to play a role in regulating the immune system .
The difference in some types of immune responses between males and females is well-known , as is the pronounced thymic involution induced by exogenous estrogens .
Estrogens stimulate some aspects of macrophage activity and , depending on dose and mitogen:__entity__ , inhibit or stimulate lymphocyte proliferative response in vitro .
Another example is the estrogen effect on the delayed type hypersensitivity response .
A broad review is given of such estrogen effects on lymphoid tissue and immune response .
Most of the studies published so far are phenomenological .
However , the recent description of estrogen:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ in the thymus and in some lymphocyte subpopulations , as well as a deeper understanding of regulating factors in the immune system , open the possibility of a more detailed understanding of the estrogen mechanism of interference .
Estrogen effects in adults are reversible .
After treating neonatal mice with the synthetic estrogen diethylstilbestrol ( DES ) , disturbances are induced in lymphocyte populations and lymphocyte functions which are permanent and irreversible .
Lymphocytes from adult , neonatally DES-treated female mice have a reduced mitogen response to ConA:__entity__ and LPS:__entity__ ( T:__entity__ and:__entity__ B:__entity__ cell:__entity__ mitogen:__entity__ ) and the delayed type hypersensitivity response is depressed .
A detailed analysis demonstrated a decreased T helper cell population .
The activity of Natural Killer cells is permanently reduced and this functional impairment is related to a decreased number of these cells , in turn determined at the bone marrow level .
The same animals have an increased sensitivity to chemical carcinogens ( methylcholanthrene ) and they spontaneously develop epithelial changes in the uterine cervix which morphologically are similar to adenocarcinoma .
The association between estrogen-associated malignancy and estrogen effects in lymphocyte functions deserves further study .
Drugs affecting the hormonal receptors of normal and leukaemic peripheral leucocytes .
The authors investigated the behaviour of steroid hormone uptake in leukaemic cells ( CML , CLL , AML , ALL ) , in basal conditions and after incubation with drugs which modify the cellular concentration of cAMP , PGE and PGF .
The results demonstrated the presence in leukaemic cells of an alteration in the incorporation of steroid hormones .
This alteration was scarcely modified by incubation with theophylline:__entity__ , which increases cellular concentration of cAMP .
On the other hand , it was moderately counteracted by thioproline and was evidently inhibited by flurbiprofen , which also reduced cellular concentrations of prostaglandins , particularly PGE2 , with the exception of PGF2 which showed a poor response .
Differences were observed in the behavior of hormonal uptake of CML , in contrast to that of AML , CLL and ALL peripheral leucocytes .
Human breast cancer and impaired NK cell function .
Recent advances in tumor immunology have led to the discovery of a new lymphoid cell with unique antitumor activity .
Natural killer ( NK ) cells form an antitumor surveillance system and appear to be vital in preventing tumor growth and metastasis in animal models .
We studied NK activity in patients with benign and malignant breast disease , using a chromium-51 release microtiter cytotoxicity assay with K562 cells as targets .
Compared with benign controls , patients with malignancies had significantly depressed NK -mediated lysis ( P less than 0.01 ) .
Furthermore , lysis in those with advanced disease ( stages II , III , and IV ) was significantly less than in those with limited disease ( stage I ) ( P less than 0.01 ) .
NK activity was not correlated to estrogen or progesterone receptor states .
Positive correlation of a depressed natural killer activity with the extent of tumor spread supports the concept of an NK cell immune surveillance system in breast cancer and emphasizes its importance in this malignancy .
Immunosuppressive effect of serum progesterone during pregnancy depends on the progesterone binding capacity of the lymphocytes .
Cytotoxic activity and progesterone binding capacity of the lymphocytes , together with serum progesterone concentrations , were determined in women with normal pregnancy or with a clinical diagnosis of threatened abortion or threatened premature labour .
The lymphocytes of women with threatened abortion or threatened premature labour showed significantly higher cytotoxic activity ( P less than 0.001 ) and significantly lower progesterone binding capacity ( P less than 0.001 ) than did lymphocytes obtained from the healthy pregnant women .
Significant inverse correlation was found between progesterone binding capacity and cytotoxic activity of the lymphocytes ( P less than 0.001 ) , but the progesterone concentration of the pregnancy serum appeared to have no influence on the other two parameters .
The findings indicate that intact progesterone binding capacity of the lymphocytes is an essential factor for the manifestation of the blocking effect exerted by pregnancy serum on lymphocyte cytotoxicity in vitro .
Serum sex steroid and peptide hormone concentrations , and endometrial estrogen and progestin receptor levels during administration of human:__entity__ leukocyte:__entity__ interferon:__entity__ .
Five normally cycling healthy women were given daily subcutaneous injections of human:__entity__ leukocyte:__entity__ interferon:__entity__ ( 3 X 10 ( 6 ) units/day ) from the 3rd through 23rd day of the menstrual cycle , and serum steroid and peptide hormone concentrations monitored at 3-day intervals during the treatment and the preceding control cycle .
Concentrations of cytosol:__entity__ and:__entity__ nuclear:__entity__ estrogen:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ ( ERC:__entity__ and ERN:__entity__ , respectively ) and progestin:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ ( PRC:__entity__ and PRN:__entity__ ) were also measured from endometrial biopsies taken on the 24th day of the control and treatment cycle .
In addition , an extensive monitoring of clinical chemical and hematological tests from the blood samples were performed .
Serum estradiol and progesterone concentrations were significantly decreased during the treatment cycle , suggesting that interferon:__entity__ interacts in vivo with the function of both FSH and LH .
No significant changes were observed in the serum peptide hormone concentrations measured ( FSH , LH , prolactin , insulin , growth hormone and TSH ) ; neither were the levels of endometrial:__entity__ ERC:__entity__ ,:__entity__ ERN:__entity__ ,:__entity__ PRC:__entity__ and:__entity__ PRN:__entity__ affected by interferon:__entity__ administration .
As expected , interferon:__entity__ administration resulted in decreased leukocyte counts .
Moreover , an increasing tendency in the activities of serum:__entity__ alkaline:__entity__ phosphatase:__entity__ and gamma-glutamyltransferase:__entity__ during the interferon:__entity__ therapy shows that interferon:__entity__ may slightly interfere with the liver function .
These results suggest that one of the mechanisms by which interferon:__entity__ treatment may affect the growth of hormone-dependent neoplasms could be the interaction with production and/or function of circulating hormonal compounds .
[ Glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ level in the blood leukocytes in different acute diseases ]
Content of glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ in cytosol of blood leukocytes , concentration of cortisol and amount of leukocytes in blood were studied in 20 patients with acute impairments within the second day of the disease .
Content of receptors in cytosol of blood leukocytes was studied using 3H-triamcinolone acetonide .
Distinct increase in amount of the leukocyte:__entity__ glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ was found in patients with poisoning by dichlorethane and hypnotic drugs under conditions of acute myocardial infarction .
In acute pancreatitis content of the leukocyte:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ was not altered as compared with controls .
Concentration of endogenous cortisol was increased in blood of all the patients , except of the cases of acetate intoxication .
Reverse correlation was observed between concentration of cortisol in blood and content of glucocorticoid receptors in leukocytes .
But in the patients with acute pancreatitis the decrease in content of leukocyte:__entity__ glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ was not observed although there was an increase in cortisol concentration in blood .
The role of glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ in immunological processes under conditions of purulent complications and possibility to regulate the metabolism in leukocytes
Therapeutic concentrations of glucocorticoids suppress the antimicrobial activity of human macrophages without impairing their responsiveness to gamma:__entity__ interferon:__entity__ .
By exposing human blood-derived macrophages and alveolar macrophages in vitro to dexamethasone , we showed in these studies that glucocorticoids markedly suppress the antimicrobial activity of macrophages but not macrophage activation by lymphokines .
As little as 2.5 X 10 ( -8 ) mol/liter of dexamethasone prevented macrophages from inhibiting germination of Aspergillus spores or from eliminating ingested bacteria such as Listeria , Nocardia , or Salmonella .
Damage to macrophage function was inhibited by progesterone and appeared to be receptor-mediated .
In accordance with in vivo observations , dexamethasone required 24-36 h to suppress antimicrobial activity .
While glucocorticoids interfered with base-line activity of macrophages , dexamethasone concentrations comparable to drug levels in patients had no effect on macrophage activation .
Proliferating lymphocytes and gamma-interferon:__entity__ thus increased the antimicrobial activity of phagocytes exposed to glucocorticoids over that of control cells .
Macrophage activation and correction of the dexamethasone effect by gamma-interferon:__entity__ , however , was dependent on the pathogen .
The lymphokine:__entity__ enhanced the antimicrobial activity of dexamethasone-treated macrophages against Listeria and Salmonella but not against Aspergillus or Nocardia .
Dexamethasone-induced damage to the antimicrobial activity of human macrophages in vitro parallels observations that glucocorticoids render laboratory animals susceptible to listeriosis and aspergillosis by damaging resident macrophages .
Suppression of macrophage antimicrobial activity should thus be considered when treating patients with glucocorticoids ; its prevention by gamma-interferon:__entity__ might be beneficial for some but not all pathogens .
Interleukin:__entity__ 2:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ ( Tac:__entity__ antigen:__entity__ ) expression in HTLV-I-associated adult T-cell leukemia .
Interleukin-2:__entity__ ( IL-2:__entity__ ) is a lymphokine:__entity__ synthesized by some T-cells following activation .
Resting T-cells do not express IL-2:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ , but receptors are rapidly expressed on T-cells following interaction of antigens , mitogens , or monoclonal:__entity__ antibodies:__entity__ with the antigen-specific:__entity__ T-cell:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ complex:__entity__ .
Using anti-Tac:__entity__ , a monoclonal:__entity__ antibody:__entity__ that recognizes the IL-2:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ , the receptor has been purified and shown to be a Mr 33 , 000 peptide that is posttranslationally glycosylated to a Mr 55 , 000 mature form .
Normal resting T-cells and most leukemic T-cell populations do not express IL-2:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ ; however , the leukemic cells of the 11 patients examined who had human T-cell lymphotropic virus-associated adult T-cell leukemia expressed the Tac:__entity__ antigen:__entity__ .
In human T-cell lymphotropic virus-I infected cells , the Mr 42 , 000 long open:__entity__ reading:__entity__ frame:__entity__ protein:__entity__ encoded in part by the pX:__entity__ region:__entity__ of this virus may act as a transacting:__entity__ transcriptional:__entity__ activator:__entity__ that induces IL-2:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ gene:__entity__ transcription , thus providing an explanation for the constant association of IL-2:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ expression with adult T-cell lymphotropic virus-I infection of lymphoid cells .
The constant expression of large numbers of IL-2:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ which may be aberrant may play a role in the uncontrolled growth of adult T-cell leukemia cells .
Two patients with Tac-positive adult T-cell leukemia have been treated with the anti-Tac:__entity__ .
One of the patients had 6- and 3-mo remissions of his leukemia following two courses of therapy with this monoclonal:__entity__ antibody:__entity__ directed toward this growth:__entity__ factor:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ .
Lymphocyte glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ binding in depressed patients with hypercortisolemia .
Despite elevated levels of serum and urinary cortisol , patients with depressive illness manifest none of the clinical stigmata of glucocorticoid excess .
This hypercortisolemia in the absence of clinical effects suggests a state of hormone resistance and could be mediated by alterations in the glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ .
Earlier studies have shown that small doses of glucocorticoids cause a decrease in glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ binding in normal human lymphocytes .
White cells from depressed patients with significant hypercortisolemia would be expected to show a similar change in receptor concentration if peripheral tissues are adequately exposed to and sensitive to the hormone .
In this study we compared the binding of [ 3H ] dexamethasone to lymphocytes from normal subjects and depressed patients with hypercortisolemia .
Lymphocytes from normal subjects had a mean receptor concentration of 10.2 +/- 0.66 fm/10 ( 6 ) cells ( S.E.M. ) and a dissociation constant of 4.8 +/- 0.47 nM .
Lymphocytes from depressed patients with abnormal 0800 h serum cortisol after dexamethasone had a mean receptor concentration of 8.8 +/- 0.75 fm/10 ( 6 ) cells , which was not significantly different from that in lymphocytes from normal subjects or from depressed subjects with normal post-dexamethasone cortisol levels ( 9.4 +/- 0.95 fm/10 ( 6 ) cells ) .
Lymphocytes from depressed patients with elevated urinary free cortisol excretion ( UFC ) also had normal receptor concentration and binding affinity for dexamethasone .
The lack of a change in lymphocyte glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ concentration in the presence of cortisol excess suggests the possibility that hypercortisolemia in depressive illness represents a state of peripheral glucocorticoid resistance .
Structure and regulation of the glucocorticoid:__entity__ hormone:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ .
The glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ is an intracellular:__entity__ protein:__entity__ which possesses three distinct domains , one that binds agonist and antagonist steroids , one that binds DNA , and one that binds anti-receptor:__entity__ antibodies:__entity__ and is required for glucocorticoid modulation of gene expression .
In intact cells , receptor number , affinity and activity can change in response to factors that bind to the receptor , or that act indirectly through ill-defined mechanisms which may include resumption or arrest of cell cycling and variations in intracellular calcium ion concentrations .
Some of these factors appear to exert their effect by controlling critical receptor properties such as ATP-dependent phosphorylation , integrity of thiol:__entity__ groups:__entity__ , and exposure of key:__entity__ amino:__entity__ acid:__entity__ residues:__entity__ .
Glucocorticoid agonists promote the 'transformation ' of the receptor into the DNA-binding state , which is competent for modulating gene expression .
Glucocorticoid antagonists are steroids that interact with the receptor but either fail to produce a stable:__entity__ complex:__entity__ or produce a stable:__entity__ but:__entity__ inefficient:__entity__ complex:__entity__ .
Although substituent groups that confer agonist or antagonist activity to the steroid have been identified , the molecular determinants of this difference at the receptor level remain unknown .
Most in vitro and in vivo data on receptor regulation can be accommodated by postulating the existence of an intracellular cycle that involves five states of the receptor .
The active free receptor is phosphorylated , reduced , and presumably oligomeric ( state A ) .
Following binding of an agonist ( state B ) , it can become transformed by dissociation into its subunits and dephosphorylation ( state C ) .
The transformed:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ then interacts with chromatin:__entity__ ( state D ) .
Dissociation of the steroid and oxidation of receptor:__entity__ thiol:__entity__ group:__entity__ ( s ) lead to the inactive receptor form ( state E ) .
Reduction and rephosphorylation of the receptor enable it to bind steroids again so that the cycle is closed .
Thermodynamics of steroid binding to the human:__entity__ glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ .
The thermodynamics of the interaction of glucocorticoids with their receptor were studied in cytosol from human lymphoblastoid cells .
The rate and affinity constants of dexamethasone and cortisol between 0 degree and 25 degrees C were calculated by curve-fitting from time-course and equilibrium kinetics .
The data were consistent with a simple reversible bimolecular interaction .
Arrhenius and Va n't Hoff plots were curvilinear for both steroids .
At equilibrium , the solution for the equation delta G = delta H - T X delta S ( eqn. 1 ) was ( in kJ X mol-1 ) -47 = 36 - 83 ( dexamethasone ) and -42 = -9 - 33 ( cortisol ) at 0 degree C .
Enthalpy and entropy changes decreased quasi-linearly with temperature such that , at 25 degrees C , the respective values were -50 = -75 + 25 and -43 = -48 + 5 .
Thus , for both steroids , the interaction was entropy-driven at low temperature and became entirely enthalpy-driven at 20 degrees C .
Thermodynamic values for the transition state were calculated from the rate constants .
For the forward reaction , eqn. ( 1 ) gave 45 = 84 - 39 ( dexamethasone ) and 46 = 60 - 14 ( cortisol ) at 0 degree C , and 44 = 24 + 20 ( dexamethasone ) and 46 = 28 + 18 ( cortisol ) at 25 degrees C .
These data fit quite well with a two-step model [ Ross & Subramanian ( 1981 ) Biochemistry 20 , 3096-3102 ] proposed for ligand-protein interactions , which involves a partial immobilization of the reacting species governed by hydrophobic forces , followed by stabilization of the complex by short-range interactions .
On the basis of this model , an analysis of the transition-state thermodynamics led to the conclusion that no more than half of the steroid molecular area is engaged in the binding process .
Cell cycle-related changes in number of T-lymphocyte:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ for glucocorticoids and insulin .
Enriched human peripheral T-lymphocytes were stimulated with PHA and examined for variations in insulin and glucocorticoid ( dexamethasone ) receptor numbers during the early phases of the cell cycle .
Cells in G0 , G1a and G1b phases , where the G1a - G1b transition is an Interleukin:__entity__ 2:__entity__ dependent event , were quantitated by flow cytometry .
Few but significant numbers of glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ ( 2700/cell ) and no insulin:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ ( -1/cell ) were found in the resting ( G0 ) phase .
As cells entered the G1a phase the specific binding of dexamethasone increased and of insulin took place .
Although the specific binding further increased as T-cells entered the G1b phase ( as measured at 44 h of incubation and using hydroxyurea-treated cells ) , the major changes in the specific binding of dexamethasone took place during the period 16 - 20 h after stimulation .
Based on these findings , it is concluded that both receptor types ( cell:__entity__ membrane:__entity__ and:__entity__ cytoplasmic:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ ) are being formed and increased at G1 phase prior to cell proliferation , indicating the importance of G1 phase in immunoregulation .
Glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ and cortico-sensitivity in a human clonal monocytic cell line , CM-SM .
CM-SM is a clonal line of human precursor mononuclear phagocytes inducible to macrophage differentiation in response to the tumor promoter phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) .
Untreated CM-SM cells contain single class , high-affinity ( KD = 4.0 X 10 ( -9 ) M ) glucocorticoid-specific receptor sites ( approximately 60 , 000 per cell ) , as measured by a whole cell assay , at 37 degrees C , using [ 3H ] triamcinolone acetonide ( TA ) .
Exposure of CM-SM to dexamethasone ( DEX ) produced a progressive , dose- and time-related series of changes in CM-SM cell growth , saturation density , morphology , and functional properties , with half-maximal effects at about 10 ( -9 ) M for DEX .
TA-receptor sites rapidly decreased ( about 70 % ) after DEX treatment , without any apparent change in steroid specificity and affinity .
After 5 days in culture with a saturating concentration ( 3.6 X 10 ( -8 ) M ) of hormone , the cells reached a saturation density of about 9.0 X 10 ( 6 ) viable cells/ml ( about 4.0 X 10 ( 6 ) viable cells/ml in the controls ) , while the modal volume of the resulting cell population was approximately 60 % , as compared to the volume of untreated cells .
DEX-treated cells appeared less differentiated than controls , as assessed by combined morphologic , antigenic , and cytoenzymatic analyses .
DEX almost completely inhibited TPA activation of the following macrophage functions : adherency to the culture plate , expression of lysosomal:__entity__ enzymes:__entity__ , Fc:__entity__ and:__entity__ C3:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ , and stimulation of phagocytosis .
After removal of DEX , the cells , within a few passages , returned to a state apparently identical to the untreated controls and could be induced to macrophage differentiation in response to TPA .
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children : current status , controversies , and future perspective .
Disease-free survival ( DFS ) in childhood ALL is 60 % , and survival in good , average , and poor prognostic groups defined by initial WBC and age is 90 , 60 , and 45 % , respectively .
Additional immunological , morphological , biochemical , cytokinetic , and cytogenetic factors have been identified , illustrating the heterogeneity of ALL and its derivation from malignant clones at various stages of differentiation and with varying rates of proliferation .
Of biologic importance , these factors may refine further the characteristic features of clinically-determined prognostic groups .
Multivariate analysis of large prospective trials with homogeneous therapy will be required to determine the independent prognostic importance of these factors .
Current treatment strategies in ALL include ( 1 ) tailoring therapy and its intensity to prognostic groups ; ( 2 ) multiple-drug combinations in induction ; ( 3 ) early use of intrathecal ( IT ) methotrexate ( MTX ) ; ( 4 ) CNS prophylaxis with IT MTX alone in good prognosis patients and combined cranial radiation ( CXRT ) , 1800 rads plus IT MTX , in average and poor prognosis patients .
Current studies show a CNS relapse rate of 5 % in all prognostic groups .
Late neuropsychological defects caused by cranial XRT and IT MTX have prompted programs designed to reduce the potential late toxicity of CNS prophylaxis .
More pronounced in younger children , these abnormalities include decreased IQ , visual-motor incoordination , poor performance in mathematics , and memory dysfunction .
Until 1980 , more intensive induction , consolidation , and maintenance therapy had failed to prolong DFS in children with a poor prognosis .
In West Germany ( Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster protocol ) a 70 to 75 % DFS is seen in all patients regardless of initial WBC , suggesting that effective therapy will override prognostic factors .
Ultra-high-dose MTX , without cranial radiation , is also showing promise in poor prognosis patients .
Other issues include the optimal duration of therapy , the role of testicular biopsies , and prophylactic testicular radiation .
Recent studies suggest that prognostic factors lose their significance after 2 years of continuous complete remission and that 2 years of maintenance therapy is adequate .
Bilateral open-wedge testicular biopsies have identified occult testicular disease in 8 to 10 % of males .
A unified approach to children with leukemia/lymphoma , a group with a particularly poor prognosis , utilizing NHL-type therapy may be more effective than conventional ALL therapy .
( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS )
Glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ and in vitro sensitivity to steroid hormones in human lymphoproliferative diseases and myeloid leukemia .
The glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ ( GR:__entity__ ) quantitation by a whole-cell assay and/or cytosol technique and the in vitro sensitivity to steroids have been assessed in peripheral blood cells from normal donors and patients with chronic lymphatic leukemia ( CLL ) , acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) , lymphosarcoma cell leukemia ( LSCL ) , acute nonlymphatic leukemia ( ANLL ) , and chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) .
Within the lymphoproliferative diseases , ALL cells exhibited the highest GR:__entity__ concentration ( regardless of the method used ) and the highest in vitro inhibition of spontaneous [ 3H ] thymidine ( [ 3H ] TdR ) uptake by glucocorticoids .
A significant relationship between GR:__entity__ concentration ( whole-cell assay ) and in vitro sensitivity to dexamethasone was also found .
On the contrary , CLL cells presented the highest sensitivity to glucocorticoids in PHA-stimulated cell cultures .
Cells from the only two ALL patients who did not undergo a remission after glucocorticoid-inclusive chemotherapy had both the lowest in vitro sensitivity to dexamethasone and the lowest GR concentration with whole-cell assay .
Concerning myeloid leukemia , ANLL patients had GR:__entity__ concentrations slightly higher than those found in the ALL group but exhibited the lowest degree of inhibition of spontaneous [ 3H ] TdR uptake by dexamethasone ( stimulatory effects occurred in some cases ) .
CML cells exhibited an inhibition degree by in vitro glucocorticoids significantly higher than that of ANLL cells but not different from that of lymphoproliferative diseases .
No clear relationship among GR pattern , in vitro cell sensitivity to glucocorticoids , and clinicohematologic parameters was observed in myeloid leukemia-bearing patients .
Glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ and in vitro corticosensitivity of peanut-positive and peanut-negative human thymocyte subpopulations .
In 6 human thymus glands , the immature subset of thymocytes was separated from the more mature one , by differential peanut lectin agglutination .
These 2 cell subpopulations were analyzed for glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ content by using a whole cell assay , with ( 3H ) -triamcinolone acetonide as tracer .
The unagglutinated thymocytes ( peanut negative ) contained about 2 times more receptor sites per cell than agglutinated ( peanut positive ) ones ( 7650 +/- 1550 S.D. verus 3195 +/- 896 S.D. ) .
The affinity for steroid was similar in both cell subsets , as was the stereospecificity for glucocorticoids , the time-course of steroid-receptor association , and cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation .
Despite the greater number of glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ sites , the peanut-negative thymocyte subpopulation did not differ from the peanut-positive one in its sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of triamcinolone acetonide , as determined by measurements of the incorporation of radiolabeled precursors of protein and DNA .
Moreover , the peanut-negative subset appeared more resistant in vitro to the steroid-induced cell lysis as compared to the peanut-positive one .
Thus , our data suggest that glucocorticoid receptor density and corticosensitivity are not directly correlated and that the number of glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ sites may be dependent on the degree of immunologic maturation
Defective binding and function of 1:__entity__ ,:__entity__ 25-dihydroxyvitamin:__entity__ D3:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ in peripheral mononuclear cells of patients with end-organ resistance to 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D .
Lectin-induced DNA synthesis by peripheral mononuclear cells from 17 normal donors was inhibited ( 40-60 % ) by 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1 , 25 [ OH ] 2D3 ) at physiological concentrations ( 10 ( -10 ) -10 ( -9 ) M ) .
The lymphocytes acquire specific receptors for 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 upon activation by the lectins:__entity__ .
This process precedes the inhibitory effect of 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 .
We studied lymphocytes from six patients from four different kindreds with the syndrome of hereditary end-organ resistance to 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D ( the so-called vitamin D-dependent rickets type II ) .
In five patients ( three kindreds ) peripheral blood mononuclear cells did not acquire receptors for 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 upon phytohemagglutinin-induced activation .
Moreover , in contrast to normal lymphocytes , the mitogenic stimulation of these patients ' lymphocytes by phytohemagglutinin:__entity__ and concanavalin A was not inhibited by 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 .
Activated lymphocytes of the sixth patient from a fourth kindred exhibited normal binding of [ 3H ] 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 but the hormone failed to inhibit the mitogenic stimulation .
A similar pattern of the vitamin D effector system was previously observed in fibroblasts cultured from skin biopsies of the same group of patients .
The conclusions from these findings are : ( a ) the inhibition of mitogenic stimulation by 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 is mediated by specific:__entity__ functional:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ to the hormone ; and ( b ) the receptors for 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 in mononuclear cells are probably controlled genetically by the same mechanisms as the effector system in well-characterized target organs of the hormone , such as intestine and kidney .
Glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ of mononuclear leukocytes from myasthenia gravis patients .
The present study was performed to analyse glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ ( GR:__entity__ ) binding in peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes ( MNL ) from 39 myasthenia gravis ( MG ) patients ( unoperated patients ( n = 13 ) , thymectomized patients ( n = 14 ) and patients receiving glucocorticoids : thymectomized ( n = 11 ) and unoperated ( n = 6 ] .
A whole cell binding assay with 3 ( H ) dexamethasone was used .
GR:__entity__ mean values were significantly higher in the MNL of MG patients ( thymectomized or not ) not receiving glucocorticoid than in the MNL of healthy donors .
Affinity was within the normal range .
Sex , age or clinical forms of illness did not influence the results .
In patients receiving prednisone ( Pd ) the GR:__entity__ values were significantly lower than in MG patients without Pd therapy , independent of Pd dose or time of administration .
No differences in receptor binding between normal subjects and MG patients receiving Pd have been found .
Immunological interference of high dose corticosteroids .
High-dose corticosteroids ( HDC ) will influence cellular as well as humoral participants of the immune response .
The lymphoid tissue will decrease in size and weight after prolonged treatment with HDC .
Lymphocyte functions will be impaired .
Reduced synthesis of B- as well as T-lymphocytes will be seen .
The inhibitory effect on B-cell function can be observed both as decreased serum levels of immunoglobulins:__entity__ and as impaired binding of antibodies:__entity__ and complement to the cellular surface .
Reduced T-cell function indicated by impaired stimulation by PHA:__entity__ and porkweed:__entity__ as well as by impaired lymphokinin effects on leukocyte migration inhibition has been reported .
Reduced lymphocyte adherence to antigen and suppressed lymphocyte reaction have also been observed .
Humoral factors involved in chemotaxis , opsonisation , phagocytosis , vascular permeability leading to leakage of fluid and cells and factors involved in lysis of antigens are impaired .
This can be explained partly by the observed reduced complement activation via the alternative as well as the classical pathway in association with HDC therapy .
Acute processes with increased vascular permeability and accumulation of leukocytes as impairing factors could be influenced beneficially by HDC therapy .
This positive effect can be seen in treatment of septic shock or rejection of a transplant .
However , if sepsis or rejection is not rapidly reversed , complications such as multisystem organ failure and bacteremia are prone to appear .
Identification of human:__entity__ leukemic:__entity__ glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ using affinity labeling and anti-human:__entity__ glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ antibodies:__entity__ .
Antisera raised against human:__entity__ lymphoid:__entity__ glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ were used in combination with the glucocorticoid receptor affinity label [ 3H ] dexamethasone 21-mesylate [ ( 3H ] DM ) to identify the glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ of the human B-lymphoblastoid cell line IM-9 and the human T-cell leukemic cell line CEM-C7 .
Antisera were obtained following immunization of New Zealand White rabbits with [:__entity__ 3H:__entity__ ]:__entity__ triamcinolone:__entity__ acetonide:__entity__ [:__entity__ (:__entity__ 3H:__entity__ ]:__entity__ TA:__entity__ ):__entity__ -glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ complexes:__entity__ partially purified by two-stage DNA-cellulose chromatography .
The presence of anti-human:__entity__ glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ antibodies:__entity__ was verified by : ( a ) adsorption of [:__entity__ 3H:__entity__ ]:__entity__ TA-receptor-antibody:__entity__ complexes:__entity__ to Protein:__entity__ A:__entity__ ; ( b ) a shift to higher apparent molecular weight in the elution position from Sephacryl S300 of [:__entity__ 3H:__entity__ ]:__entity__ TA-receptor:__entity__ complexes:__entity__ incubated with immune serum ; and ( c ) the ability of immune serum to displace [:__entity__ 3H:__entity__ ]:__entity__ TA-receptor:__entity__ complexes:__entity__ on sucrose gradients .
These antibodies:__entity__ also recognized rat liver and murine:__entity__ S49:__entity__ cell:__entity__ glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ .
Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of [ 3H ] DM-labeled IM-9 cytosol identified a major competable band with a molecular weight of approximately 90 , 000 , three minor competable components with molecular weights of approximately 78 , 000 , approximately 51 , 000 , and approximately 38 , 500 , and at least 21 other noncompetable components .
Following immunoprecipitation of [ 3H ] DM-labeled cytosol with immune serum , only the Mr 90 , 000 and 78 , 000 components were seen .
Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of [ 3H ] DM-labeled CEM-C7 cytosol revealed a larger number of [ 3H ] DM-labeled components .
However , after immunoprecipitation of [ 3H ] DM-labeled CEM-C7 cytosol , a predominant competable component with a molecular weight of 90 , 000 was easily identified .
This component was markedly diminished when cytosols from the glucocorticoid receptor-deficient cell line ICR-27 were used .
Thus , the combination of affinity labeling and anti-human:__entity__ glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ antibodies:__entity__ is capable of providing direct physical identification of human:__entity__ lymphoid:__entity__ glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ .
Effect of thymosin on glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ activity and glucocorticoid sensitivity of human thymocytes .
Incubation with thymosin fraction 5 , ( TMS F5 at 300 micrograms/ml ) a partially purified thymic factor , reduced the steroid binding activity of human infant thymocytes from 9.6 +/- 2.1 fmole/ml to 5.0 +/- 2.0 fmole/ml .
The glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ activity in normal infant thymocytes was found to be 2 , 146 +/- 726 ( s.d. ) sites per cell with dissociation constant of 1.4 +/- 0.6 X 10 ( -8 ) M .
TMS F5 also increased the resistance of human thymocytes to the cytolytic effect of dexamethasone ( 2.5 X 10 ( -8 ) M ) to 168.6 +/- 30.2 % of control ( P less than 0.01 ) .
In animals , medullary and peripheral blood T cells are more resistant to glucocorticoids than immature thymic T cells .
The results show that thymosin can induce changes consistent with differentiation in human thymocytes .
These in vitro results are consistent with a physiological role of thymosin in intrathymic T cell maturation in man .
Incubation of a human malignant thymus derived T cell line ( MOLT 3 ) with TMS F5 also resulted in a significant reduction of the number of steroid binding sites to 44.2 +/- 15.3 % of control ( P less than 0.05 ) , but TMS F5 did not significantly reduce the glucocorticoid sensitivity of MOLT 3 cells .
Specific:__entity__ high-affinity:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ for 1 , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells : presence in monocytes and induction in T lymphocytes following activation .
Human peripheral blood monocytes have high affinity binding sites for 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 ( Kd 0.14 nM , sedimentation coefficient 3.7S ) .
Resting human peripheral blood T lymphocytes , however , do not have a demonstrable 1:__entity__ ,:__entity__ 25-:__entity__ (:__entity__ OH:__entity__ ):__entity__ 2D3:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ .
After activation with phytohemagglutinin:__entity__ the T cells exhibit the receptor within 24 h , and this expression is blocked by cycloheximide .
The receptor in activated T lymphocytes has a sedimentation coefficient of 3.7S and a high affinity ( Kd 0.10 nM ) for the ligand .
Effects of chronic glucocorticoid excess in man on insulin binding to circulating cells : differences between endogenous and exogenous hypercorticism .
We measured [ 125I ] insulin binding to circulating monocytes or erythrocytes from 16 patients with chronic glucocorticoid excess , 9 chronically treated with prednisone and 7 with adrenocortical hyperfunction .
With monocytes , [ 125I ] insulin binding was iincreased in all patients .
Analysis of binding data indicated that increased binding in patients treated with prednisone was due to an ncrease in receptor concentration , whereas in patients with adrenocortical hyperfunction , it was due to an increase in receptor affinity .
With erythrocytes from patients with adrenocortical hyperfunction there was an increase in receptor affinity and a decrease in receptor concentration , so that the binding of [ 125I ] insulin was normal .
The disparity of results between endogenous and exogenous hypercorticism , between the two cell types , and between the present studies and previous studies suggest that the effects of glucocorticoid excess on the insulin:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ are extremely complex and wide-ranging and that in this condition , extrapolations in humans from data with circulating cells to liver and muscle may not be appropriate .
Reduced level of cellular:__entity__ glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ in patients with anorexia nervosa .
Specific glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ were measured in circulating mononuclear leukocytes from 12 patients with anorexia nervosa and 21 healthy control subjects .
Cells from patients were found to contain a significantly ( p less than 0.01 ) lower level of glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ ( 3830 +/- 210 sites/cell , mean +/- SE ) than those from controls ( 4930 +/- 250 sites/cell ) .
A partial glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ defect may well explain the abnormal cortisol metabolism and glucocorticoid resistance commonly found in patients with anorexia nervosa .
Regulation of the glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ in human lymphocytes .
The presence of a glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ in human lymphocytes is well established , but factors affecting its regulation have not been described .
Using a competitive binding whole cell assay , we have examined the binding of [ 3H ] -dexamethasone at 24 and 37 degrees C in untreated normal subjects and in healthy subjects taking various glucocorticoid preparations .
At 24 degrees C normal human lymphocytes had 6000 binding sites/cell and a dissociation constant of 4 x 10 ( -9 ) M .
The administration of 1 mg of dexamethasone , 5 mg of prednisone , and 37.5 mg of cortisone acetate resulted in a 30 % decrease in binding sites after 1 week with no change in binding affinity .
No changes in the number of binding sites was noted before 1 week and the diminished number persisted for 1 week after discontinuation of glucocorticoid treatment .
Lymphocytes from hospitalized patients taking 40-60 mg of dexamethasone daily demonstrated the same change in number of binding sites that was seen in normal subjects taking 1 mg of dexamethasone .
When binding assays were carried out at physiologic temperature there was the same decrease in number of binding sites after dexamethasone administration , and in addition , there was a two-fold increase in binding affinity .
Glucocorticoid administration results in a time-dependent decrease in the number of lymphocyte glucocorticoid binding sites that is independent of the type of glucocorticoid administered .
This is the first in vivo demonstration that glucocorticoids modulate their own receptors in man .
Immunoglobulin localization in benign and malignant lesions of the human mammary gland .
Using direct imunofluorescence , lesions from 266 human breast specimens were studied for the presence of IgA , IgM , or IgG localization .
The lesions included benign elements from 66 subcutaneous mastectomy specimens in which the absence of simultaneous breast malignancy was documented , primary breast carcinomas from 153 mastectomy specimens , and 47 biopsies containing metastatic breast cancer .
A statistically significant association of IgA:__entity__ and IgM:__entity__ with benign lesions was contrasted to the association of IgG:__entity__ with malignant lesions .
In both primary and metastatic lesions , IgG:__entity__ localization was associated with estrogen-receptor-poor primary cancers as compared with estrogen-receptor-rich primary cancers .
Among primary breast cancer patients , IgG:__entity__ localization in the tumor correlated with relative lymphopenia .
A shorter disease-free interval was noted in association with IgG:__entity__ localization among the metastatic breast lesions .
No statistically significant association between stage of disease and immunoglobulin presence was demonstrable .
Moderate-to-severe intraductal epithelial hyperplasias were more often associated with immunoglobulin:__entity__ G:__entity__ localization that were other benign lesions
Correlation of steroid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ with histologic differentiation in mammary carcinoma .
A Singapore experience .
Cancer of the breast is the most common tumor in females in Singapore , with the rate of 20.7 per 100 , 000 per year ( 1977 estimate ) , which is predicted to increase to 29.8 per 100 , 000 women per year by 1995 .
A detailed histopathologic review of 50 primary breast cancer tumors analyzed for estrogen:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ ( ER:__entity__ ) level was carried out and a variety of morphologic features correlated with ER:__entity__ results to identify any factors that will improve the management and prognosis for breast cancer .
Cytosol was incubated with 3H-estradiol in the presence and absence of cold diethylstilbestrol , and bound and free hormone were separated by Dextran-coated charcoal method .
Tumors binding more than 5 fmol/mg cytosol:__entity__ protein:__entity__ were classified as ER:__entity__ -positive .
Progesterone:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ ( PR:__entity__ ) level was analyzed in some specimens with the use of a similar method .
Most of the patients were Chinese ( 90 % ) .
Three patients were Malays , one was Indian , and one was European in this series .
Results indicated that there was strong correlation between ER:__entity__ level , age , and histologic grade of the tumors .
No correlation existed between absence or presence of lymph node metastases and ER:__entity__ .
Although there was a trend for ER:__entity__ -positive tumors to have a low-grade lymphocytic infiltration , the difference was not statistically significant .
Mononuclear cells infiltrating human mammary carcinomas : immunohistochemical analysis with monoclonal:__entity__ antibodies:__entity__ .
Breast carcinomas were examined by the immunoperoxidase technique using antisera specific for lymphocyte subsets , monocytes , NK cells and major:__entity__ histocompatibility:__entity__ antigens:__entity__ ( HLA-A:__entity__ , -B:__entity__ , -C ; Ia-like:__entity__ ) .
Sixty-four per cent of the patients had a moderate or strong mononuclear cell infiltration , 77 % of the patients without mononuclear cell infiltration had receptors for estrogens as compared to 51 % of the patients with infiltration .
The majority of the infiltrating mononuclear cells were T cells ; generally the OKT8 cells were predominant .
The Leu 3A/OKT8 cell ratio was not related to histological type , tumor size , age of the patient or presence of metastases .
Some of the T cells had the Ia:__entity__ antigen:__entity__ and were thus probably activated .
The B cells were either absent or less numerous than the T cells .
There was no relation between their distribution and the various parameters studied .
A few monocytes were heterogeneous according to their markers ( OKM:__entity__ I:__entity__ and acid phosphatase ) .
In 6 cases only there was a strong infiltration of mononuclear cells positive for acid:__entity__ phosphatase:__entity__ .
The number of the natural killer cells was also low .
Only a few mononuclear infiltrating cells had receptors for transferrin .
There was a positive correlation between the inflammatory infiltration and the presence of HLA:__entity__ class-I:__entity__ antigens:__entity__ on tumor cell s .
Some of the antisera specific for lymphocyte subsets also stained the breast carcinoma cells .
The great variations in the subsets of mononuclear cells in breast carcinomas may correspond to various systems of defense against neoplasm .
A case of male pseudohermaphroditism with normal androgen:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ binding and 47 , XYY karyotype .
A case of male pseudohermaphroditism with 47 , XYY karyotype in blood and cutaneous fibroblasts is described .
The plasma testosterone response to HCG stimulation was slightly below the normal range on two occasions suggesting a deficit of gonadal function .
A study of the receptors for dihydrotestosterone in fibroblasts of genital and nongenital skin showed a normal concentration of receptors in genital skin ; 5-alpha-reductase:__entity__ activity in fibroblasts of the genital skin was low , but the plasma relationship testosterone/dihydrotestosterone under HCG stimulation was normal .
The diagnostic possibility of a complete testicular feminization syndrome with normal receptors for dihydrotestosterone is commented on .
1 , 25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 inhibits antigen-induced T cell activation .
The proliferative response of murine spleen and thymus cells to antigen:__entity__ but not to lectin:__entity__ was inhibited by the active metabolite of vitamin D3 , 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 .
To directly examine the effect of 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 on T cell activation in the absence of other complicating interactions , we utilized a panel of cloned Ia-restricted T cell hybridomas that secrete IL:__entity__ 2:__entity__ on activation by cloned Ia-bearing stimulator cells ( TA3 ) or when stimulated by mitogen .
Physiologic concentrations of 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 ( 0.01 to 0.1 nm ) inhibited the antigen-induced secretion of IL 2 by several of these T cell hybridomas .
This inhibition was dependent on the concentration of the free hormone and could be overcome by increasing the number of Ia-bearing stimulator cells used .
Pretreatment of the T hybridoma but not the TA3 stimulator cell with 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 resulted in inhibition of activation .
These results are consistent with the finding that specific 1:__entity__ ,:__entity__ 25-:__entity__ (:__entity__ OH:__entity__ ):__entity__ 2D3:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ are present on the T cell hybridomas but are lacking in TA3 cells .
1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 failed , however , to inhibit the activation of the T cell hybridomas by lectin:__entity__ or by an anti-Thy-1:__entity__ antibody:__entity__ .
These findings suggest that 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 may be interfering with early events of antigen-induced T cell activation , perhaps by hindering T cell recognition of the relevant antigen on stimulator cell surfaces .
This system should prove useful in studying the molecular mechanisms by which 1 , 25- ( OH ) 2D3 acts to inhibit T cell activation and subsequent IL:__entity__ 2:__entity__ production .
Glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ and steroid sensitivity in normal and neoplastic human lymphoid tissues : a review .
The determination of estrogen:__entity__ and:__entity__ progesterone:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ in breast cancer has been shown to be useful in predicting the response to endocrine therapy .
Given their well-known inhibitory effects on lymphoid tissue , glucocorticoids have been used widely in the treatment of leukemia .
Given these facts , over the last 10 years , several investigators have measured the number of glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ in normal and neoplastic lymphoid tissue to see whether their number correlated with glucocorticoid responsiveness in vitro or in vivo .
No clear correlation could be established between the level of glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ and the in vitro action of steroids in normal and neoplastic lymphoid tissue .
In contrast , attempts to correlate glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ levels in acute lymphocytic leukemia to in vivo steroid responsiveness and immunological type using the whole-cell-binding assay for receptor determination and selecting the patients according to age and immunological criteria have been more successful .
[ Glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ in normal human lymphocytes ]
Glucocorticoid ( GC ) receptors were studied in intact lymphocytes from 11 donors .
GC binding parameters were found to be highly reproducible in repeated experiments with lymphocytes .
It was shown that GC:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ in donors ' lymphocytes could be distributed into two different classes similarly to the pattern seen in skin fibroblasts .
Human lymphocytes are an adequate object for studying genetically determined variability of GC:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ and its clinical importance .
Specific estrogen:__entity__ binding:__entity__ sites:__entity__ in human lymphoid cells and thymic cells .
The binding of estrogen in preparations of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells , as well as by splenic and thymic cells is demonstrated by three different approaches ( Dextran-coated charcoal method , whole cell assay , and gel filtration on a sepharose 4B column ) .
Scatchard 's analysis of [ 3H ] -moxestrol ( R2858 ) and [ 3H ] -estradiol binding proves the existence of a single class of receptor:__entity__ sites:__entity__ having a dissociation constant of 0.18-2.4 X 10 ( -9 ) M .
Physicochemical properties of the binder , including binding capacity and steroid specificity , are quite similar to those reported for the thymus of small mammalian species or human thymoma .
Administration of fibroblast:__entity__ interferon:__entity__ to patients with advanced breast cancer : possible effects on skin metastasis and on hormone:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ .
Eleven patients with metastasized breast cancer received 8 intramuscular injections of 6 x 10 ( 6 ) units of human:__entity__ fibroblast:__entity__ interferon:__entity__ over a period of 40 days .
The injections did not cause local irritation or inflammation .
Fever occurred in only 1 of the 11 patients .
Although several types of metastases were monitored , only skin nodules consistently ( 10 out of 11 patients ) exhibited changes that were suggestive of a therapeutic effect of the treatment regimen : either a simple decrease in size of some nodules or central necrosis accompanied by an inflammatory reaction .
NK-activity of peripheral blood leukocytes was significantly increased after administration of the first dose ; the effect of subsequent injections was less clear .
Receptors for estrogens and progestogens were increased in the tumor biopsies of 2 out of 2 and 5 out of 6 patients tested respectively .
Decreased glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ binding in adrenal insufficiency .
To examine the effect of glucocorticoid deficiency on the glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ , we examine the binding of [ 3H ] dexamethasone to lymphocytes in normal subjects and patients with adrenal insufficiency before and after glucocorticoid replacement therapy .
Using a whole cell competitive binding assay , normal human lymphocytes had 5977 +/- 1487 ( mean +/- SD ) binding sites/cell and a dissociation constant of 10 +/- 2 nM .
Lymphocytes from patients with untreated adrenal insufficiency had fewer binding:__entity__ sites:__entity__ ( 3364 +/-322 ) and a 2-fold increase in binding affinity ( 5.4 +/- 0.9 mM ) .
The administration of conventional replacement doses of cortisone acetate for 6 months caused no change in receptor number , but was associated with a decrease in binding affinity toward normal .
After long term glucocorticoid replacement therapy , binding parameters were similar to those in patients before treatment .
The physiological implications of the decreased receptor number and increased binding affinity in adrenal insufficiency remain to be elucidated .
Glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ concentrations and terminal transferase:__entity__ activity as indicators of prognosis in acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia .
Activity of terminal:__entity__ deoxynucleotidyl:__entity__ transferase:__entity__ ( TdT:__entity__ ) , adenosine:__entity__ deaminase:__entity__ , and 5'nucleotidase:__entity__ and the cellular concentration of glucocorticoid:__entity__ (:__entity__ dexamethasone:__entity__ ):__entity__ receptor:__entity__ were determined in 25 patients with acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia .
All patients were treated according to a common protocol .
Increased activity of TdT:__entity__ ( greater than 0.1 unit/microgram DNA ) was found in 11 patients .
This group of patients was shown to have higher remission and survival rates ( p = 0.06 ) compared with patients with low activity of TdT .
The glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ concentration of the leukaemic blast cells ranged from 0 to 0.94 fmol/microgram DNA .
Thirteen patients had blast cells with a glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ concentration over 0.22 fmol/microgram DNA .
These patients had significantly increased remission and survival rates ( p = 0.006 ) compared with those with a low receptor concentration .
This finding can not be explained by a difference in sensitivity to glucocorticoids since these were not used as therapeutic agents .
Adenosine:__entity__ deaminase:__entity__ and 5'nucleotidase:__entity__ activities both varied within two orders of magnitude .
No correlation could be found between activities of these enzymes and remission or survival rate .
These results show that measurements of TdT:__entity__ activity and the glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ concentration yield valuable prognostic information in acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia
[ 3H ] cortivazol : a unique high affinity ligand for the glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ .
Cortivazol ( CVZ ) and deacylcortivazol ( DAC ) are pyrazolosteroids with potent glucocorticoid activity .
In previous work we showed that DAC is 40-fold more potent than dexamethasone ( DEX ) in lysing leukemic lymphoblasts .
To assess the interaction between these atypical steroids and the glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ , we examined the binding of [ 3H ] CVZ to cytosol from glucocorticoid-sensitive and -resistant variants of the human leukemic cell line CEM C7 .
In glucocorticoid-sensitive cells [ 3H ] CVZ causes a 2-fold induction of glutamine:__entity__ synthetase:__entity__ and binds to a protein in the 4.6 S region of high salt sucrose gradients .
On DEAE-cellulose chromatography , [:__entity__ 3H:__entity__ ]:__entity__ CVZ-receptor:__entity__ complexes:__entity__ show a shift from high ( 0.25 M KP ) to low salt ( 0.09 M KP ) eluting forms upon activation .
CVZ competes for a 97 , 000-dalton protein labeled by [ 3H ] dexamethasone mesylate .
Scatchard analysis of the binding of [ 3H ] CVZ in glucocorticoid-sensitive cells revealed a curvilinear plot which resolved into high ( 0.4 nM ) and low ( 11 nM ) affinity components .
The receptor concentration of the low affinity site ( 0.30 pmol/mg protein ) was approximately twice that of the high:__entity__ affinity:__entity__ site:__entity__ ( 0.14 pmol/mg protein ) .
Dissociation experiments with dilution and/or excess unlabeled CVZ supported the presence of independent sites .
In contrast , the binding of [ 3H ] DEX to C7 cytosol revealed a single class of binding sites ( Kd = 1.9 nM ; receptor concentration , 0.46 pmol/mg protein ) .
Examination of the binding of [ 3H ] CVZ using 10 ( -5 ) M DEX as the competing ligand showed that DEX binds only to the low affinity site detected by [ 3H ] CVZ .
In cytosol from a glucocorticoid-resistant cell line with virtually no [ 3H ] DEX binding , [ 3H ] CVZ detected a single high:__entity__ affinity:__entity__ binding:__entity__ site:__entity__ that was similar in dissociation constant ( 0.8 nM ) and receptor concentration ( 0.13 pmol/mg protein ) to the high:__entity__ affinity:__entity__ site:__entity__ detected in the glucocorticoid-sensitive cell line C7 .
A controlled pore glass bead assay for the measurement of cytoplasmic:__entity__ and:__entity__ nuclear:__entity__ glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ .
An assay for the quantitation of cytoplasmic:__entity__ and:__entity__ nuclear:__entity__ glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ in lymphoid tissue has been developed using controlled pore glass ( CPG ) beads .
Soluble receptor:__entity__ --:__entity__ 3H-steroid:__entity__ complex:__entity__ ( cytosol or nuclear extract ) is adsorbed quantitatively within the crevasses of porous glass beads .
Excess labeled steroid as well as most non-specifically bound steroid is easily washed away , leaving the hormone-receptor:__entity__ complex:__entity__ retained by the beads .
Bound 3H-steroid is eluted with ethanol and measured for radioactivity .
This procedure which is simple , rapid , and highly reproducible is carried out using frozen samples ( stable for many months ) containing as few as 1 X 10 ( 7 ) cells .
A comparison of the CPG assay to dextran coated charcoal and a whole cell assay demonstrates that CPG and dextran coated charcoal give equivalent measurements of cytosolic:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ concentration , while the CPG and whole cell assays provide equivalent values for total receptor content .
Plasmacytoid blast crisis in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia : effect of estradiol on growth and differentiation in vitro .
Evolution of a case of chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) into blast crisis was found to be characterized by three unusual features ( 1 ) the phenotype of the emerging blast cells was that of pre-plasmacytoid cells as shown by plasma cell morphology and an immunological phenotype corresponding partially with CLL- or intermediate B-cells , partially with plasma cells ( terminal:__entity__ transferase:__entity__ - , common acute:__entity__ lymphocytic:__entity__ leukemia:__entity__ antigen:__entity__ - , Ia+:__entity__ , surface:__entity__ immunoglobulin:__entity__ heavy:__entity__ chains:__entity__ - , surface:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ light:__entity__ chains:__entity__ + , intracytoplasmic:__entity__ immunoglobulin:__entity__ A+:__entity__ and:__entity__ G+:__entity__ , BA-1+:__entity__ , polyclonal gammaglobulin production ) ; ( 2 ) cytogenetic analysis of spontaneous metaphases revealed that in addition to the typical CLL abnormality , trisomy 12 , in all of the cells , an additional translocation between chromosomes:__entity__ 14:__entity__ and:__entity__ 17:__entity__ was present in 40 % with a presumptive breakpoint on chromosome:__entity__ 14:__entity__ ( q12-3 ) never described before ( commonly q32 ) and ( 3 ) the progression of the disease was associated with a striking increase in the expression by the transformed cells of specific binding sites for estradiol ( E2 ) due to an actual increase in total cellular:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ and not to a change in receptor affinity for E2 .
The functional status of the steroid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ was confirmed by nuclear transfer of the cytoplasmic:__entity__ hormone-receptor:__entity__ complex:__entity__ upon temperature activation .
Since the rise in E2-receptor:__entity__ display paralleled a large increase in the proliferative activity of the cells as well as a change in their maturation status the question was raised as to whether the E2-receptor:__entity__ should be considered as a physiological marker of growth rate or of cellular differentiation .
Exposure of the patient 's blast cells to E2 in vitro resulted in cessation of cell growth following at least one mitosis after addition of the inducer as seen from the replacement of the large blasts by small CLL-like cells without definite signs of alteration of the differentiation status .
This suggests the association of E2-receptor:__entity__ expression with control of growth rather than cell maturation .
Multiple forms and fragments of cytosolic:__entity__ glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ from human leukemic cells and normal lymphocytes .
Therapy with glucocorticoids is generally more effective in acute lymphoblastic leukemia than in other types of human leukemia .
Previous studies , however , have not revealed any consistent relationship between clinical responsiveness and the cellular or cytosolic concentration of glucocorticoid-binding:__entity__ sites:__entity__ .
The objectives of this study were to determine whether there are intrinsic structural differences among the glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ in various types of leukemic cells and normal lymphocytes and to investigate the role of endogenous:__entity__ peptidases:__entity__ in receptor degradation .
Cytosols were prepared from fresh or rapidly frozen leukocytes from 6 healthy adults and 35 high-risk leukemia patients ( median white blood cell count , 150 , 000 cells/microliter ; median age , 13 years ) .
Receptors were labeled with [ 3H ] triamcinolone acetonide and quantitated by charcoal-dextran treatment or Sephadex LH-20 chromatography .
Mean and median cytosolic receptor concentrations in 12 acute lymphoblastic leukemia specimens lacking the standard B-cell or T-cell markers ( `` null cells '' ) were approximately 4-fold higher than in 23 other leukemic cell specimens .
No other consistent differences in receptor content were observed .
Agarose filtration and ultracentrifugation in hypotonic buffers containing 20 mM Na2MoO4 revealed complexes of similar size and shape in all clinical specimens tested and two established leukemic cell lines .
They had Stokes radii ( Rs ) of 8.1 +/- 0.5 ( S.D. ) nm ( n = 50 ) , sedimentation coefficients of 9.5 +/- 0.3S ( n = 40 ) , molecular weights of approximately 330 , 000 , and axial ratios ( a/b ) of approximately 12 .
In hypertonic , molybdate-free buffer , these oligomeric:__entity__ complexes:__entity__ were dissociated into subunits with Rs of 5.9 +/- 0.3 nm ( n = 12 ) and a/b of 11 to 12 , as observed previously for other receptors .
Fragmentation of the oligomer:__entity__ and the subunit:__entity__ was evident in some cytosols .
High activities of peptidases:__entity__ of various specificities were detected in leukemic cell cytosols , as in other cytosols , by fluorometric assays with derivatives of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin .
Receptor cleavage by these and other endogenous:__entity__ enzymes:__entity__ may account for previous observations of `` abnormal '' receptors in cytosols from some leukemic specimens .
We conclude that intrinsic structural defects in the receptors are unlikely explanations for the unresponsiveness of some types of leukemia to steroid therapy .
Glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ number and intracellular water space .
In order to elucidate the relationship between cell water content and number of glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ , eleven normal and malignant lymphoid or myelomonocytic cell types originating from mouse , rat and man were investigated .
The cellular water space was measured with 3H2O , and glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ number was measured in a whole-cell binding assay with [ 3H ] dexamethasone at 30 and 37 degrees C .
The intracellular water phase concentration of glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ ( around 40 nmol/l cell water ) , and the dependence of receptor affinity on temperature were similar in normal and malignant rodent and human cells .
It is concluded that comparisons of glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ levels are best made on the basis of intracellular:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ concentrations .
Covalent labeling of rat thymocyte and human:__entity__ lymphoid:__entity__ glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ .
Lymphoid cells contain specific receptors:__entity__ for glucocorticoids .
We have used [ 3H ] dexamethasone-21-mesylate to label covalently glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ in rat thymic lymphocytes and in neoplastic cells obtained from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and malignant lymphoma .
The covalently labeled glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ were identified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( in the presence of 0.1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ) .
In cytosolic fractions prepared from rat thymic lymphocytes , [ 3H ] -dexamethasone-21-mesylate labels a protein ( Mr approximately equal to 95 , 000 ) which was identified as the glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ by the following criteria : ( a ) labeling of this moiety is inhibited by treatment with a 100-fold molar excess of glucocorticoids , such as dexamethasone and triamcinolone acetonide ; and ( b ) the covalently labeled Mr approximately equal to 95 , 000 protein is activated ( by heating at 20 degrees for 30 min ) to a form that binds to DNA-cellulose .
When intact thymocytes are treated with [ 3H ] dexamethasone-21-mesylate , an Mr approximately equal to 95 , 000 moiety is also labeled covalently .
Approximately 35 % of the glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ can be labeled covalently when intact thymocytes are treated with 100 nM [ 3H ] dexamethasone-21-mesylate for 30 min at 4 degrees .
Neoplastic cells from acute lymphoblastic leukemia and malignant lymphoma were treated with [ 3H ] dexamethasone-21-mesylate .
In all samples , an Mr approximately equal to 95 , 000 moiety was labeled covalently ; labeling was inhibited by excess glucocorticoid .
Smaller:__entity__ moieties:__entity__ were also identified by competition experiments ; these may represent proteolytic:__entity__ fragments:__entity__ of the Mr approximately equal to 95 , 000 receptor .
Thus , in rat and human lymphoid cells , [ 3H ] dexamethasone-21-mesylate can be used to label covalently the glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ .
The association of cytosol oestrogen:__entity__ and:__entity__ progesterone:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ with histological features of breast cancer and early recurrence of disease .
Two hundred and eighty-eight primary breast tumours were examined for the presence or absence of oestrogen:__entity__ (:__entity__ REc:__entity__ ):__entity__ and:__entity__ progesterone:__entity__ (:__entity__ RPc:__entity__ ):__entity__ receptors:__entity__ .
Analysis has shown a relative interdependence between the steroid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ status of primary breast cancer and other prognostic variables such as histological grade , lymphocytic infiltration and tumour elastosis .
There were significant associations between epithelial cellularity , stromal fibrosis and the value of REc:__entity__ in those tumours in which the receptor was present .
Cellularity and fibrosis were unrelated to the presence or absence of oestrogen:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ .
By contrast , neither the presence or absence nor the value of RPc:__entity__ could be related to cellularity or fibrosis .
The value of REc:__entity__ and RPc:__entity__ analysis as an indicator of prognosis was examined in a sub-group of 175 patients receiving no additional treatment following mastectomy .
Overall relapse-free survival ( RFS ) was no different for those patients with receptors compared to those without them ( REc:__entity__ P = 0.11 , RPc P = 0.7 ) .
There was no difference in RFS of receptor positive and negative tumours when the axillary node status was taken into account .
Clinical implications of glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ in human leukemia .
Normal lymphoid cells contain glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ .
A variety of stimuli that activate these cells also induce increases in receptor concentration .
Similar glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ can be detected in lymphoid cells from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) .
Absence of the glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ ( usually found in treated patients ) predicts lack of glucocorticoid responsiveness .
Furthermore , in our hands , glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ levels correlate with the duration of complete remission in ALL ( though not in other forms of leukemia ) .
This association is independent of cell type , age , sex , or initial leukocyte count .
The level of receptor shows a negative correlation with increasing aggressiveness of the tumor ( null-cell leukemia greater than T-cell leukemia greater than Burkitt 's lymphoma ) .
Corticosteroid-mediated immunoregulation in man .
Glucocorticoids have profound and complex effects on the human immune response .
However , the precise mechanisms of the corticosteroid-induced immunoregulation in man have not been precisely defined .
Intracytoplasmic:__entity__ corticosteroid-specific:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ appear to be an important common pathway for steroid-induced changes , but variations of receptor parameters do not account for the multifaceted effects on the immune system .
Human circulating mononuclear cells redistribute out of the intravascular compartment following treatment with corticosteroids .
Although certain components at this redistribution phenomenon have been well-characterized , the importance of this compartmental cellular shift with respect to the mechanisms of corticosteroid-induced immunoregulation are less well-defined .
Recent observations that activated lymphocytes may be sensitive to the lytic effects of glucocorticoids suggest that under certain situations the elimination of selected subsets of cells may be a relevant mechanism of corticosteroid-mediated immunoregulation in man .
Corticosteroid-mediated effects on monocyte function may be an important mechanism of drug-induced immunoregulation in monocyte-dependent responses .
In some experimental conditions , corticosteroids inhibit Interleukin:__entity__ 1:__entity__ production by monocytes .
The immunoregulatory effects of corticosteroids on lymphocyte immune responses are complex .
In vitro corticosteroids appear to selectively affect early immunoregulatory events as opposed to altering an established response .
Multiple sites of steroid-induced modulations of human B cell responses have been defined .
Human lymphoid cell lines and glucocorticoids : II .
Whole cell and cytoplasmic binding properties of lymphoblastoid , leukaemia and lymphoma lines .
The glucocorticoid binding properties of 18 human lymphoid cell lines ( HLCL ) have been investigated .
The specificity of steroid binding was confirmed with various glucocorticoid agonists and antagonists .
A gradation in whole cell and cytoplasmic glucocorticoid binding capacity was observed in the different cell line types : lymphoblastoid greater than lymphoma greater than leukaemia .
The cytoplasmic:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ of leukaemia and lymphoblastoid lines appeared to contain both proteinaceous and phospholipid components .
Cytoplasmic:__entity__ steroid-receptor:__entity__ complexes:__entity__ exhibited a wide range of sedimentation coefficients ( 8.5-11.3S ) in low ionic strength buffer but there was no correlation with cell line type or glucocorticoid sensitivity .
Activation of these complexes by heat ( 37 degrees C ) or exposure to high ionic strength buffer ( 0.3 M NaCl ) induced nuclear binding of steroid but only complexes in high ionic strength buffer manifested changes in sedimentation coefficient .
No correlation was observed between the level or nature of glucocorticoid binding and the cytolethal or cytostatic responsiveness of HLCL to glucocorticoid treatment in vitro .
The resistance to cytolethal effects can not be ascribed to a failure of cells to take up and bind steroid or to significant differences in the molecular species of cytoplasmic:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ present .
The molecular mechanisms by which glucocorticoids achieve cytolethal responses in human lymphoid cells
CD28:__entity__ -mediated activation in CD45RA+ and CD45RO+ T cells : enhanced levels of reactive oxygen intermediates and c-Rel:__entity__ nuclear translocation in CD45RA+ cells .
We have analyzed the effect of complete T cell activation ( anti-CD3:__entity__ plus anti-CD28:__entity__ ) on the activation of NF-kappaB:__entity__ in CD45RA+ ( naive ) and CD45RO+ ( memory/effector ) T cells .
Long exposure ( 24 h ) induced stronger NF-kappaB:__entity__ DNA binding in CD45RA+ cells than in CD45RO+ cells .
Analysis of the nuclear:__entity__ c-Rel:__entity__ protein:__entity__ indicated that after anti-CD3+anti-CD28 stimulation the level of c-Rel:__entity__ was higher in CD45RA+ cells .
Analysis of the cytoplasmic inhibitor IkappaBalpha:__entity__ indicated that anti-CD3+anti-CD28 stimulation induced a long-lasting degradation in CD45RA+ cells but in CD45RO+ cells the degradation process was more rapid .
Because the CD28 costimulus is known to induce the production of reactive oxygen intermediates ( ROIs ) , the intracellular ROI levels in CD45RA+ and CD45RO+ cells were compared by flow cytometry .
ROIs were produced in both cell types , but more strongly in CD45RA+ cells .
The data presented in this study further emphasize the differences between CD45RA+ and CD45RO+ T lymphocytes in ROI-dependent signaling pathways .
Ikaros:__entity__ in hemopoietic lineage determination and homeostasis .
Studies on the molecular mechanisms that control hemopoietic differentiation have focused on signaling cascades and nuclear effectors that drive this complex developmental system in a regulated fashion .
Here we review the role of Ikaros:__entity__ , the founding member of a unique family of zinc:__entity__ finger:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ in this developmental process .
Studies on an Ikaros:__entity__ null mutation have revealed an essential role for this factor in lymphoid cell fate determination and at subsequent branch points of the T cell differentiation pathway .
Differences in the phenotypes of a null and a dominant negative ( DN ) Ikaros mutation provide insight into a regulatory network through which Ikaros:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ exert their effects in development .
In addition a comparative analysis of the hemopoietic stem cell and precursor compartment resulting from the two Ikaros:__entity__ mutations reveals a profound yet not absolute requirement for Ikaros:__entity__ in the production and differentiation of these populations .
Overexpression of p65 and c-Jun substitutes for B7-1 costimulation by targeting the CD28RE:__entity__ within the IL-2:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ .
The role of Rel:__entity__ and activation:__entity__ protein-1:__entity__ ( AP-1:__entity__ ) in IL-2:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ activity in B7-1- and leukocyte function-associated Ag-3 ( LFA. 3 ) -costimulated T cells has been evaluated .
We demonstrate that overexpression of c-Jun:__entity__ but not c-Fos:__entity__ increases IL-2:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ activity in both B7-1- and LFA-3-costimulated Jurkat T cells .
Cotransfection of both c-Jun and c-Fos substitutes for B7-1 costimulation in driving an activation:__entity__ protein-1:__entity__ response:__entity__ element:__entity__ but not for the IL-2:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ .
Overexpression of Rel:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ demonstrated that p65-expressing Jurkat cells transcribed equally well a nuclear:__entity__ factor:__entity__ kappabeta:__entity__ reporter:__entity__ construct:__entity__ when costimulated with B7-1:__entity__ or LFA-3:__entity__ , but transcription of IL-2:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ or CD28:__entity__ response:__entity__ element:__entity__ (:__entity__ CD28RE:__entity__ ):__entity__ -driven:__entity__ reporters:__entity__ was superior in B7-1-costimulated cells .
Combined expression of c-Jun:__entity__ and p65:__entity__ induced vigorous transcription of IL-2:__entity__ promoter-:__entity__ and:__entity__ CD28RE-driven:__entity__ reporter:__entity__ constructs:__entity__ in both LFA-3- and B7-1-costimulated Jurkat cells .
Mutating the CD28RE:__entity__ but not the upstream:__entity__ nuclear:__entity__ factor:__entity__ kappabeta-binding:__entity__ site:__entity__ in the IL-2:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ reduced B7-1:__entity__ -driven transcription > 90 % .
The results implicates a major role of the CD28RE:__entity__ in the integration of p65:__entity__ / c-Jun:__entity__ -mediated transcription within the IL-2:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ .
We suggest that the transition from an autocrine LFA-3:__entity__ -driven immune response to a B7 -- induced paracrine immune response involves the activation of c-Jun:__entity__ and p65:__entity__ , which target the CD28RE:__entity__ region of the IL-2:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ .
Defects in actin-cap formation in Vav-deficient mice implicate an actin requirement for lymphocyte signal transduction .
BACKGROUND : Antigen-receptor interactions on lymphocytes result in local clustering of actin:__entity__ , receptors and signaling molecules into an asymmetric membrane structure termed a cap .
Although actin polymerization is known to be required , the mechanisms underlying cap formation are unclear .
We have studied the events underlying cap formation using mice bearing a null mutation in vav:__entity__ ( vav:__entity__ -/- ) , a gene that encodes a guanine-nucleotide:__entity__ exchange:__entity__ factor:__entity__ for the GTPase:__entity__ Rac:__entity__ .
RESULTS : Lymphocytes from vav:__entity__ -/- mice failed to form T-cell receptor caps following activation and had a defective actin cytoskeleton .
The vav-/- T cells were deficient in interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) production and proliferation , and the peak of Ca2+ mobilization was reduced although of normal duration .
Activation of Jun:__entity__ N-terminal:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ or stress-activated:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ ( JNK:__entity__ or SAPK:__entity__ ) and mitogen-activated:__entity__ protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ ( MAPK:__entity__ ) and the induction of the transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ NF-ATc1:__entity__ and:__entity__ egr-1:__entity__ genes:__entity__ was normal .
Despite the reduced Ca2+ mobilization , translocation of cytoplasmic:__entity__ NF-ATc:__entity__ to the nucleus was normal , reflecting that the lower levels of Ca2+ in vav-/- cells were still sufficient to activate calcineurin:__entity__ .
Treatment of lymphocytes with cytochalasin D , which blocks actin polymerization , inhibited cap formation and produced defects in signaling and IL-2 transcriptional induction in response to antigen-receptor signaling that were nearly identical to those seen in vav-/- cells .
In transfection studies , either constitutively active Vav:__entity__ or Rac:__entity__ could complement constitutively active calcineurin:__entity__ to activate NF-AT-dependent transcription .
CONCLUSIONS : These results indicate that Vav:__entity__ is required for cap formation in lymphocytes .
Furthermore , the correlation between cap formation , IL-2 production and proliferation supports the hypothesis that an actin-dependent pathway is a source of specialized growth regulatory signals .
CD14:__entity__ -dependent activation of human endothelial cells by Bacteroides fragilis outer membrane .
We studied the capacity of isolated Bacteriodes fragilis outer membrane , B. fragilis NCTC9343 lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ; endotoxin ) , and B. fragilis NCTC9343 capsular polysaccharides to activate human umbilical vein endothelial cell ( HUVEC ) monolayers .
To assess HUVEC activation , E-selectin:__entity__ expression was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) , Northern blot analysis for E-selectin-specific:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ , and electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) for NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ , a transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ necessary for E-selectin:__entity__ gene:__entity__ activation .
Exposure of HUVECs to B. fragilis outer membrane fractions , separated from other components of the B. fragilis cell wall by isopycnic , sucrose gradient centrifugation , significantly increased surface expression of E-selectin:__entity__ and induced functional endothelial cell -dependent leukocyte adhesion .
B. fragilis outer membranes induced translocation of NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ to HUVEC nuclei and accumulation of E-selectin:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ in HUVEC cytoplasm .
E-selectin expression induced by B. fragilis outer membranes was not blocked by polymixin B .
In contrast , E-selectin expression induced by outer membrane fractions purified from E. coli was competitively inhibited by polymixin B .
Neither purified B. fragilis LPS , a prominent constituent of the outer membrane , nor purified B. fragilis capsular polysaccharides induced HUVEC activation .
Two different monoclonal:__entity__ antibodies:__entity__ directed against human:__entity__ CD14:__entity__ completely inhibited B. fragilis outer membrane-induced NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ activation , E-selectin transcription , and E-selectin surface expression .
We conclude that the outer membrane component of the B. fragilis cell wall contains a proinflammatory factor ( s ) , that is not LPS , which induces human endothelial cell activation by a soluble CD14:__entity__ -dependent mechanism .
NF-kappaB:__entity__ protects HIV-1-infected myeloid cells from apoptosis .
HIV-1 infection of primary monocytic cells and myeloid cell lines results in sustained NF-kappaB activation .
Recently , NF-kappaB induction has been shown to play a role in protecting cells from programmed cell death .
In the present study , we sought to investigate whether constitutive NF-kappaB:__entity__ activity in chronically HIV-1-infected promonocytic U937 ( U9-IIIB ) and myeloblastic PLB-985 ( PLB-IIIB ) cells affects apoptotic signaling .
TNFalpha:__entity__ and cycloheximide caused infected cells to undergo apoptosis more rapidly than parental U937 and PLB-985 cells .
Inhibition of TNFalpha:__entity__ -induced NF-kappaB activation using the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) resulted in increased apoptosis in both U937 and U9-IIIB cells , while preactivation of NF-kappaB:__entity__ with the non-apoptotic:__entity__ inducer:__entity__ IL-1beta:__entity__ caused a relative decrease in apoptosis .
Inhibition of constitutive NF-kappaB:__entity__ activity in U9-IIIB and PLB-IIIB cells also induced apoptosis , suggesting that NF-kappaB protects cells from a persistent apoptotic signal .
TNFalpha:__entity__ plus NAC treatment resulted in a marked decrease in Bcl-2:__entity__ protein:__entity__ levels in HIV-1-infected cells , coupled with an increase in Bax:__entity__ protein:__entity__ compared to uninfected cells , suggesting that the difference in susceptibility to TNFalpha:__entity__ -induced apoptosis may relate to the differences in relative levels of Bcl-2:__entity__ and Bax:__entity__ .
The protective role of NF-kappaB:__entity__ in blocking TNFalpha- and HIV-1-induced apoptosis was supported by studies in Jurkat T cells engineered to express IkappaB:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ repressor:__entity__ mutants:__entity__ ( TD-IkappaB:__entity__ ) under the control of a tetracycline-responsive:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ .
Cells underwent apoptosis in response to TNFalpha:__entity__ only when NF-kappaB activation was inhibited by TD-IkappaB:__entity__ expression .
As was observed for the U9-IIIB cells , TNFalpha:__entity__ treatment also induced a marked decrease in Bcl-2:__entity__ protein:__entity__ levels in TD-IkappaB expressing cells .
These experiments demonstrate that apoptotic signaling is perturbed in HIV-1-infected U9-IIIB cells and indicate that NF-kappaB activation may play an additional protective role against HIV-1-induced apoptosis in myeloid cells .
Human normal peripheral blood B-lymphocytes are deficient in DNA-dependent protein kinase activity due to the expression of a variant form of the Ku86:__entity__ protein:__entity__ .
The heterodimeric Ku:__entity__ protein:__entity__ , which comprises a 86:__entity__ kDa:__entity__ (:__entity__ Ku86:__entity__ ):__entity__ amd a 70:__entity__ kDa:__entity__ (:__entity__ Ku70:__entity__ ):__entity__ subunits:__entity__ , is an abundant nuclear:__entity__ DNA-binding:__entity__ protein:__entity__ which binds in vitro to DNA:__entity__ termini:__entity__ without sequence specificity .
Ku:__entity__ is the DNA-targeting:__entity__ component:__entity__ of the large catalytic:__entity__ sub-unit:__entity__ of the DNA-dependent:__entity__ protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ complex:__entity__ ( DNA-PK:__entity__ [:__entity__ CS:__entity__ ]:__entity__ ) , that plays a critical role in mammalian double-strand break repair and lymphoid V ( D ) J recombination .
By using electrophoretic mobility shift assays , we demonstrated that in addition to the major:__entity__ Ku:__entity__ x:__entity__ DNA:__entity__ complex:__entity__ usually detected in cell line extracts , a second complex with faster electrophoretic mobility was observed in normal peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBL ) extracts .
The presence of this faster:__entity__ migrating:__entity__ complex:__entity__ was restricted to B cells among the circulating lymphocyte population .
Western blot analysis revealed that B cells express a variant form of the Ku86:__entity__ protein:__entity__ with an apparent molecular weight of 69 kDa , and not the 86:__entity__ kDa-:__entity__ full-length:__entity__ protein:__entity__ .
Although the heterodimer:__entity__ Ku70/variant-Ku86:__entity__ binds to DNA-ends:__entity__ , this altered form of the Ku:__entity__ heterodimer:__entity__ has a decreased ability to recruit the catalytic:__entity__ component:__entity__ of the complex , DNA-PK:__entity__ (:__entity__ CS:__entity__ ):__entity__ , which contributes to an absence of detectable DNA-PK activity in B cells .
These data provide a molecular basis for the increased sensitivity of B cells to ionizing radiation and identify a new mechanism of regulation of DNA-PK activity that operates in vivo .
Co-stimulation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells with IL-2:__entity__ and anti-CD3:__entity__ monoclonal:__entity__ antibodies:__entity__ induces phosphorylation of CREB:__entity__ .
Phosphorylation of the cAMP-response:__entity__ element:__entity__ binding:__entity__ protein:__entity__ CREB:__entity__ within 1 h of CD2:__entity__ but not CD3:__entity__ cross-linking of human PBMC was recently demonstrated .
The absence of P-CREB:__entity__ following CD3 cross-linking was unexpected , as other laboratories reported increased phosphorylation of CREB:__entity__ following CD3 cross-linking of the Jurkat lymphocyte cell line .
Due to Jurkat T-cells being IL-2-independent , it was postulated that IL-2:__entity__ might provide a necessary co-stimulus for phosphorylation of CREB:__entity__ in primary lymphocytes .
Therefore , P-CREB:__entity__ was evaluated following co-stimulation of human PBMC through the IL-2:__entity__ and:__entity__ CD2:__entity__ or:__entity__ CD3:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ .
IL-2:__entity__ did not further augment phosphorylation of CREB:__entity__ following CD2 cross-linking .
However , while neither IL-2:__entity__ nor CD3 cross-linking alone induced P-CREB:__entity__ , a 4.5-fold increase in phosphorylation of CREB:__entity__ within 1 h of IL-2/CD3 co-stimulation was observed .
Phosphorylation was not associated with the induction of cAMP , and inhibition of PKA signaling had no effect on P-CREB:__entity__ .
Consistent with signal transduction through p56lck:__entity__ or p59fyn:__entity__ , inhibition of PTK signaling reduced phosphorylation 50 % .
Interestingly , inhibiting PKC signaling with calphostin C further increased P-CREB levels 3-fold over that observed in IL-2/CD3 co-stimulated cells not pretreated with a PKC inhibitor .
In contrast to previous studies performed in the absence of exogenous:__entity__ IL-2:__entity__ , no increase in binding of CREB:__entity__ to a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe was observed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
These data suggest that the IL-2:__entity__ and CD3:__entity__ signaling pathways provide a necessary and co-operative stimulus promoting phosphorylation of CREB:__entity__ following receptor cross-linking .
HIV-1 infection induces a selective reduction in STAT5 protein expression .
HIV-1 infection is accompanied by qualitative and quantitative defects in CD4+ T lymphocytes .
Loss of immune function in HIV patients is usually associated with a profound dysregulation of cytokine:__entity__ production .
To investigate whether cytokine:__entity__ signaling defects occur during HIV infection , PHA blasts from healthy human donors were infected with two strains of HIV-1 and screened for the expression of STAT:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ used in cytokine:__entity__ signaling .
A selective decrease in STAT5B:__entity__ was seen 8 days after infection with the BZ167 dual-tropic HIV isolate , but not with the Ba-L , M-tropic strain .
Based on these findings , purified T cells from HIV-infected patients in different stages of disease were also tested for STAT expression ; decreases in STAT5A:__entity__ , STAT5B:__entity__ , and STAT1alpha:__entity__ were observed in all patients .
The reduction in STATs:__entity__ seen in vivo and in vitro after HIV infection may contribute to the loss of T cell function in HIV disease .
Transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ that regulate monocyte / macrophage differentiation .
Although all the cells in an organism contain the same genetic information , differences in the cell phenotype arise from the expression of lineage-specific:__entity__ genes:__entity__ .
During myelopoiesis , external differentiating signals regulate the expression of a set of transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ .
The combined action of these transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ subsequently determines the expression of myeloid-specific:__entity__ genes:__entity__ and the generation of monocytes and macrophages .
In particular , the transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ PU.1:__entity__ has a critical role in this process .
We review the contribution of several transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ to the control of macrophage development
Transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ LKLF:__entity__ is sufficient to program T cell quiescence via a c-Myc -- dependent pathway .
T lymphocytes circulate in a quiescent state until they encounter cognate:__entity__ antigen:__entity__ bound to the surface of an antigen-presenting cell .
The molecular pathways that regulate T cell quiescence remain largely unknown .
Here we show that forced expression of the lung:__entity__ Kruppel-like:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ ( LKLF:__entity__ ) in Jurkat T cells is sufficient to program a quiescent phenotype characterized by decreased proliferation , reduced cell size and protein synthesis and decreased surface expression of activation markers .
Conversely , LKLF-deficient peripheral T cells produced by gene targeting showed increased proliferation , increased cell size and enhanced expression of surface activation markers in vivo .
LKLF:__entity__ appeared to function , at least in part , by decreasing expression of the proto-oncogene:__entity__ encoding c-Myc:__entity__ .
Forced expression of LKLF:__entity__ was associated with markedly decreased c-Myc:__entity__ expression .
In addition , many effects of LKLF:__entity__ expression were mimicked by expression of the dominant-negative:__entity__ MadMyc:__entity__ protein:__entity__ and rescued by overexpression of c-Myc:__entity__ .
Thus , LKLF:__entity__ is both necessary and sufficient to program quiescence in T cells and functions , in part , by negatively regulating a c-Myc -- dependent pathway .
HTLV-1:__entity__ p12:__entity__ (:__entity__ I:__entity__ ):__entity__ protein:__entity__ enhances STAT5 activation and decreases the interleukin-2:__entity__ requirement for proliferation of primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells .
The p12:__entity__ (:__entity__ I:__entity__ ):__entity__ protein:__entity__ , encoded by the pX:__entity__ open:__entity__ reading:__entity__ frame:__entity__ I:__entity__ of the human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) , is a hydrophobic:__entity__ protein:__entity__ that localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi .
Although p12:__entity__ (:__entity__ I:__entity__ ):__entity__ contains 4 minimal proline-rich , src:__entity__ homology:__entity__ 3-binding:__entity__ motifs:__entity__ ( PXXP:__entity__ ) , a characteristic commonly found in proteins involved in signaling pathways , it has not been known whether p12:__entity__ (:__entity__ I:__entity__ ):__entity__ has a role in modulating intracellular signaling pathways .
This study demonstrated that p12:__entity__ (:__entity__ I:__entity__ ):__entity__ binds to the cytoplasmic:__entity__ domain:__entity__ of the interleukin-2:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ (:__entity__ IL-2R:__entity__ ):__entity__ beta:__entity__ chain:__entity__ that is involved in the recruitment of the Jak1:__entity__ and:__entity__ Jak3:__entity__ kinases:__entity__ .
As a result of this interaction , p12:__entity__ (:__entity__ I:__entity__ ):__entity__ increases signal:__entity__ transducers:__entity__ and:__entity__ activators:__entity__ of:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ 5:__entity__ ( STAT5:__entity__ ) DNA binding and transcriptional activity and this effect depends on the presence of both IL-2R:__entity__ beta:__entity__ and:__entity__ gamma:__entity__ (:__entity__ c:__entity__ ):__entity__ chains:__entity__ and Jak3:__entity__ .
Transduction of primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) with a human:__entity__ immunodeficiency:__entity__ virus:__entity__ type:__entity__ 1-based:__entity__ retroviral:__entity__ vector:__entity__ expressing p12:__entity__ (:__entity__ I:__entity__ ):__entity__ also resulted in increased STAT5:__entity__ phosphorylation and DNA binding .
However , p12:__entity__ (:__entity__ I:__entity__ ):__entity__ could increase proliferation of human PBMCs only after stimulation of T-cell:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ by treatment of cells with low concentrations of alphaCD3:__entity__ and:__entity__ alphaCD28:__entity__ antibodies:__entity__ .
In addition , the proliferative advantage of p12 ( I ) -transduced PBMCs was evident mainly at low concentrations of IL-2:__entity__ .
Together , these data indicate that p12:__entity__ (:__entity__ I:__entity__ ):__entity__ may confer a proliferative advantage on HTLV-1-infected cells in the presence of suboptimal antigen stimulation and that this event may account for the clonal proliferation of infected T cells in vivo .

Single dose intranasal administration of retinal:__entity__ autoantigen:__entity__ generates a rapid accumulation and cell activation in draining lymph node and spleen : implications for tolerance therapy .
BACKGROUND/AIMS : A single intranasal delivery of retinal:__entity__ autoantigen:__entity__ suppresses effectively experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis ( EAU ) .
To further unravel underlying mechanisms the authors wished to determine , firstly , the kinetics of antigen delivery and , secondly , the early cellular responses involved in the initial stages of nasal mucosal tolerance induction .
METHODS : Flow cytometry , cell proliferation assays , and microscopy were used to track antigen:__entity__ following a single , intranasal dose of Alexa-488:__entity__ labelled:__entity__ retinal:__entity__ antigen:__entity__ .
RESULTS : A rapid accumulation of antigen:__entity__ within both superficial cervical lymph nodes ( SCLN ) and spleen was observed after 30 minutes .
Significant proliferative responses to IRBP were elicited by 48 hours indicating that systemic priming of naive T cells to retinal:__entity__ antigen:__entity__ had occurred .
Cell activation was further confirmed by immunoprecipitation studies , which demonstrated phosphorylation of STAT4:__entity__ but not STAT6:__entity__ in both lymph nodes and spleen .
However , at 24 hours , STAT4 heterodimerisation with STAT:__entity__ 3:__entity__ was only observed in spleen .
CONCLUSIONS : The results provide novel evidence that following a single intranasal application rapid transfer of antigen:__entity__ occurs .
Resulting T cell proliferation develops consequent to differential cell signalling in SCLN and spleen .
Further understanding of these underlying cellular mechanisms , in particular as is inferred by the results the contribution of local versus systemic tolerance induction , may assist in strategies to clinically apply mucosal tolerance therapy successfully .
Regulation of interleukin:__entity__ (:__entity__ IL:__entity__ ):__entity__ -18:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ chain:__entity__ expression on CD4 ( + ) T cells during T helper ( Th ) 1/Th2 differentiation .
Critical downregulatory role of IL-4:__entity__ .
Interleukin:__entity__ (:__entity__ IL:__entity__ ):__entity__ -18:__entity__ has been well characterized as a costimulatory:__entity__ factor:__entity__ for the induction of IL-12-mediated:__entity__ interferon:__entity__ (:__entity__ IFN:__entity__ ):__entity__ -gamma:__entity__ production by T helper ( Th ) 1 cells , but also can induce IL-4 production and thus facilitate the differentiation of Th2 cells .
To determine the mechanisms by which IL-18:__entity__ might regulate these diametrically distinct immune responses , we have analyzed the role of cytokines:__entity__ in the regulation of IL-18:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ chain:__entity__ ( IL-18Ralpha:__entity__ ) expression .
The majority of peripheral CD4 ( + ) T cells constitutively expressed the IL-18Ralpha:__entity__ .
Upon antigen stimulation in the presence of IL-12:__entity__ , marked enhancement of IL-18Ralpha:__entity__ expression was observed .
IL-12:__entity__ -mediated upregulation of IL-18Ralpha:__entity__ required IFN-gamma:__entity__ .
Activated CD4 ( + ) T cells that expressed low levels of IL-18Ralpha:__entity__ could produce IFN-gamma:__entity__ when stimulated with the combination of IL-12:__entity__ and IL-18:__entity__ , while CD4 ( + ) cells which expressed high levels of IL-18Ralpha:__entity__ could respond to IL-18:__entity__ alone .
In contrast , T cell stimulation in the presence of IL-4:__entity__ resulted in a downregulation of IL-18Ralpha:__entity__ expression .
Both IL-4 ( -/ ) - and signal transducer and activator of transcription ( Stat ) 6 ( -/ ) - T cells expressed higher levels of IL-18Ralpha:__entity__ after TCR stimulation .
Furthermore , activated T cells from Stat6 ( -/ ) - mice produced more IFN-gamma:__entity__ in response to IL-18:__entity__ than wild-type controls .
Thus , positive/negative regulation of the IL-18Ralpha:__entity__ by the major inductive cytokines:__entity__ ( IL-12:__entity__ and IL-4:__entity__ ) determines the capacity of IL-18:__entity__ to polarize an immune response .
Glucocorticoid-regulated:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ .
Glucocorticoids are the most effective antiinflammatory drugs used in the treatment of asthma .
They act by binding to a specific receptor ( GR:__entity__ ) that , upon activation , translocates to the nucleus and either increases ( transactivates ) or decreases ( transrepresses ) gene expression .
Inhibition of pro-inflammatory:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ such as activator:__entity__ protein:__entity__ (:__entity__ AP:__entity__ ):__entity__ -1:__entity__ , signal:__entity__ transducers:__entity__ and:__entity__ activators:__entity__ of:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ ( STATs:__entity__ ) , nuclear:__entity__ factor:__entity__ of:__entity__ activated:__entity__ T:__entity__ cells:__entity__ ( NFAT:__entity__ ) and nuclear:__entity__ factor:__entity__ (:__entity__ NF:__entity__ ):__entity__ -kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ is thought to be a major action of glucocorticoids .
Acetylation of histones:__entity__ allows unwinding of the local:__entity__ DNA:__entity__ structure:__entity__ and enables RNA:__entity__ polymerase:__entity__ II:__entity__ to enhance gene transcription .
Histone acetylation is regulated by a balance between the activity of histone:__entity__ acetyltransferases:__entity__ ( HATs:__entity__ ) and histone:__entity__ deacetylases:__entity__ ( HDACs:__entity__ ) .
GR:__entity__ acts as a direct inhibitor of NF-kappa B-induced HAT activity and also by recruiting HDAC2:__entity__ to the NF-kappa:__entity__ B/HAT:__entity__ complex:__entity__ .
A sub-group of patients with glucocorticoid-insensitive asthma have an inability to induce histone acetylation in response to dexamethasone suggesting reduced expression of a GR-specific:__entity__ HAT:__entity__ .
This suggests that pharmacological manipulation of specific histone acetylation status is a potentially useful approach for the treatment of inflammatory diseases .
Identification of the precise mechanism by which activated:__entity__ GR:__entity__ recruits HDAC2:__entity__ may reveal new targets for the development of drugs that may dissociate the antiinflammatory actions of glucocorticoids from their side effects that are largely due to gene induction .

Differential ultraviolet-B-induced immunomodulation in XPA , XPC , and CSB DNA repair-deficient mice .
Ultraviolet B irradiation has serious consequences for cellular immunity and can suppress the rejection of skin tumors and the resistance to infectious diseases .
DNA damage plays a crucial role in these immunomodulatory effects of ultraviolet B , as impaired repair of ultraviolet-B-induced DNA damage has been shown to cause suppression of cellular immunity .
Ultraviolet-B-induced DNA damage is repaired by the nucleotide excision repair mechanism very efficiently .
Nucleotide excision repair comprises two subpathways : transcription-coupled and global genome repair .
In this study the immunologic consequences of specific nucleotide excision repair defects in three mouse models , XPA , XPC , and CSB mutant mice , were investigated .
XPA mice carry a total nucleotide excision repair defect , whereas XPC and CSB mice only lack global genome and transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair , respectively .
Our data demonstrate that cellular immune parameters in XPA , XPC , and CSB mice are normal compared with their wild-type ( control ) littermates .
This may indicate that the reported altered cellular responses in xeroderma pigmentosum patients are not constitutive but could be due to external factors , such as ultraviolet B .
Upon exposure to ultraviolet B , only XPA mice are very sensitive to ultraviolet-B-induced inhibition of Th1-mediated contact hypersensitivity responses and interferon-gamma:__entity__ production in skin draining lymph nodes .
Lipopolysaccharide-stimulated tumor:__entity__ necrosis:__entity__ factor:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ and interleukin-10:__entity__ production are significantly augmented in both XPA and CSB mice after ultraviolet B exposure .
Lymph node cell numbers were increased very significantly in XPA , mildly increased in CSB , and not in XPC mice .
In general XPC mice do not exhibit any indication of enhanced ultraviolet B susceptibility with regard to the immune parameters analyzed .
These data suggest that both global genome repair and transcription-coupled repair are needed to prevent immunomodulation by ultraviolet B , whereas transcription-coupled repair is the major DNA repair subpathway of nucleotide excision repair that prevents the acute ultraviolet-B-induced effects such as erythema .
Biomechanical strain induces class a scavenger:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ expression in human monocyte/macrophages and THP-1 cells : a potential mechanism of increased atherosclerosis in hypertension .
BACKGROUND : Although hypertension is an important risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis , the mechanisms for this interaction are incompletely described .
Previous studies have suggested that biomechanical strain regulates macrophage phenotype .
We tested the hypothesis that biomechanical strain can induce expression of the class:__entity__ A:__entity__ scavenger:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ ( SRA:__entity__ ) , an important lipoprotein:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ in atherogenesis .
METHODS AND RESULTS : Human monocyte/macrophages or THP-1 cells were cultured in a device that imposes uniform biaxial cyclic 1-Hz strains of 0 % , 1 % , 2 % , or 3 % , and SRA:__entity__ expression was analyzed .
Mechanical strains induced SRA:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ ( 3.5+/-0.6-fold at 3 % strain for 48 hours , P < 0.01 ) and SRA:__entity__ protein:__entity__ in THP-1 cells in an amplitude-dependent manner .
This induction was accompanied by augmented expression of the class:__entity__ B:__entity__ scavenger:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ CD36:__entity__ ( 2.8+/-0.3-fold , P < 0.001 ) but not by increased peroxisome:__entity__ proliferator-activated:__entity__ receptor-gamma:__entity__ expression .
To evaluate this effect in vivo , apolipoprotein E ( -/- ) mice were randomly assigned to receive standard chow , a high-cholesterol diet , or a high-cholesterol diet with hypertension induced by angiotensin II infusion for 8 weeks .
Immunohistochemistry revealed that among macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions of the aorta , the proportion of macrophages with SRA:__entity__ expression was highest in hypertensive animals on a high-cholesterol diet ( 43.9+/-0.7 % , versus 12.0+/-2.0 % for normotensive animals on a high-cholesterol diet and 4.7+/-4.7 % for animals on standard chow ; P < 0.001 ) .
CONCLUSIONS : Biomechanical strain induces SRA:__entity__ expression by monocyte/macrophages , suggesting a novel mechanism for promotion of atherosclerosis in hypertensive patients .
High glucose induces MCP-1 expression partly via tyrosine kinase-AP-1 pathway in peritoneal mesothelial cells .
BACKGROUND : High glucose in peritoneal dialysis solutions has been implicated in the pathogenesis of peritoneal fibrosis in chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis ( CAPD ) patients .
However , the mechanisms are not very clear .
Peritoneal macrophages seem to participate in the process of peritoneal fibrosis and monocyte:__entity__ chemoattractant:__entity__ protein-1:__entity__ ( MCP-1:__entity__ ) plays a key role in the recruitment of monocytes toward the peritoneal cavity .
However , little is known about the effect of high glucose on MCP-1:__entity__ expression and its signal transduction pathway in human peritoneal mesothelial cells .
METHODS : Mesothelial cells were cultured with glucose ( 5 to 100 mmol/L ) or mannitol chronically for up to seven days .
MCP-1:__entity__ expression of mRNA and protein was measured by Northern blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) .
Chemotactic activity of high-glucose-conditioned culture supernatant was measured by chemotactic assay .
To examine the roles of the transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ activator:__entity__ protein-1:__entity__ ( AP-1:__entity__ ) and nuclear:__entity__ factor-kappaB:__entity__ ( NF-kappaB:__entity__ ) , electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) was performed .
RESULTS : Glucose induced MCP-1:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner .
MCP-1:__entity__ protein:__entity__ in cell culture supernant was also increased .
Equivalent concentrations of mannitol had no significant effect .
High-glucose-conditioned supernatant possessed an increased chemotactic activity for monocytes , which was neutralized by anti-MCP-1:__entity__ antibody:__entity__ .
EMSA revealed that glucose increased the AP-1:__entity__ binding activity in a time- and dose-dependent manner , but not NF-kappaB:__entity__ .
Curcumin , an inhibitor of AP-1:__entity__ , dose-dependently suppressed the induction of MCP-1:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ by high glucose .
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as genistein ( 12.5 to 50 micromol/L ) and herbimycin A ( 0.1 to 1 micromol/L ) inhibited the high-glucose-induced MCP-1:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ expression in a dose-dependent manner , and also suppressed the high-glucose-induced AP-1:__entity__ binding activity .
CONCLUSIONS : : High glucose induced mesothelial MCP-1:__entity__ expression partly via the tyrosine kinase- AP-1:__entity__ pathway .
Signal thresholds and modular synergy during expression of costimulatory molecules in B lymphocytes .
We analyzed intracellular pathways modulating surface densities of CD80:__entity__ and CD86:__entity__ in B cells activated through ligation of the Ag:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ , and the adhesion:__entity__ molecule:__entity__ CD54:__entity__ .
Whereas B:__entity__ cell:__entity__ Ag:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ ( BCR:__entity__ ) cross-linking alone stimulated increased expression of CD86:__entity__ , up-regulation of CD80:__entity__ required dual stimulation with anti-IgM:__entity__ and anti-CD54:__entity__ .
The principal downstream component contributed by BCR:__entity__ signaling , toward both CD80:__entity__ and CD86:__entity__ induction , was the elevated concentration of free cytoplasmic Ca ( 2+ ) , recruited by way of capacitative influx .
This alone was sufficient to generate an increase in CD86:__entity__ levels .
However , CD80:__entity__ enhancement required the concerted action of both intracellular Ca ( 2+ ) concentration and CD54-initiated pathways .
The nexus between anti-IgM and anti-CD54 stimulation , in the context of CD80:__entity__ regulation , was identified to involve a self-propagating process of sequential synergy .
The first step involved amplified accumulation of intracellular cAMP , as a result of cross-talk between BCR:__entity__ -mobilized Ca ( 2+ ) and CD54-derived signals .
This then facilitated a second synergistic interaction between Ca ( 2+ ) and cAMP , culminating in CD80:__entity__ expression .
Our findings of distinct signal transducer requirements , with the added consequences of cross-talk , offers an explanation for variable modulation of costimulatory molecule expression in response to diverse physiological stimuli .
Importantly , these results also reveal how concentration threshold barriers for recruitment of individual second messengers can be overcome by constructive convergence of signaling modules .
The role of Epstein-Barr virus in neoplastic transformation .
In this review , we focus on new data from basic , translational and clinical research relating to the Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) .
Beside its well-known tropism for B lymphocytes and epithelial cells , EBV also infects T lymphocytes , monocytes and granulocytes .
After primary infection , EBV persists throughout the life span in resting memory B cells , from where it is reactivated upon breakdown of cellular immunity .
In the process of neoplastic transformation , the EBV-encoded:__entity__ latent:__entity__ membrane:__entity__ protein:__entity__ 1:__entity__ (:__entity__ LMP1:__entity__ ):__entity__ oncogene:__entity__ represents the major driving force .
LMP1:__entity__ acts like a constitutively:__entity__ activated:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ of the tumor:__entity__ necrosis:__entity__ factor:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ family:__entity__ and allows the amplification or bypassing of physiological regulatory signals through direct and indirect interactions with proteins of the tumor:__entity__ necrosis:__entity__ factor:__entity__ receptor-associated:__entity__ factor:__entity__ (:__entity__ TRAF:__entity__ ):__entity__ family:__entity__ .
TRAF2:__entity__ -mediated NF-kappaB:__entity__ activation , AP-1:__entity__ induction and JAK3:__entity__ / STAT:__entity__ activation may result in sustained proliferation leading to lymphoma .
The ability of LMP1:__entity__ to suppress germinal center formation and its capacity to mediate its own transcriptional activation shed new light on the pathogenesis of EBV-associated latency type II lymphoproliferations like Hodgkin 's disease and angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy .
The carboxy:__entity__ terminus:__entity__ of LMP1:__entity__ is also a reliable marker for individual EBV strain identification and thus offers new possibilities in tracing the molecular events leading to posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders ( PTLDs ) .
Cytotoxic T lymphocytes directed against well-characterized epitopes of EBV:__entity__ latency:__entity__ genes:__entity__ represent an already successful and promising therapeutic approach to EBV-associated lymphomas , in particular PTLDs
Interferon-alpha:__entity__ drives T cell-mediated immunopathology in the intestine .
The ability of interferon:__entity__ (:__entity__ IFN:__entity__ ):__entity__ -alpha:__entity__ to induce autoimmunity and exacerbate Th1 diseases is well known .
We have recently described enhanced expression of IFN-alpha:__entity__ in the mucosa of patients with celiac disease ( CD ) , a gluten-sensitive Th1-mediated enteropathy , characterized by villous atrophy and crypt cell hyperplasia .
Previous studies from this laboratory have shown that T cell activation in explant cultures of human fetal gut can also result in villous atrophy and crypt cell hyperplasia .
We have , therefore , examined changes that take place in explant cultures of human fetal gut after activation of T cells with anti-CD3:__entity__ and/or IFN-alpha:__entity__ .
We show that activation of T cells with anti-CD3:__entity__ alone elicits a small IFN-gamma:__entity__ and TNF-alpha:__entity__ response with no tissue injury .
Similarly , no changes are seen in explants cultured with IFN-alpha:__entity__ alone .
However , addition of IFN-alpha:__entity__ with anti-CD3:__entity__ results in enhanced Th1 response and crypt cell hyperplasia .
This is associated with enhanced phosphorylation of STAT1:__entity__ , STAT3:__entity__ , and Fyn:__entity__ ,:__entity__ a:__entity__ Src:__entity__ homology:__entity__ tyrosine:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ , which interacts with both TCR and IFN-alpha signal components .
Together these data indicate that IFN-alpha:__entity__ can facilitate activation of Th1-reactive cells in the gut and drive immunopathology .
Suppression of tumor:__entity__ necrosis:__entity__ factor:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ production by cAMP in human monocytes : dissociation with mRNA level and independent of interleukin-10:__entity__ .
BACKGROUND : Elevation of cellular cAMP inhibits lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -stimulated tumor:__entity__ necrosis:__entity__ factor:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ ( TNF-alpha:__entity__ ) production and increases the expression of interleukin:__entity__ (:__entity__ IL:__entity__ ):__entity__ -10:__entity__ in mononuclear cells .
TNF-alpha:__entity__ gene:__entity__ expression obligates activation of the transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ nuclear:__entity__ factor:__entity__ kappaB:__entity__ ( NF-kappaB:__entity__ ) .
Exogenous IL-10:__entity__ inhibits NF-kappaB:__entity__ in monocytes and thus attenuates TNF-alpha:__entity__ production .
We examined the role of endogenous IL-10:__entity__ in the regulation of NF-kappaB:__entity__ activation and TNF-alpha:__entity__ production in human monocytes by cAMP .
METHODS : Human monocytes were stimulated with Escherichia coli LPS ( 100 ng/ml ) with and without forskolin ( FSK , 50 microM ) or dibutyryl cyclic AMP ( dbcAMP , 100 microM ) .
Cytokine:__entity__ ( TNF-alpha:__entity__ and IL-10:__entity__ ) release was measured by immunoassay .
TNF-alpha:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ was measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction , and NF-kappaB:__entity__ DNA binding activity was assessed by gel mobility shift assay .
RESULTS : cAMP-elevating agents inhibited LPS-stimulated TNF-alpha:__entity__ release ( 0.77 +/- 0.13 ng/10 ( 6 ) cells in LPS + dbcAMP and 0.68 +/- 0.19 ng/10 ( 6 ) cells in LPS + FSK , both P < 0.05 vs 1.61 +/- 0.34 ng/10 ( 6 ) cells in LPS alone ) .
Conversely , cAMP enhanced LPS-stimulated IL-10:__entity__ release ( 100 +/- 21.5 pg/10 ( 6 ) cells in LPS + dbcAMP and 110 +/- 25.2 pg/10 ( 6 ) cells in LPS + FSK , both P < 0.05 vs 53.3 +/- 12.8 pg/10 ( 6 ) cells in LPS alone ) .
Neither TNF-alpha:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ expression nor NF-kappaB:__entity__ activation stimulated by LPS was inhibited by the cAMP-elevating agents .
Neutralization of IL-10:__entity__ with a specific antibody:__entity__ did not attenuate the effect of cAMP-elevating agents on TNF-alpha:__entity__ production .
CONCLUSION : The results indicate that cAMP inhibits LPS-stimulated TNF-alpha:__entity__ production through a posttranscriptional mechanism that is independent of endogenous IL-10:__entity__ .

Activation of the p21:__entity__ (:__entity__ CIP1/WAF1:__entity__ ):__entity__ promoter:__entity__ by bone:__entity__ morphogenetic:__entity__ protein-2:__entity__ in mouse B lineage cells .
BMPs:__entity__ exert a negative growth effect on various types of cells .
We have previously reported that BMP-2:__entity__ inhibited the growth of HS-72 mouse hybridoma cells by inducing p21 ( CIP1/WAF1 ) expression .
In the present study , we demonstrated that BMP-2:__entity__ activated the mouse p21:__entity__ (:__entity__ CIP1/WAF1:__entity__ ):__entity__ promoter:__entity__ in HS-72 cells , and that a 29-base:__entity__ pair:__entity__ (:__entity__ b:__entity__ ):__entity__ region:__entity__ of the promoter ( -1928/-1900 relative to the TATA:__entity__ box:__entity__ ) , conserved between mice and humans , was responsive to BMP-2:__entity__ as well as expression of Smad1:__entity__ , Smad4:__entity__ , and constitutively active mutants of BMP:__entity__ type:__entity__ I:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ .
Furthermore , an oligonucleotide containing the 29-b:__entity__ region:__entity__ was found to be associated with Smad4:__entity__ and phosphorylated:__entity__ Smad1:__entity__ in the nuclear extract of BMP-2:__entity__ -stimulated HS-72 cells .
These results suggested that BMP-2:__entity__ might activate p21 ( CIP1/WAF1 ) transcription by inducing a binding of Smad4:__entity__ and Smad1:__entity__ to the 29-b:__entity__ region:__entity__ in HS-72 cells .
Dendritic cell development from common myeloid progenitors .
Dendritic cells ( DCs ) are professional antigen-presenting cells which both initiate adaptive immune responses and control tolerance to self-antigens:__entity__ .
It has been suggested that these different effects on responder cells depend on subsets of DCs arising from either myeloid or lymphoid hematopoietic origins .
In this model , CD8 alpha+ Mac-1- DCs are supposed to be of lymphoid while CD8 alpha- Mac-1+ DCs are supposed to be of myeloid origin .
Here we summarize our findings that both CD8 alpha+ and CD8 alpha- DCs can arise from clonogenic common myeloid progenitors ( CMPs ) in both thymus and spleen .
Therefore CD8:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ expression DCs does not indicate a lymphoid origin and differences among CD8 alpha+ and CD8 alpha- DCs might rather reflect maturation status than ontogeny .
On the basis of transplantation studies , it seems likely that most of the DCs in secondary lymphoid organs and a substantial fraction of thymic DCs are myeloid-derived .
Macrophage stimulation with Murabutide , an HIV-suppressive muramyl peptide derivative , selectively activates extracellular:__entity__ signal-regulated:__entity__ kinases:__entity__ 1:__entity__ and:__entity__ 2:__entity__ , C/EBPbeta:__entity__ and STAT1:__entity__ : role of CD14:__entity__ and Toll-like:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ 2:__entity__ and:__entity__ 4:__entity__ .
The smallest unit of bacterial peptidoglycans known to be endowed with biological activities is muramyl dipeptide ( MDP ) .
A clinically acceptable synthetic derivative of MDP , namely murabutide ( MB ) , has been found to present interesting pharmacological properties and to suppress HIV-1 replication in monocyte-derived macrophages ( MDM ) .
We have addressed the signaling events activated in MDM following stimulation with either MB or the potent immunostimulant LPS .
We also examined whether signaling by muramyl peptides involves the use of cell:__entity__ surface:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ , including CD14:__entity__ and Toll-like:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ 2:__entity__ ( TLR2:__entity__ ) or TLR4:__entity__ that are known to be signal-transducing:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ for other bacterial cell wall components .
We demonstrate that , unlike LPS , the safe immunomodulator MB selectively activates extracellular:__entity__ signal-regulated:__entity__ kinases:__entity__ (:__entity__ Erk:__entity__ ):__entity__ 1/2:__entity__ , in the absence of detectable Jun:__entity__ N-terminal:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ ( JNK:__entity__ ) or p38:__entity__ mitogen-activated:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ activation .
Furthermore , STAT1:__entity__ activation but weak or no activation of STAT3:__entity__ or STAT5:__entity__ respectively , could be detected in MB-stimulated MDM .
Using MonoMac6 cells , we observed high C/EBPbeta:__entity__ and AP-1:__entity__ but weaker and transient NF-kappaB:__entity__ activation by MB .
Moreover , the truncated form of C/EBPbeta:__entity__ , known to repress HIV-1 transcription , was detected in extracts from MB-treated THP-1 cells .
Surprisingly , neither MB nor MDP were able to transduce signals via CD14:__entity__ and TLR2:__entity__ or:__entity__ 4:__entity__ .
These findings present major differences in the early cell activation process between LPS and muramyl peptides , and strongly argue for the implication of co-receptors:__entity__ other than TLR2:__entity__ and TLR4:__entity__ in mediating the signaling events induced by defined subunits of bacterial peptidoglycans .
Nuclear:__entity__ peroxisome:__entity__ proliferator-activated:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ and:__entity__ gamma:__entity__ have opposing effects on monocyte chemotaxis in endometriosis .
The peroxisome:__entity__ proliferator-activated:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ (:__entity__ PPARs:__entity__ ):__entity__ alpha:__entity__ and:__entity__ gamma:__entity__ are nuclear:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ that play important roles in inflammatory diseases like ulcerative colitis and arthritis .
In this study , we examined the possible role of PPARs:__entity__ in macrophage attraction into the peritoneal cavity of patients with endometriosis .
We identified PPAR-alpha:__entity__ and:__entity__ -gamma:__entity__ messenger RNA by RT-PCR and protein by immunoblotting of lysates of peritoneal macrophages and monocytic U937 cells .
Using immunocytochemistry , we localized PPAR-alpha:__entity__ and:__entity__ -gamma:__entity__ within the nuclei of both cell types .
Monocyte chemotactic activity of peritoneal fluid from patients with endometriosis was quantified in Boyden chambers .
Migration of U937 cells was increased by WY 14643 and reduced by rosiglitazone .
Peritoneal fluid from patients with endometriosis activated U937 cells transiently transfected with a PPAR-alpha/GAL4:__entity__ luciferase:__entity__ reporter:__entity__ .
By contrast , peritoneal fluid did not cause significant activation of PPAR-gamma/GAL4:__entity__ constructs:__entity__ .
The U937 cells transiently transfected with a PPAR:__entity__ response:__entity__ element:__entity__ luciferase:__entity__ reporter:__entity__ showed disease stage-dependent up-regulation when treated with peritoneal fluid from patients with endometriosis .
Treatment with peritoneal fluid from healthy controls down-regulated PPAR response element transactivation .
We conclude that peritoneal fluid of endometriosis patients contains activators of PPAR-alpha:__entity__ that stimulate macrophage chemotaxis .
Inhibitors of PPAR-alpha:__entity__ or activators of PPAR-gamma:__entity__ could be developed for the treatment of inflammation associated with endometriosis .
Long-term-impaired expression of nuclear:__entity__ factor-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ and I:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of trauma patients .
Nuclear:__entity__ factor:__entity__ (:__entity__ NF:__entity__ ):__entity__ -kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ expression and dimer characteristics were studied in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) of major-trauma patients and healthy controls .
Analysis of PBMCs on days 1 , 3 , 5 , and 10 after trauma revealed that expression of both p65p50:__entity__ heterodimers:__entity__ and p50p50:__entity__ homodimers:__entity__ was significantly reduced compared with that in controls .
In vitro lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) stimulation of PBMCs induced NF-kappa B translocation .
However , throughout the survey , p65p50 activation remained significantly lower in trauma patients than in controls .
After LPS stimulation in vitro , the p65p50/p50p50 ratio was significantly lower in PBMCs from trauma patients than from healthy controls .
The ex vivo expression of I:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ was higher in PBMCs of controls than of trauma patients .
LPS did not induce I kappa B expression in PBMCs from trauma patients , but strong induction was obtained with staphylococci , suggesting that this defect is not universal and depends on the nature of the activating signal .
Although no direct correlation was found between levels of interleukin-10:__entity__ or transforming:__entity__ growth:__entity__ factor-beta:__entity__ and NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ , these immunosuppressive:__entity__ cytokines:__entity__ were significantly elevated in trauma patients by 10 days after admission .
The long-term low-basal and LPS-induced nuclear translocation of NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ recalled long-term immunoparalysis observed in patients with severe inflammatory stress such as trauma .
Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury .
BACKGROUND : The morbidity associated with liver transplantation and major hepatic resections is partly a result of ischemia-reperfusion injury .
DATA SOURCES : The entire world literature on the subject was searched via Medline .
Keywords included reperfusion injury , transplantation , liver resection , nitric oxide , endothelin , cytokines:__entity__ , Kupffer cells , ischemic/ischaemic preconditioning , and nuclear:__entity__ factor-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ .
CONCLUSIONS : An imbalance between endothelin and nitric oxide levels results in failure of the hepatic microcirculation at the onset of reperfusion .
Activation of nuclear:__entity__ factor-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ in the liver promotes proinflammatory:__entity__ cytokine:__entity__ and adhesion:__entity__ molecule:__entity__ synthesis .
These result in oxygen-derived free radical production and neutrophil recruitment , further contributing to cellular injury .
Various therapeutic modalities acting on the above mediators have been successfully used to attenuate reperfusion injury in animal models of hepatic transplantation and resection .
Application of the knowledge gained from animal models of hepatic ischemia-reperfusion to the clinical setting will improve the outcome of hepatic surgery .
Down-regulation of IL-12:__entity__ p40:__entity__ gene:__entity__ in Plasmodium berghei-infected mice .
We analyzed the mechanism that causes suppression of IL-12:__entity__ p40:__entity__ gene:__entity__ induction during Plasmodium berghei infection .
Although IL-12:__entity__ together with IFN-gamma:__entity__ plays an important role in protection against pathogenic infection , the IL-12:__entity__ p70:__entity__ protein:__entity__ production of infected macrophages is lower than that by the uninfected macrophages .
We showed in the present study that the induction of IL-12:__entity__ p40:__entity__ gene:__entity__ but not IL-12:__entity__ p35:__entity__ gene:__entity__ in macrophages of P. berghei-infected mice was profoundly inhibited .
The inhibition was induced by interaction with macrophages that had contacted with P. berghei-infected erythrocytes and was mediated by a soluble factor , IL-10:__entity__ .
There was comparable activation of NF-kappaB:__entity__ in uninfected and infected cells .
The induction of IFN-regulatory:__entity__ factor-1:__entity__ gene:__entity__ was comparable in transcription level in uninfected and infected cells , while the unidentified complex formation of IFN-regulatory:__entity__ factor-1:__entity__ was observed in infected cells .
Therefore , the inhibition of the IL-12:__entity__ p40:__entity__ gene:__entity__ induction appeared to be regulated at transcriptional regulation level of the gene .
The Friend:__entity__ of:__entity__ GATA:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ U-shaped , FOG-1:__entity__ , and FOG-2:__entity__ function as negative regulators of blood , heart , and eye development in Drosophila .
Friend:__entity__ of:__entity__ GATA:__entity__ (:__entity__ FOG:__entity__ ):__entity__ proteins:__entity__ regulate GATA factor-activated gene transcription .
During vertebrate hematopoiesis , FOG:__entity__ and:__entity__ GATA:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ cooperate to promote erythrocyte and megakaryocyte differentiation .
The Drosophila:__entity__ FOG:__entity__ homologue:__entity__ U-shaped:__entity__ ( Ush:__entity__ ) is expressed similarly in the blood cell anlage during embryogenesis .
During hematopoiesis , the acute myeloid leukemia 1 homologue Lozenge and Glial cells missing are required for the production of crystal cells and plasmatocytes , respectively .
However , additional factors have been predicted to control crystal cell proliferation .
In this report , we show that Ush:__entity__ is expressed in hemocyte precursors and plasmatocytes throughout embryogenesis and larval development , and the GATA:__entity__ factor:__entity__ Serpent:__entity__ is essential for Ush:__entity__ embryonic expression .
Furthermore , loss of ush function results in an overproduction of crystal cells , whereas forced expression of Ush:__entity__ reduces this cell population .
Murine:__entity__ FOG-1:__entity__ and:__entity__ FOG-2:__entity__ also can repress crystal cell production , but a mutant version of FOG-2:__entity__ lacking a conserved motif that binds the corepressor:__entity__ C-terminal:__entity__ binding:__entity__ protein:__entity__ fails to affect the cell lineage .
The GATA:__entity__ factor:__entity__ Pannier:__entity__ ( Pnr:__entity__ ) is required for eye and heart development in Drosophila .
When Ush:__entity__ , FOG-1:__entity__ , FOG-2:__entity__ , or mutant:__entity__ FOG-2:__entity__ is coexpressed with Pnr:__entity__ during these developmental processes , severe eye and heart phenotypes result , consistent with a conserved negative regulation of Pnr:__entity__ function .
These results indicate that the fly and mouse FOG:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ function similarly in three distinct cellular contexts in Drosophila , but may use different mechanisms to regulate genetic events in blood vs . cardial or eye cell lineages
The RING:__entity__ finger:__entity__ protein:__entity__ Siah-1:__entity__ regulates the level of the transcriptional:__entity__ coactivator:__entity__ OBF-1:__entity__ .
The transcriptional:__entity__ coactivator:__entity__ OBF-1:__entity__ , which interacts with Oct-1:__entity__ and Oct-2:__entity__ and the octamer:__entity__ site:__entity__ DNA:__entity__ , has been shown to be critical for development of a normal immune response and the formation of germinal centers in secondary lymphoid organs .
Here we have identified the RING:__entity__ finger:__entity__ protein:__entity__ Siah-1:__entity__ as a protein interacting specifically with OBF-1:__entity__ .
This interaction is mediated by the C-terminal:__entity__ part of Siah-1:__entity__ and by residues in the N-terminus:__entity__ of OBF-1:__entity__ , partly distinct from the residues required for formation of a complex with the Oct:__entity__ POU:__entity__ domains:__entity__ and the DNA .
Interaction between Siah-1:__entity__ and OBF-1:__entity__ leads to downregulation of OBF-1 protein level but not mRNA , and to a corresponding reduction in octamer site-dependent transcription activation .
Inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in B cells leads to elevated levels of OBF-1:__entity__ protein:__entity__ .
Furthermore , in immunized mice , OBF-1:__entity__ protein:__entity__ amounts are dramatically increased in primary activated B cells , without concomitant increase in OBF-1:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ .
These data suggest that Siah-1:__entity__ is part of a novel regulatory loop controlling the level of OBF-1:__entity__ protein:__entity__ in B cells .
The beta-catenin -- TCF-1 pathway ensures CD4 ( + ) CD8 ( + ) thymocyte survival .
The association of trans-acting:__entity__ T:__entity__ cell:__entity__ factors:__entity__ ( TCFs:__entity__ ) or lymphoid:__entity__ enhancer:__entity__ factor:__entity__ 1:__entity__ ( LEF-1:__entity__ ) with their coactivator beta-catenin mediates transient transcriptional responses to extracellular Wnt signals .
We show here that T cell maturation depends on the presence of the beta-catenin:__entity__ --:__entity__ binding:__entity__ domain:__entity__ in TCF-1:__entity__ .
This domain is necessary to mediate the survival of immature CD4 ( + ) CD8 ( + ) double-positive ( DP ) thymocytes .
Accelerated spontaneous thymocyte death in the absence of TCF-1:__entity__ correlates with aberrantly low expression of the anti-apoptotic:__entity__ protein:__entity__ Bcl-x:__entity__ (:__entity__ L:__entity__ ):__entity__ .
Increasing anti-apoptotic effectors in thymocytes by the use of a Bcl-2:__entity__ transgene:__entity__ rescued TCF-1-deficient DP thymocytes from apoptosis .
Thus , TCF-1:__entity__ , upon association with beta-catenin , transiently ensures the survival of immature T cells , which enables them to generate and edit T:__entity__ cell:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ (:__entity__ TCR:__entity__ ):__entity__ alpha:__entity__ chains:__entity__ and attempt TCR:__entity__ -mediated positive selection .
TRAIL/Apo2L:__entity__ ligand:__entity__ selectively induces apoptosis and overcomes drug resistance in multiple myeloma : therapeutic applications .
Multiple myeloma ( MM ) remains incurable and novel treatments are urgently needed .
Preclinical in vitro and in vivo evaluations were performed to assess the potential therapeutic applications of human recombinant tumor:__entity__ necrosis:__entity__ factor:__entity__ (:__entity__ TNF:__entity__ ):__entity__ -related:__entity__ apoptosis-inducing:__entity__ ligand/Apo2:__entity__ ligand:__entity__ ( TRAIL/Apo2L:__entity__ ) in MM .
TRAIL/Apo2L:__entity__ potently induced apoptosis of MM cells from patients and the majority of MM cell lines , including cells sensitive or resistant to dexamethasone ( Dex ) , doxorubicin ( Dox ) , melphalan , and mitoxantrone .
TRAIL/Apo2L:__entity__ also overcame the survival effect of interleukin:__entity__ 6:__entity__ on MM cells and did not affect the survival of peripheral blood and bone marrow mononuclear cells and purified B cells from healthy donors .
The status of the TRAIL:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ ( assessed by immunoblotting and flow cytometry ) could not predict TRAIL sensitivity of MM cells .
The anti-MM activity of TRAIL/Apo2L:__entity__ was confirmed in nu/xid/bg mice xenografted with human MM cells ; TRAIL:__entity__ ( 500 microg intraperitoneally daily for 14 days ) was well tolerated and significantly suppressed the growth of plasmacytomas .
Dox up-regulated the expression of the TRAIL:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ death:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ 5:__entity__ ( DR5:__entity__ ) and synergistically enhanced the effect of TRAIL:__entity__ not only against MM cells sensitive to , but also against those resistant to , Dex- or Dox-induced apoptosis .
Nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappaB inhibitors , such as SN50 ( a cell-permeable inhibitor of the nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB:__entity__ ) or the proteasome inhibitor PS-341 , enhanced the proapoptotic activity of TRAIL/Apo2L:__entity__ against TRAIL-sensitive MM cells , whereas SN50 reversed the TRAIL resistance of ARH-77 and IM-9 MM cells .
Importantly , normal B lymphocytes were not sensitized to TRAIL:__entity__ by either Dox , SN50 , or PS-341 .
These preclinical studies suggest that TRAIL/Apo2L:__entity__ can overcome conventional drug resistance and provide the basis for clinical trials of TRAIL:__entity__ -based treatment regimens to improve outcome in patients with MM .

CD28:__entity__ costimulation is required not only to induce IL-12:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ but also to render janus:__entity__ kinases/STAT4:__entity__ responsive to IL-12:__entity__ stimulation in TCR-triggered T cells .
The activation of resting T cells for the acquisition of various functions depends on whether CD28 costimulatory signals are provided upon T cell receptor stimulation .
Here , we investigated how CD28 costimulation functions to allow TCR:__entity__ -triggered resting T cells to acquire IL-12:__entity__ responsiveness .
When T cells are stimulated with low doses of anti-CD3:__entity__ mAb:__entity__ , CD28 costimulation was required for the optimal levels of IL-12:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ ( IL-12R:__entity__ ) expression .
However , stimulation of T cells with high doses of anti-CD3:__entity__ alone induced comparable levels of IL-12R:__entity__ expression to those induced upon CD28 costimulation .
Nevertheless , there was a substantial difference in IL-12:__entity__ responsiveness between these two groups of T cells : compared to anti-CD28-costimulated T cells , T cells that were not costimulated with anti-CD28:__entity__ exhibited decreased levels of Janus:__entity__ kinases:__entity__ ( JAK:__entity__ ) JAK2/TYK2:__entity__ and STAT4:__entity__ phosphorylation and IFN-y production following IL-12:__entity__ stimulation .
Importantly , STAT6 phosphorylation following IL-4 stimulation was not decreased in anti-CD28-uncostimulated T cells .
These resutls indicate that CD28 costimulation not only contributes to up-regulating IL-12R:__entity__ expression but is also required to render JAKs/STAT4:__entity__ responsive to IL-12:__entity__ stimulation .
Constitutively activated Akt-1:__entity__ is vital for the survival of human monocyte-differentiated macrophages .
Role of Mcl-1:__entity__ , independent of nuclear:__entity__ factor:__entity__ (:__entity__ NF:__entity__ ):__entity__ -kappaB:__entity__ , Bad:__entity__ , or caspase activation .
Recent data from mice deficient for phosphatase:__entity__ and tensin:__entity__ homologue:__entity__ deleted from chromosome:__entity__ 10:__entity__ or src:__entity__ homology:__entity__ 2:__entity__ domain-containing:__entity__ 5:__entity__ ':__entity__ inositol:__entity__ phosphatase:__entity__ , phosphatases:__entity__ that negatively regulate the phosphatidylinositol:__entity__ 3-kinase:__entity__ ( PI3K:__entity__ ) pathway , revealed an increased number of macrophages in these animals , suggesting an essential role for the PI3K:__entity__ pathway for macro-phage survival .
Here , we focused on the role of the PI3K-regulated:__entity__ serine/threonine:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ Akt-1:__entity__ in modulating macrophage survival .
Akt-1:__entity__ was constitutively activated in human macrophages and addition of the PI3K:__entity__ inhibitor , LY294002 , suppressed the activation of Akt-1:__entity__ and induced cell death .
Furthermore , suppression of Akt-1:__entity__ by inhibition of PI3K:__entity__ or a dominant:__entity__ negative:__entity__ (:__entity__ DN:__entity__ ):__entity__ Akt-1:__entity__ resulted in loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential , activation of caspases-9:__entity__ and:__entity__ -3:__entity__ , and DNA fragmentation .
The effects of PI3K:__entity__ inhibition were reversed by the ectopic expression of constitutively activated Akt-1:__entity__ or Bcl-x:__entity__ (:__entity__ L:__entity__ ):__entity__ .
Inhibition of PI3K:__entity__ /Akt-1 pathway either by LY294002 or DN:__entity__ Akt-1:__entity__ had no effect on the constitutive or inducible activation of nuclear:__entity__ factor:__entity__ (:__entity__ NF:__entity__ ):__entity__ -kappaB:__entity__ in human macrophages .
However , after inhibition of the PI3K:__entity__ / Akt-1:__entity__ pathway , a marked decrease in the expression of the antiapoptotic:__entity__ molecule:__entity__ Mcl-1:__entity__ , but not other Bcl-2:__entity__ family:__entity__ members:__entity__ was observed , and Mcl-1:__entity__ rescued macrophages from LY294002-induced cell death .
Further , inhibition of Mcl-1:__entity__ by antisense oligonucleotides , also resulted in macrophage apoptosis .
Thus , our findings demonstrate that the constitutive activation of Akt-1:__entity__ regulates macrophage survival through Mcl-1:__entity__ , which is independent of caspases:__entity__ , NF-kappaB:__entity__ , or Bad:__entity__ .
GRbeta expression in nasal polyp inflammatory cells and its relationship to the anti-inflammatory effects of intranasal fluticasone .
BACKGROUND : Nasal polyposis disease is an inflammatory disorder with intense eosinophilic infiltration of respiratory mucosa that is often difficult to control with topical steroids .
Recent evidence suggests that overexpression of the glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ splice:__entity__ variant:__entity__ GRbeta:__entity__ in inflammatory cells might contribute to steroid insensitivity in diseases such as asthma .
OBJECTIVE : The purposes of this investigation were to determine whether nasal polyp ( NP ) inflammatory cells overexpress GRbeta:__entity__ and to examine whether GRbeta:__entity__ overexpression is associated with insensitivity to the potent topical steroid fluticasone propionate ( FP ) .
METHODS : Biopsies were obtained from 10 subjects with NPs before and 4 weeks after treatment with intranasal FP .
Middle turbinates biopsies from 6 healthy , nonallergic subjects served as normal controls .
Biopsies were immunostained for inflammatory cell markers as well as GRbeta:__entity__ and probed for various cytokine:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ .
The anti-inflammatory response to FP was examined in relation to pretreatment levels of GRbeta expression .
RESULTS : The total numbers of inflammatory cells were increased in NPs .
The percentage of inflammatory cells expressing GRbeta:__entity__ was also increased ( 40.5 % +/- 19.2 % vs 16.1 % +/- 4.0 % , P =.009 ) .
GRbeta:__entity__ expression in NPs was almost exclusive to T lymphocytes , eosinophils , and macrophages .
An inverse correlation was observed between the baseline inflammatory cell GRbeta:__entity__ expression and the reduction after FP treatment in EG2-positive eosinophils , CD4-positive T lymphocytes , endothelial VCAM-1:__entity__ expression , and IL-4 mRNA-positive cells .
NPs that were `` FP-insensitive '' in terms of suppression of eosinophil numbers ( major:__entity__ basic:__entity__ protein:__entity__ -positive ) had a significantly greater percentage of GRbeta-positive inflammatory cells , a higher ratio of GRbeta-positive/GRalpha-positive cells , and increased numbers of GRbeta-positive eosinophils and macrophages in comparison with those that were `` FP-sensitive. ''
`` FP-insensitive '' NPs also demonstrated a higher percentage of IL-5-positive inflammatory cells expressing GRbeta:__entity__ before and after FP treatment .
CONCLUSION : GRbeta:__entity__ expression appears to be a marker of steroid insensitivity in NPs .
Expression of GRbeta:__entity__ by NP inflammatory cells , particularly T cells and eosinophils , might render them resistant to suppression by topical steroids and thereby contribute to persistent NP inflammation .
Transcriptional regulation of galectin-10:__entity__ ( eosinophil:__entity__ Charcot-Leyden:__entity__ crystal:__entity__ protein:__entity__ ) : a GC:__entity__ box:__entity__ ( -44 to -50 ) controls butyric acid induction of gene expression .
Galectin-10:__entity__ ( gal-10:__entity__ , also known as Charcot-Leyden:__entity__ crystal:__entity__ protein:__entity__ ) is a member of the galectin:__entity__ family:__entity__ of beta-galactoside:__entity__ binding:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ that is expressed uniquely in eosinophilic and basophilic leukocytes .
To gain a better understanding of galectin gene expression , we present an analysis of the transcriptional regulation of the gene encoding gal-10:__entity__ .
Analysis of the minimal:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ revealed nine consensus-binding:__entity__ sites:__entity__ for transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ , including several that are also found in the minimal:__entity__ promoters:__entity__ of galectins:__entity__ -1:__entity__ ,:__entity__ -2:__entity__ ,:__entity__ and:__entity__ -3:__entity__ .
The decrease in gal-10 promoter activity after disruption of either the GC:__entity__ box:__entity__ ( -44 to -50 ) or the Oct:__entity__ site:__entity__ ( -255 to -261 ) suggests that these sites , along with the previously characterized GATA:__entity__ and:__entity__ EoTF:__entity__ sites:__entity__ , are necessary for full promoter activity .
By supershift analysis , we demonstrate binding of the transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ Sp1:__entity__ and Oct1:__entity__ to the consensus:__entity__ GC:__entity__ box:__entity__ and the Oct:__entity__ site:__entity__ , respectively .
Similar to gal-1:__entity__ , gal-10 expression is induced by butyric acid , an effect that is lost upon ablation of the GC:__entity__ box:__entity__ .
Additionally , we demonstrate AML3 binding to the consensus:__entity__ AML:__entity__ site:__entity__ and YY1:__entity__ binding:__entity__ to the Inr:__entity__ sequence:__entity__ , both elements functioning as silencers in the gal-10:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ .
Tumour-stromal interactions .
Role of the stroma in mammary development .
Mammary development depends on branching morphogenesis , namely the bifurcation and extension of ductal growth points ( end buds ) and secretory lobules into a more or less fatty stroma .
Because breast carcinomas are overwhelmingly ductal in origin , this review focuses on stromal influences guiding postnatal ductal development and there is only the briefest account of the role of embryonic stroma ( mesenchyme ) .
The stroma as the necessary target for endocrine mammogens and the source of stimulatory growth factors is described and the importance of mammary epithelium-induced modifications of the periductal stroma is emphasized .
Evidence is presented that if they are to grow , end buds must condition proximal fatty stroma by recruiting white blood cells as well as inducing stromal cell division and , possibly , estrogen:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ .
The induction of a fibrous stromal tunic around the end bud is described and its likely role as a complex ductal morphogen is discussed ; a possible role in growth inhibition is also considered .
Although the signals governing fibrotic induction , ductal morphogenesis , and growth inhibition are unknown , a role for transforming growth:__entity__ factor-beta:__entity__ is highly likely and is discussed .
Finally , a need for new conceptual and experimental approaches to understanding stromal-epithelial signaling is discussed .
Adipophilin:__entity__ is a sensitive marker for lipid loading in human blood monocytes .
Adipophilin:__entity__ , a marker of lipid accumulation initially described in adipocytes , was recently shown to be induced in macrophage foam cells .
We found that even freshly isolated blood monocytes express adipophilin:__entity__ and that the amount of adipophilin:__entity__ protein:__entity__ is variable in monocytes from different healthy individuals .
However , the physiological expression of adipophilin:__entity__ does not correlate with the levels of free fatty acids , cholesterylesters or free cholesterol .
Enzymatically:__entity__ modified:__entity__ low-density:__entity__ lipoprotein:__entity__ ( E-LDL:__entity__ ) induces rapid foam cell formation in monocytes and upregulates adipophilin:__entity__ mRNA and protein within 2 h of incubation .
This rapid induction of adipophilin:__entity__ is accompanied by a significant increase of free fatty acids in monocytes incubated with E-LDL:__entity__ .
Adipophilin:__entity__ facilitates the uptake of free fatty acids , and here we demonstrate that free fatty acids increase is related to the early upregulation of adipophilin expression in blood monocytes .
Fatty acids are ligands for peroxisome:__entity__ proliferator-activated:__entity__ receptor-gamma:__entity__ ( PPARgamma:__entity__ ) , and the upregulation of adipophilin:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ by PPARgamma:__entity__ agonists like 15d-PGJ ( 2 ) and ciglitazone indicates that PPARgamma:__entity__ may mediate the induction of adipophilin expression in human blood monocytes .
Constitutive expression of MHC:__entity__ class:__entity__ II:__entity__ genes:__entity__ in melanoma cell lines results from the transcription of class:__entity__ II:__entity__ transactivator:__entity__ abnormally initiated from its B:__entity__ cell-specific:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ .
In melanoma cell lines , two different patterns of MHC class II expression have been described , either an IFN gamma-inducible expression of HLA-DR:__entity__ and HLA-DP:__entity__ , with a faint or null expression of HLA-DQ:__entity__ , resembling that described for melanocytes , or a constitutive expression , i.e. , IFN-gamma independent , of all three HLA-D:__entity__ isotypes:__entity__ .
As this latter phenotype has been associated with a more rapid progression of melanoma tumors , we have analyzed in different melanoma cell lines the molecular mechanisms leading to this abnormal pattern of MHC class II expression .
In agreement with the evidence of a coordinate transcription of the HLA-D:__entity__ genes:__entity__ in these cell lines , we have shown the constitutive expression of CIITA:__entity__ (:__entity__ class:__entity__ II:__entity__ transactivator:__entity__ ):__entity__ transcripts:__entity__ , CIITA:__entity__ being known as the master switch of MHC class II expression .
Unexpectedly , these transcripts initiate from promoter:__entity__ III:__entity__ of the CIITA:__entity__ gene:__entity__ , a promoter that is mainly used constitutively in B lymphocytes .
This expression was further shown to occur through factor ( s ) acting on the enhancer located upstream of CIITA:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ III:__entity__ , which was previously described in epithelioid cells as an IFN-gamma-response sequence .
The hypothesis of a general abnormality of the IFN-gamma transduction pathway was dismissed .
Constitutive transcription of CIITA:__entity__ from promoter:__entity__ III:__entity__ having been observed in unrelated melanoma cell lines , we propose the hypothesis that this phenomenon might not be a random event , but could be linked to the neoplasic state of the melanoma cells
Caspase:__entity__ -mediated calcineurin activation contributes to IL-2:__entity__ release during T cell activation .
Calcineurin:__entity__ , a Ca:__entity__ (:__entity__ 2+:__entity__ ):__entity__ /calmodulin-dependent:__entity__ Ser/Thr:__entity__ phosphatase:__entity__ (:__entity__ protein:__entity__ phosphatase:__entity__ 2B:__entity__ ):__entity__ , plays a critical role in IL-2 production during T cell activation .
It has been previously reported that IL-2:__entity__ release in activated Jurkat T requires caspase-like activity ( Posmantur et al. ( 1998 ) Exp. Cell. Res. 244 , 302-309 ) .
We report here that the 60-kDa:__entity__ catalytic:__entity__ subunit:__entity__ of calcineurin:__entity__ A:__entity__ ( Cn:__entity__ A:__entity__ ) was partially cleaved to a 45-kDa:__entity__ form in phytohemagglutinin A ( PHA ) or phorbol ester + ionomycin ( P + I ) -activated Jurkat cells .
In parallel , proteolytic activation of upstream caspases:__entity__ ( caspase-8 and -9 ) as well as effector:__entity__ caspase-3:__entity__ was also observed .
Cn:__entity__ A:__entity__ cleavage was caspase mediated , since it was inhibitable by pan-caspase inhibitor Cbz-Asp-CH ( 2 ) OC ( O ) -2 , 6-dichlorobenzene ( Z-D-DCB ) .
Cn:__entity__ A:__entity__ cleavage was also observed when purified calcineurin:__entity__ was digested in vitro with caspase-3:__entity__ .
Truncated:__entity__ Cn:__entity__ A:__entity__ was associated with enhanced phosphatase activity and reduced calmodulin sensitivity .
Furthermore , in PHA or P + I-activated Jurkat cells , dephosphorylation of calcineurin:__entity__ substrate NFATc:__entity__ ( a transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ known to be involved in transactivation of the IL-2:__entity__ gene:__entity__ ) , was also suppressed by Z-D-DCB .
Taken together , our results suggest that caspase-mediated cleavage of Cn:__entity__ A:__entity__ contributes to IL-2 production during T cell activation .

Maturation of human dendritic cells as sulfasalazine target .
AIM : Sulfasalazine , a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug , is effective in treating some autoimmune diseases , but its mechanism of action is unclear .
To determine whether dendritic cells could be a possible target of the drug , we studied the effects of sulfasalazine and its metabolites , aminosalicylate and sulfapyridine , on in vitro maturation ( terminal differentiation ) of human myeloid dendritic cells .
METHODS : We prepared immature dendritic cells by incubating CD14-positive cells in the presence of granulocyte-:__entity__ macrophage:__entity__ colony-stimulating:__entity__ factor:__entity__ and interleukin:__entity__ (:__entity__ IL:__entity__ ):__entity__ -4:__entity__ .
The cells were matured by addition of tumor:__entity__ necrosis:__entity__ factor:__entity__ (:__entity__ TNF:__entity__ ):__entity__ -a:__entity__ , IL-1:__entity__ beta:__entity__ , and prostaglandin:__entity__ E2:__entity__ in the presence of sulfasalazine or its metabolites -- aminosalicylate and sulfapyridine , or their combinations .
We quantified the effect of drugs on the dendritic cell characteristics , such as stimulation of autologous and allogeneic pan-T cell proliferation , surface marker phenotype , IL-12 p40 subunit secretion , and activation of nuclear:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ (:__entity__ NF:__entity__ ):__entity__ -kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ .
RESULTS : Dendritic cells treated with sulfasalazine ( 1.25 micromol/L or 2.5 micromol/L ) could not stimulate T cells ( p < 0.028 , two-sided paired t-test ) .
In distinction to drug-free maturing dendritic cells , 2.5 micromol/L sulfasalazine upregulated the levels of CD14:__entity__ and CD68:__entity__ and downregulated the levels of CD40:__entity__ , CD80:__entity__ , and CD83:__entity__ ( for all CD markers , p < 0.03 for difference between measurements in the absence and the presence of sulfasalazine ) .
From concentration-dependent changes in CD83 expression , we found an apparent ID50 > > 1.5 micromol/L sulfasalazine .
The apparent ID50 value for aminosalicylate-inhibited maturation was 4 micromol/L .
Sulfapyridine had no effect .
At 1.25 micromol/L , sulfasalazine largely inhibited NF-kB activation in dendritic cells .
CONCLUSION : Maturing human dendritic cells are hundred-fold more sensitive to sulfasalazine than T cells and NK cells and the most sensitive human cells described so far .
Thus , dendritic cell maturation is an important target of sulfasalazine .
Because of the role of dendritic cells in ( auto ) immunity , inhibition of their maturation might provide a target for further optimization of sulfasalazine therapy .
Defective function of the proteasome:__entity__ in autoimmunity : involvement of impaired NF-kappaB activation .
Type 1 diabetes ( also known as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or juvenile-onset diabetes ) is usually caused by T cell-mediated autoimmunity , with a prediabetic state characterized by the production of autoantibodies:__entity__ specific for proteins expressed by pancreatic beta cells .
The nonobese patient with diabetes ( NOD ) mouse is a spontaneous model of type 1 diabetes with a strong genetic component that maps to the major:__entity__ histocompatibility:__entity__ complex:__entity__ (:__entity__ MHC:__entity__ ):__entity__ region:__entity__ of the genome:__entity__ .
A specific proteasome:__entity__ defect has been identified in NOD mouse in select lymphocytic and monocytic lineages that results from down-regulation of expression of the proteasome:__entity__ subunit:__entity__ LMP2:__entity__ , which is encoded by a gene in the MHC:__entity__ genomic:__entity__ region:__entity__ .
This defect prevents the proteolytic processing required for the production and activation of the transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ nuclear:__entity__ factor-kappaB:__entity__ ( NF-kappaB:__entity__ ) , which plays important roles in immune and inflammatory responses , as well as increases the susceptibility of the affected cells to apoptosis induced by tumor:__entity__ necrosis:__entity__ factor-alpha:__entity__ ( TNF-alpha:__entity__ ) .
The novel role of the proteasome:__entity__ in dysfunction in autoimmunity is presented and documented to be both tissue and developmental stage specific .
We propose a role of the proteasome:__entity__ as a step in disease pathogenesis and tissue targeting .
Down-regulation of TDT transcription in CD4 ( + ) CD8 ( + ) thymocytes by Ikaros:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ in direct competition with an Ets:__entity__ activator:__entity__ .
Ikaros:__entity__ is a unique regulator of lymphopoiesis that associates with pericentromeric:__entity__ heterochromatin:__entity__ and has been implicated in heritable gene inactivation .
Binding and competition experiments demonstrate that Ikaros:__entity__ dimers:__entity__ compete with an Ets:__entity__ activator:__entity__ for occupancy of the lymphocyte-specific:__entity__ TdT:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ .
Mutations that selectively disrupt Ikaros binding to an integrated:__entity__ TdT:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ had no effect on promoter function in a CD4 ( + ) CD8 ( + ) thymocyte line .
However , these mutations abolished down-regulation on differentiation , providing evidence that Ikaros:__entity__ plays a direct role in repression .
Reduced access to restriction enzyme cleavage suggested that chromatin alterations accompany down-regulation .
The Ikaros-dependent down-regulation event and the observed chromatin alterations appear to precede pericentromeric repositioning .
Current models propose that the functions of Ikaros:__entity__ should be disrupted by a small isoform:__entity__ that retains the dimerization:__entity__ domain:__entity__ and lacks the DNA-binding:__entity__ domain:__entity__ .
Surprisingly , in the CD4 ( + ) CD8 ( + ) thymocyte line , overexpression of a small:__entity__ Ikaros:__entity__ isoform:__entity__ had no effect on differentiation or on the pericentromeric targeting and DNA-binding properties of Ikaros:__entity__ .
Rather , the small isoform:__entity__ assembled into multimeric:__entity__ complexes:__entity__ with DNA-bound:__entity__ Ikaros:__entity__ at the pericentromeric foci .
The capacity for in vivo multimer formation suggests that interactions between Ikaros:__entity__ dimers:__entity__ bound to the TdT:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ and those bound to pericentromeric:__entity__ repeat:__entity__ sequences:__entity__ may contribute to the pericentromeric repositioning of the inactive:__entity__ gene:__entity__ .
Type:__entity__ I:__entity__ interferons:__entity__ and IL-12:__entity__ : convergence and cross-regulation among mediators of cellular immunity .
Therapeutic use of type:__entity__ I:__entity__ IFN:__entity__ ( IFN-alpha/beta:__entity__ ) has become common .
Many of the diverse diseases targeted are marked by pathogenetic abnormalities in cell-mediated immunity ( CMI ) , these cellular immune responses either causing injury to the host , lacking sufficient vigor for virus or tumor clearance , or both .
In general , therapeutic efficacy is limited .
It is thus notable that the pleiotropic effects of type:__entity__ I:__entity__ IFN:__entity__ on CMI remain poorly understood .
We characterized the effects of type:__entity__ I:__entity__ IFN:__entity__ on the production of IL-12:__entity__ , the central:__entity__ immunoregulatory:__entity__ cytokine:__entity__ of the CD4:__entity__ (:__entity__ +:__entity__ ):__entity__ T:__entity__ cell:__entity__ arm:__entity__ of CMI .
We show that type:__entity__ I:__entity__ IFN:__entity__ are potent inhibitors of IL-12 production by human monocytes/macrophages .
The underlying mechanism involves transcriptional inhibition of the IL-12p40:__entity__ gene:__entity__ , marked by down-regulation of PU.1 binding activity at the upstream:__entity__ Ets:__entity__ site:__entity__ of the IL-12p40:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ .
Type:__entity__ I:__entity__ IFN:__entity__ have previously been shown to be able to substitute for IL-12:__entity__ in driving IFN-gamma production from T and NK cells .
The ability of IFN-alpha/beta:__entity__ to suppress IL-12 production while up-regulating IFN-gamma production suggests a possible mechanistic basis for the difficulties of employing these cytokines:__entity__ in diseases involving abnormalities of CMI .
Nuclear:__entity__ factor-kappaB:__entity__ suppressive and inhibitor-kappaB:__entity__ stimulatory effects of troglitazone in obese patients with type 2 diabetes : evidence of an antiinflammatory action ?
It has been shown recently that troglitazone exerts an anti-inflammatory effect , in vitro , and in experimental animals .
To test these properties in humans , we investigated the effect of troglitazone on the proinflammatory:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ nuclear:__entity__ factor-kappaB:__entity__ and its inhibitory:__entity__ protein:__entity__ IkappaB:__entity__ in mononuclear cells ( MNC ) and plasma:__entity__ soluble:__entity__ intracellular:__entity__ adhesion:__entity__ molecule-1:__entity__ , monocyte:__entity__ chemoattractant:__entity__ protein-1:__entity__ , plasminogen:__entity__ activator:__entity__ inhibitor-1:__entity__ , and C-reactive:__entity__ protein:__entity__ .
We also examined the effect of troglitazone on reactive oxygen species generation , p47 ( phox ) subunit expression , 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid ( 9-HODE ) , 13-HODE , o-tyrosine , and m-tyrosine in obese patients with type 2 diabetes .
Seven obese patients with type 2 diabetes were treated with troglitazone ( 400 mg/day ) for 4 weeks .
Blood samples were obtained at weekly intervals .
Nuclear:__entity__ factor-kappaB:__entity__ binding activity in MNC nuclear extracts was significantly inhibited after troglitazone treatment at week 1 and continued to be inhibited up to week 4 .
On the other hand , IkappaB protein levels increased significantly after troglitazone treatment at week 1 , and this increase persisted throughout the study .
Plasma:__entity__ monocyte:__entity__ chemoattractant:__entity__ protein-1:__entity__ and soluble:__entity__ intracellular:__entity__ adhesion:__entity__ molecule-1:__entity__ concentrations did not decrease significantly after troglitazone treatment , although there was a trend toward inhibition .
Reactive oxygen species generation by polymorphonuclear cells and MNC , p47:__entity__ (:__entity__ phox:__entity__ ):__entity__ subunit:__entity__ protein:__entity__ quantities , plasminogen:__entity__ activator:__entity__ inhibitor-1:__entity__ , and C-reactive:__entity__ protein:__entity__ levels decreased significantly after troglitazone intake .
13-HODE/linoleic acid and 9-HODE/linoleic acid ratios also decreased after troglitazone intake .
However , o-tyrosine/phenylalanine and m-tyrosine/phenylalanine ratios did not change significantly .
These data show that troglitazone has profound antiinflammatory effects in addition to antioxidant effects in obese type 2 diabetics ; these effects may be relevant to the recently described beneficial antiatherosclerotic effects of troglitazone at the vascular level .
OX40 stimulation by gp34/OX40:__entity__ ligand:__entity__ enhances productive human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection .
OX40:__entity__ is a member of the tumor:__entity__ necrosis:__entity__ factor:__entity__ (:__entity__ TNF:__entity__ ):__entity__ receptor:__entity__ superfamily:__entity__ and known to be an important costimulatory:__entity__ molecule:__entity__ expressed on activated T cells .
To investigate the role of costimulation of OX40:__entity__ in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection by its natural ligand , gp34:__entity__ , the OX40-transfected ACH-2 cell line , ACH-2/OX40 , chronically infected with HIV-1 , was cocultured with paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) -fixed gp34-transfected mouse cell line , SV-T2/gp34 .
The results showed that HIV-1 production was strongly induced .
This was followed by apparent apoptosis , and both processes were specifically inhibited by the gp34:__entity__ -specific neutralizing:__entity__ monoclonal:__entity__ antibody:__entity__ 5A8:__entity__ .
Endogenous TNF:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ ( TNF-alpha:__entity__ ) and TNF-beta:__entity__ production were not involved in the enhanced HIV-1 production .
Furthermore , enhanced HIV-1 transcription in gp34:__entity__ -stimulated ACH-2/OX40 cells was dependent on the kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ site:__entity__ of the HIV-1:__entity__ long:__entity__ terminal:__entity__ repeat:__entity__ , and the OX40-gp34 interaction activated NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ consisting of p50:__entity__ and:__entity__ p65:__entity__ subunits:__entity__ .
When primary activated CD4 ( + ) T cells acutely infected with HIV-1 ( NL4-3 ) ( CXCR4-using T-cell-line-tropic ) were cocultured with PFA-fixed gp34 ( + ) human T-cell leukemia virus type 1-bearing MT-2 cells or SV-T2/gp34 cells , HIV-1 production was also markedly enhanced .
The enhancement was again significantly inhibited by 5A8:__entity__ .
The present study first shows that OX40-gp34 interaction stimulates HIV-1 expression and suggests that OX40 triggering by gp34:__entity__ may play an important role in enhancing HIV-1 production in both acutely and latently infected CD4 ( + ) T cells in vivo .
Troglitazone , a PPARgamma ligand , inhibits osteopontin gene expression in human monocytes/macrophage THP-1 cells .
Peroxizome:__entity__ proliferator-activated:__entity__ receptor-gamma:__entity__ ( PPARgamma:__entity__ ) is a member of the nuclear:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ family:__entity__ of transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ that regulate adipocyte differentiation .
Recent studies indicate that liganded:__entity__ PPARgamma:__entity__ not only promotes differentiation but also inhibits the activation of macrophages .
Osteopontin:__entity__ , a component of extracellular matrix , is synthesized by macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques .
In this study , we examined whether PPARgamma:__entity__ ligand regulates osteopontin gene expression in THP-1 cells , a cell line derived from human monocytic leukemia cells which can differentiate to macrophage upon stimulation with phorbol ester PMA .
Northern blot analysis showed that osteopontin expression is markedly induced in response to PMA .
Troglitazone , a PPARgamma:__entity__ ligand , dramatically attenuated the PMA-induced osteopontin expression .
Transient transfection assays of the human:__entity__ osteopontin:__entity__ promoter/luciferase:__entity__ construct:__entity__ which contains a 5'-flanking:__entity__ region:__entity__ between -1500 and +87 relative to the transcription:__entity__ start:__entity__ site:__entity__ demonstrate that either treatment with troglitazone or cotransfection of PPARgamma:__entity__ expression:__entity__ vector:__entity__ inhibits osteopontin promoter activity .
These data indicate that troglitazone reduces osteopontin gene expression at transcriptional level through PPARgamma:__entity__ activation , and suggest the role of troglitazone in inhibiting the ability of macrophages to produce extracellular matrix , which is particularly relevant to atherosclerotic plaque formation .
Transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ regulates Ig:__entity__ lambda:__entity__ light chain gene rearrangement .
The tissue- and stage-specific assembly of Ig:__entity__ and:__entity__ TCR:__entity__ genes:__entity__ is mediated by a common V:__entity__ (:__entity__ D:__entity__ ):__entity__ J:__entity__ recombinase:__entity__ complex:__entity__ in precursor lymphocytes .
Directed alterations in the accessibility of V:__entity__ ,:__entity__ D:__entity__ ,:__entity__ and:__entity__ J:__entity__ gene:__entity__ segments:__entity__ target the recombinase:__entity__ to specific Ag:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ loci:__entity__ .
Accessibility within a given locus:__entity__ is regulated by the functional interaction of transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ with cognate:__entity__ enhancer:__entity__ elements:__entity__ and correlates with the transcriptional activity of unrearranged gene:__entity__ segments:__entity__ .
As demonstrated in our prior studies , rearrangement of the Igkappa:__entity__ locus:__entity__ is regulated by the inducible:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ NF-kappaB:__entity__ .
In contrast to the Igkappa:__entity__ locus:__entity__ , known transcriptional:__entity__ control:__entity__ elements:__entity__ in the Iglambda:__entity__ locus:__entity__ lack functional NF-kappaB:__entity__ binding:__entity__ sites:__entity__ .
Consistent with this observation , the expression of assembled Iglambda:__entity__ genes:__entity__ in mature B cells has been shown to be NF-kappaB:__entity__ independent .
Nonetheless , we now show that specific repression of NF-kappaB:__entity__ inhibits germline transcription and recombination of Iglambda:__entity__ gene:__entity__ segments:__entity__ in precursor B cells .
Molecular analyses indicate that the block in NF-kappaB:__entity__ impairs Iglambda rearrangement at the level of recombinase:__entity__ accessibility .
In contrast , the activities of known Iglambda:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ and enhancer:__entity__ elements:__entity__ are unaffected in the same cellular background .
These findings expand the range of NF-kappaB:__entity__ action in precursor B cells beyond Igkappa:__entity__ to include the control of recombinational accessibility at both L:__entity__ chain:__entity__ loci:__entity__ .
Moreover , our results strongly suggest the existence of a novel Iglambda:__entity__ regulatory:__entity__ element:__entity__ that is either directly or indirectly activated by NF-kappaB:__entity__ during the early stages of B cell development .
Transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ STAT5A:__entity__ is a substrate of Bruton:__entity__ 's:__entity__ tyrosine:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ in B cells .
STAT5A:__entity__ is a molecular regulator of proliferation , differentiation , and apoptosis in lymphohematopoietic cells .
Here we show that STAT5A:__entity__ can serve as a functional substrate of Bruton:__entity__ 's:__entity__ tyrosine:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ ( BTK:__entity__ ) .
Purified:__entity__ recombinant:__entity__ BTK:__entity__ was capable of directly binding purified:__entity__ recombinant:__entity__ STAT5A:__entity__ with high affinity ( K ( d ) = 44 nm ) , as determined by surface plasmon resonance using a BIAcore biosensor system .
BTK:__entity__ was also capable of tyrosine-phosphorylating ectopically expressed recombinant:__entity__ STAT5A:__entity__ on Tyr ( 694 ) both in vitro and in vivo in a Janus:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ 3:__entity__ -independent fashion .
BTK:__entity__ phosphorylated the Y665F:__entity__ ,:__entity__ Y668F:__entity__ ,:__entity__ and:__entity__ Y682F:__entity__ ,:__entity__ Y683F:__entity__ mutants:__entity__ but not the Y694F:__entity__ mutant:__entity__ of STAT5A:__entity__ .
STAT5A mutations in the Src:__entity__ homology:__entity__ 2:__entity__ (:__entity__ SH2:__entity__ ):__entity__ and:__entity__ SH3:__entity__ domains:__entity__ did not alter the BTK:__entity__ -mediated tyrosine phosphorylation .
Recombinant:__entity__ BTK:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ with mutant pleckstrin homology , SH2:__entity__ ,:__entity__ or:__entity__ SH3:__entity__ domains:__entity__ were capable of phosphorylating STAT5A:__entity__ , whereas recombinant:__entity__ BTK:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ with SH1/kinase domain mutations were not .
In pull-down experiments , only full-length:__entity__ BTK:__entity__ and its SH1/kinase:__entity__ domain:__entity__ ( but not the pleckstrin homology , SH2:__entity__ ,:__entity__ or:__entity__ SH3:__entity__ domains:__entity__ ) were capable of binding STAT5A:__entity__ .
Ectopically expressed BTK:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ domain:__entity__ was capable of tyrosine-phosphorylating STAT5A:__entity__ both in vitro and in vivo .
BTK:__entity__ -mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of ectopically expressed wild type ( but not Tyr:__entity__ (:__entity__ 694:__entity__ ):__entity__ mutant:__entity__ ) STAT5A:__entity__ enhanced its DNA binding activity .
In BTK:__entity__ -competent chicken B cells , anti-IgM-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5:__entity__ protein:__entity__ was prevented by pretreatment with the BTK:__entity__ inhibitor LFM-A13 but not by pretreatment with the JAK3 inhibitor HI-P131 .
B cell antigen receptor ligation resulted in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5:__entity__ in BTK:__entity__ -deficient chicken B cells reconstituted with wild:__entity__ type:__entity__ human:__entity__ BTK:__entity__ but not in BTK:__entity__ -deficient chicken B cells reconstituted with kinase-inactive:__entity__ mutant:__entity__ BTK:__entity__ .
Similarly , anti-IgM stimulation resulted in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5A:__entity__ in BTK:__entity__ -competent B cells from wild type mice but not in BTK:__entity__ -deficient B cells from XID mice .
In contrast to B cells from XID mice , B cells from JAK3 knockout mice showed a normal STAT5A phosphorylation response to anti-IgM stimulation .
These findings provide unprecedented experimental evidence that BTK:__entity__ plays a nonredundant and pivotal role in B cell antigen receptor-mediated STAT5A activation in B cells
Role of T-bet:__entity__ in commitment of TH1 cells before IL-12:__entity__ -dependent selection .
How cytokines:__entity__ control differentiation of helper T ( TH ) cells is controversial .
We show that T-bet:__entity__ , without apparent assistance from interleukin:__entity__ 12:__entity__ (:__entity__ IL-12:__entity__ ):__entity__ / STAT4:__entity__ , specifies TH1 effector fate by targeting chromatin remodeling to individual interferon-gamma:__entity__ (:__entity__ IFN-gamma:__entity__ ):__entity__ alleles:__entity__ and by inducing IL-12:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ beta2:__entity__ expression .
Subsequently , it appears that IL-12:__entity__ / STAT4:__entity__ serves two essential functions in the development of TH1 cells : as growth:__entity__ signal:__entity__ , inducing survival and cell division ; and as trans-activator:__entity__ , prolonging IFN-gamma:__entity__ synthesis through a genetic interaction with the coactivator:__entity__ , CREB-binding:__entity__ protein:__entity__ .
These results suggest that a cytokine:__entity__ does not simply induce TH fate choice but instead may act as an essential secondary stimulus that mediates selective survival of a lineage .
Stat6:__entity__ is necessary and sufficient for IL-4 's role in Th2 differentiation and cell expansion .
IL-4:__entity__ plays a critical role in the differentiation of T CR-stimulated naive CD4 T cells to the Th2 phenotype .
In response to IL-4:__entity__ , the IL-4R:__entity__ activates a set of phosphotyrosine:__entity__ binding:__entity__ domain-containing:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ , including insulin:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ substrate:__entity__ 1/2:__entity__ , Shc:__entity__ , and IL-4R:__entity__ interacting:__entity__ protein:__entity__ , as well as Stat6:__entity__ .
Stat6:__entity__ has been shown to be required for Th2 differentiation .
To determine the roles of the phosphotyrosine:__entity__ binding:__entity__ adaptors:__entity__ in Th2 differentiation , we prepared a retrovirus containing a mutant of the human:__entity__ (:__entity__ h:__entity__ ):__entity__ IL-4R:__entity__ alpha-chain:__entity__ , Y497F:__entity__ , which is unable to recruit these adaptors .
The mutant:__entity__ hIL-4Ralpha:__entity__ , as well as the wild-type:__entity__ (:__entity__ WT:__entity__ ):__entity__ hIL-4Ralpha:__entity__ , was introduced into naive CD4 T cells .
Upon hIL-4 stimulation , Y497F:__entity__ worked as well as the WT:__entity__ hIL-4Ralpha:__entity__ in driving Th2 differentiation , as measured by Gata3 up-regulation and IL-4 production .
Furthermore , IL-4-driven cell expansion was also normal in the cells infected with Y497F:__entity__ , although cells infected with Y497F:__entity__ were not capable of phosphorylating insulin:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ substrate:__entity__ 2:__entity__ .
These results suggest that the signal pathway mediated by Y497:__entity__ is dispensable for both IL-4:__entity__ -driven Th2 differentiation and cell expansion .
Both WT:__entity__ and:__entity__ Y497F:__entity__ hIL-4Ralpha:__entity__ lose the ability to drive Th2 differentiation and cell expansion in Stat6-knockout CD4 T cells .
A constitutively activated form of Stat6:__entity__ introduced into CD4 T cells resulted in both Th2 differentiation and enhanced cell expansion .
Thus , activated:__entity__ Stat6:__entity__ is necessary and sufficient to mediate both IL-4:__entity__ -driven Th2 differentiation and cell expansion in CD4 T cells .
The effect of HIV-1:__entity__ regulatory:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ on cellular genes : derepression of the IL-2:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ by Tat:__entity__ .
In HIV-infected individuals dysregulation of the immune system is characterized by severe disorders of the cytokine network .
Increase secretion of IL-2:__entity__ , the major T cell growth and differentiation cytokine:__entity__ , may play a decisive role in sensitization of T cells for activation induced apoptosis and indirect death of activated T cells through augmented virus replication .
We investigated the cause of enhanced IL-2 secretion and found that the HIV:__entity__ Tat:__entity__ induces this effect .
We demonstrate that increased IL-2 secretion is due to Tat:__entity__ -enhanced IL-2:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ activation .
Tat:__entity__ derepresses and activates the distal:__entity__ AP-1:__entity__ site:__entity__ ( position:__entity__ -185:__entity__ to:__entity__ -177:__entity__ ) in the IL-2:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ .
In nonstimulated T cells a repressor complex containing NF-IL6:__entity__ , JunB:__entity__ , c-Fos:__entity__ and Fra-1:__entity__ is formed on the AP-1:__entity__ (:__entity__ IL-2/d:__entity__ ):__entity__ site:__entity__ and represses IL-2:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ activity .
After T cell activation , a heterodimeric:__entity__ activator:__entity__ containing p65:__entity__ and c-Jun:__entity__ binds to the AP-1:__entity__ (:__entity__ IL-2/d:__entity__ ):__entity__ site:__entity__ .
HIV:__entity__ Tat:__entity__ enhances activation of NF-kappaB:__entity__ and consequently , activates the AP-1:__entity__ (:__entity__ IL-2/d:__entity__ ):__entity__ site:__entity__ .
Our data provide evidence for a novel mechanism by which HIV:__entity__ Tat:__entity__ dysregulates IL-2 production and therefore may contribute to the HIV-1 infection in a way yet to be clarified .
Transforming:__entity__ growth:__entity__ factor-beta1:__entity__ interferes with thrombopoietin-induced signal transduction in megakaryoblastic and erythroleukemic cells .
OBJECTIVE : Thrombopoietin:__entity__ ( TPO:__entity__ ) and transforming:__entity__ growth:__entity__ factor-beta:__entity__ (:__entity__ 1:__entity__ ):__entity__ ( TGF-beta:__entity__ (:__entity__ 1:__entity__ ):__entity__ ) have been shown to exert opposite effects on proliferation and megakaryocytic differentiation of hematopoietic cells .
To determine whether TGF-beta:__entity__ (:__entity__ 1:__entity__ ):__entity__ interferes directly with TPO:__entity__ -induced signal transduction in hematopoietic cells , we compared the regulatory effects in the TPO:__entity__ -responsive cell lines Mo-7e and HEL .
MATERIALS AND METHODS : The cells were stimulated by 100 ng/mL TPO:__entity__ and/or 100 ng/mL TGF-beta1:__entity__ and analyzed for proliferation ( 3H thymidine incorporation ) , viability ( trypan blue exclusion ) , and protein expression and phosphorylation ( Western blot ) .
RESULTS : TPO:__entity__ enhanced the proliferation of Mo-7e cells as determined by 3H-thymidine incorporation , whereas TGF-beta1:__entity__ suppressed baseline cell growth and antagonized the proliferative effect of TPO:__entity__ .
TPO:__entity__ -induced proliferation also was reduced by a specific inhibitor of the mitogen-activated:__entity__ protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ ( MAPK:__entity__ ) pathway ( PD098059 ) , which inhibits activation of the MAPK:__entity__ extracellular:__entity__ signal-regulated:__entity__ kinases:__entity__ ( ERK:__entity__ ) ERK1:__entity__ and ERK2:__entity__ , and AG490 , an inhibitor of Janus:__entity__ kinase-2:__entity__ , which completely blocked TPO:__entity__ -induced proliferation .
As demonstrated by Western blotting , TGF-beta1:__entity__ reduced the TPO:__entity__ -stimulated ERK1:__entity__ / ERK2:__entity__ and STAT5 phosphorylation in Mo-7e and HEL cells .
This effect was completely reversed by preincubation with a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor ( Na3VO4 ) , which suggests that TGF-beta1:__entity__ activated a phosphatase:__entity__ .
Although STAT3:__entity__ also was activated by TPO:__entity__ , STAT3:__entity__ activation remained unaltered by TGF-beta1:__entity__ .
CONCLUSION : Taken together , these data suggest that TGF-beta1:__entity__ modulates TPO:__entity__ -mediated effects on megakaryocytic proliferation by interfering with TPO:__entity__ -induced signal transduction , particularly by reducing the activities of MAPK:__entity__ ERK1/ERK2:__entity__ and:__entity__ STAT5:__entity__ .
Invariant:__entity__ chain:__entity__ induces B cell maturation by activating a TAF:__entity__ (:__entity__ II:__entity__ ):__entity__ 105-NF-kappaB:__entity__ -dependent transcription program .
Early stages of B cell development occur in the bone marrow , resulting in formation of immature B cells .
From there these immature cells migrate to the spleen where they differentiate to mature cells .
This final maturation step is crucial for the B cells to become responsive to antigens:__entity__ and to participate in the immune response .
Recently , invariant:__entity__ chain:__entity__ ( Ii:__entity__ ) , a major:__entity__ histocompatibility:__entity__ complex:__entity__ class:__entity__ II:__entity__ chaperone:__entity__ , as well as the transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ c-Rel:__entity__ and p65/RelA:__entity__ , were found to play a role in the final antigen-independent differentiation stage of B cells in the spleen .
In this study , we investigated a possible link between Ii:__entity__ -dependent B cell maturation and the NF-kappaB pathway .
Our studies indicate that Ii:__entity__ -induced B cell maturation involves activation of transcription mediated by the NF-kappaB:__entity__ p65/RelA:__entity__ homodimer:__entity__ and requires the B:__entity__ cell-enriched:__entity__ coactivator:__entity__ TBP-associated:__entity__ factor:__entity__ (:__entity__ II:__entity__ ):__entity__ 105:__entity__ .
Androgens indirectly accelerate thymocyte apoptosis .
Apoptotic processes , or the disturbance of the natural regulation of these processes , may be involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases ( AID ) .
Women are , in general , more susceptible than men to develop AID like rheumatoid arthritis .
Androgens and glucocorticoids , in contrast to oestrogens , have favourable effects in AID models as well as in human AID .
It is known that glucocorticoids ( GC ) , used for treatment of AID , increase apoptosis in the thymus resulting in decreased numbers of CD4+ CD8+ thymocytes .
It was asked whether androgens , in contrast to oestrogens , exert their favourable effects in the treatment of AID by a mechanism comparable to that described for GC by eliminating the apoptosis prone CD4+ CD8+ population in the thymus .
Although both androgens and oestrogens proved thymolytic , a significantly decreased percentage of CD4+ CD8+ thymocytes was observed by flow cytometry after treatment of mice with the androgen methyltestosterone , but not with the oestrogen ethinylestradiol .
To investigate whether the observed thymolytic effects were due to the presence of hormone:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ on thymocytes , cells were isolated from the thymus and incubated with androgens or oestrogens to measure apoptosis .
Several techniques were used to determine thymocyte apoptosis in vitro , but no enhanced apoptotic signal was observed .
Using the very sensitive TUNEL assay , no direct effect of androgens on thymocytes in vitro could be observed .
This is in sharp contrast to the high signal observed with GC .
Therefore , upon in vivo androgen treatment , other cells containing androgen:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ than thymocytes are probably involved in inducing the increase in thymic apoptosis .
To study the role of the androgen:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ on thymocyte apoptosis , androgen:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ mutant ( Tfm/Y ) mice were treated with androgens .
No alterations of thymocyte subpopulations were seen , suggesting that changes in the percentage of CD4+ CD8+ thymocytes after administration of androgens depend on the presence of functional androgen:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ .
Thus , it is concluded that androgens indirectly accelerate thymocyte apoptosis in vivo .
Inhibition of the transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ AP-1:__entity__ and NF-kappaB:__entity__ in CD4 T cells by peroxisome:__entity__ proliferator-activated:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ gamma:__entity__ ligands:__entity__ .
The peroxisome:__entity__ proliferator-activated:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ gamma:__entity__ ( PPARgamma:__entity__ ) , a member of the nuclear:__entity__ hormone:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ superfamily:__entity__ , is essential for adipocyte differentiation and glucose homeostasis .
PPARgamma:__entity__ has been found recently to regulate macrophage activation in response to mitogens:__entity__ and inflammation .
Our study shows PPARgamma:__entity__ to be preferentially expressed in the nuclei of resting T cells and to increase upon activation of T cells by either anti-CD3:__entity__ and anti-CD28:__entity__ or phorbol myristyl acetate ( PMA ) .
We also found the PPARgamma:__entity__ ligand:__entity__ ciglitizone to attenuate the activation of T cells by inhibiting cytokine gene expression and anti-CD3:__entity__ and anti-CD28:__entity__ or PMA-induced proliferative responses .
Inhibition of both the proliferative response and inflammatory cytokine expression in CD4 T cells was correlated with suppression of the activated transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ AP1:__entity__ and NF-kappaB:__entity__ .
PPARgamma:__entity__ ligands:__entity__ also strongly inhibited SEA-induced Vbeta3 T cell activation in vivo .
These results , together with previous findings of the inhibitory effect of PPARgamma:__entity__ ligands:__entity__ on activated macrophages , provide clear evidence for PPARgamma:__entity__ as a negative:__entity__ regulator:__entity__ of the inflammatory activation of both macrophage and T cells .
PPARgamma:__entity__ may thus be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of autoimmunity .
A prominent role for activator:__entity__ protein-1:__entity__ in the transcription of the human:__entity__ 2B4:__entity__ (:__entity__ CD244:__entity__ ):__entity__ gene:__entity__ in NK cells .
The cell:__entity__ surface:__entity__ glycoprotein:__entity__ 2B4:__entity__ ( CD244:__entity__ ) of the Ig:__entity__ superfamily:__entity__ is involved in the regulation of NK and T lymphocyte functions .
We have recently identified CD48:__entity__ as the high:__entity__ affinity:__entity__ counterreceptor:__entity__ for 2B4:__entity__ in both mice and humans .
The cytoplasmic:__entity__ domain:__entity__ of 2B4:__entity__ associates with src:__entity__ homology:__entity__ 2:__entity__ domain-containing:__entity__ protein:__entity__ or signaling:__entity__ lymphocyte:__entity__ activation:__entity__ molecule-associated:__entity__ protein:__entity__ , whose mutation is the underlying genetic defect in the X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome .
In this study , we report the molecular cloning and characterization of the human:__entity__ 2B4:__entity__ (:__entity__ h2B4:__entity__ ):__entity__ promoter:__entity__ .
Through primer extension analysis , we found that the transcription of the h2B4:__entity__ gene:__entity__ initiates at multiple start sites .
We isolated h2B4:__entity__ genomic:__entity__ clones:__entity__ and PCR amplified the 5:__entity__ ':__entity__ untranslated:__entity__ region:__entity__ containing the promoter:__entity__ elements:__entity__ .
We have identified a functional AP-1:__entity__ site:__entity__ that lies between ( -106 to -100 ) through transient transfection analysis in YT cells , a human NK cell line .
EMSAs with Abs:__entity__ specific for various protein:__entity__ factors:__entity__ of the AP-1:__entity__ family:__entity__ revealed that multiple members of the Jun:__entity__ family:__entity__ are involved in the regulation of the h2B4:__entity__ gene:__entity__ .
Mutation of the AP-1:__entity__ site:__entity__ not only abolishes protein/DNA interactions but also promoter activity .
These results demonstrate a significant role for AP-1:__entity__ in the transcriptional regulation of the h2B4:__entity__ gene:__entity__ .
Functional correction of FA-C cells with FANCC:__entity__ suppresses the expression of interferon:__entity__ gamma-inducible:__entity__ genes:__entity__ .
Because hematopoietic cells derived from Fanconi anemia ( FA ) patients of the C-complementation group ( FA-C ) are hypersensitive to the inhibitory effects of interferon:__entity__ gamma:__entity__ ( IFNgamma:__entity__ ) , the products of certain IFNgamma-inducible:__entity__ genes:__entity__ known to influence hematopoietic cell survival were quantified .
High constitutive expression of the IFNgamma-inducible:__entity__ genes:__entity__ , IFN-stimulated:__entity__ gene:__entity__ factor:__entity__ 3:__entity__ gamma:__entity__ subunit:__entity__ ( ISGF3gamma:__entity__ ) , IFN:__entity__ regulatory:__entity__ factor-1:__entity__ ( IRF-1:__entity__ ) , and the cyclin-dependent:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ inhibitor:__entity__ p21:__entity__ ( WAF1:__entity__ ) was found in FANCC:__entity__ mutant B lymphoblasts , low-density bone marrow cells , and murine embryonic fibroblasts .
Paradoxically , these cells do not activate:__entity__ signal:__entity__ transducer:__entity__ and:__entity__ activator:__entity__ of:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ (:__entity__ STAT:__entity__ ):__entity__ 1:__entity__ properly .
In an attempt to clarify mechanisms by which FA-C cells overexpress IFNgamma-inducible:__entity__ genes:__entity__ in the face of defective STAT1 phosphorylation , it was reasoned that decreased levels of activated:__entity__ STAT1:__entity__ might result in reduced expression of a hematopoietic:__entity__ IFNgamma-responsive:__entity__ protein:__entity__ that normally modulates expression of other IFNgamma-responsive:__entity__ genes:__entity__ .
Levels of the IFNgamma:__entity__ -inducible factor IFN:__entity__ consensus:__entity__ sequence:__entity__ binding:__entity__ protein:__entity__ ( ICSBP:__entity__ ) , a negative:__entity__ trans-acting:__entity__ regulator:__entity__ of some IFNgamma-inducible:__entity__ genes:__entity__ , were quantified .
ICSBP:__entity__ levels were reduced in FA-C B lymphoblasts and MEFs .
However , enforced expression of ICSBP:__entity__ failed to down-regulate IRF-1:__entity__ , ISGF3gamma:__entity__ , and p21:__entity__ (:__entity__ WAF1:__entity__ ):__entity__ .
Thus , the FANCC:__entity__ protein:__entity__ functions to modulate expression of a family of genes that in normal cells are inducible only by specific environmental cues for apoptosis or mitogenic inhibition , but it does so independently of the classic IFN-STAT1 pathway and is not the direct result of reduced ICSBP:__entity__ expression .
A genetic investigation of E2A function in lymphocyte development .
Lymphocytes are derived from hematopoietic stem cells ( HSC ) following a series of regulated differentiation events .
Multipotent HSCs become committed to the B cell lineage in bone marrow and the T cell lineage in the thymus after receiving appropriate signals from the corresponding microenvironment .
These committed lymphoid cells must then undergo V ( D ) J recombination at the immunoglobulin:__entity__ gene:__entity__ or T:__entity__ cell:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ gene:__entity__ locus:__entity__ resulting in clonal production of functional B or T lymphocytes , respectively .
Lymphocyte commitment and differentiation are accompanied by programmed gene expression or repression events which are driven by lineage:__entity__ and:__entity__ stage:__entity__ specific:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ .
The basic-helix-loop-helix:__entity__ (:__entity__ bHLH:__entity__ ):__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ encoded by the E2A:__entity__ gene:__entity__ are involved in several differentiation events during B and T cell development , including lineage commitment , initiation of V ( D ) J recombination , and antigen receptor mediated proliferation and differentiation .
Several recent reviews have provided a comprehensive discussion of biochemical , cellular , and genetic research on E2A function in lymphocyte development ( 1 , 2 ) .
Here , we only discuss some of the genetic approaches our laboratory ( except where it is noted ) has undertaken to investigate the molecular pathways mediated by E2A:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ in lymphocyte development
D609 inhibits ionizing radiation-induced oxidative damage by acting as a potent antioxidant .
Tricyclodecan-9-yl-xanthogenate ( D609 ) has been extensively studied in biological systems and exhibits a variety of biological functions , including antiviral , antitumor , and anti-inflammatory activities .
Most of these activities have been largely attributed to the inhibitory effect of D609 on phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase:__entity__ C:__entity__ .
However , as a xanthate derivative , D609 is a strong electrolyte and readily dissociates to xanthate anions and cations of alkali metals in solution .
Xanthate anions and protonated xanthic acid contain a free thiol moiety and are highly reductive .
This implies that D609 and other xanthate derivatives may function as potent antioxidants .
Indeed , we found that D609 inhibited the Fenton reaction-induced oxidation of dihydrorhodamine 123 in a dose-dependent manner similar to that of pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate , a well known antioxidant .
In addition , D609 inhibited the formation of the alpha-phenyl-tert-butylnitrone-free radical spin adducts and lipid peroxidation of synaptosomal membranes by the Fenton reagents .
Furthermore , preincubation of lymphocytes with D609 resulted in a significant diminution of ionizing radiation ( IR ) -induced 1 ) production of reactive oxygen species ; 2 ) decrease in intracellular reduced glutathione ; 3 ) oxidative damage to proteins and lipids ; and 4 ) activation of nuclear:__entity__ factor-kappaB:__entity__ .
Moreover , when D609 ( 50 mg/kg i.v. ) was administered to mice 10 min prior to total body IR ( 6.5 and 8.5 Gy ) , it protected the mice from IR-induced lethality .
Thus , these results indicate that D609 is a potent antioxidant and has the ability to inhibit IR-induced cellular oxidative stress .
Inhibition of AP-1:__entity__ by the glucocorticoid-inducible protein:__entity__ GILZ:__entity__ .
The immunosuppressive effects of glucocorticoids arise largely by inhibition of cytokine gene expression , which has been ascribed to interference between the glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ and transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ such as AP-1:__entity__ and NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ as well as by competition for common coactivators .
Here we show that glucocorticoid-induced inhibition of interleukin-2 mRNA expression in activated normal T cells required new protein synthesis , suggesting that this phenomenon is secondary to expression of glucocorticoid-regulated genes:__entity__ .
One of the most prominent glucocorticoid-induced genes:__entity__ is glucocorticoid-induced:__entity__ leucine:__entity__ zipper:__entity__ ( GILZ:__entity__ ) , which has been reported to inhibit activation-induced up-regulation of Fas:__entity__ ligand:__entity__ (:__entity__ FasL:__entity__ ):__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ .
Indeed , transient expression of GILZ:__entity__ in Jurkat T cells blocked induction of a reporter:__entity__ construct:__entity__ driven by the FasL:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ .
This could be accounted for by GILZ:__entity__ -mediated inhibition of Egr-2:__entity__ and Egr-3:__entity__ , NFAT/AP-1:__entity__ -inducible transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ that bind a regulatory:__entity__ element:__entity__ in the FasL:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ and up-regulate FasL expression .
GILZ:__entity__ also potently inhibited AP-1-driven:__entity__ and:__entity__ IL-2:__entity__ promoter-driven:__entity__ reporter:__entity__ constructs:__entity__ , and recombinant GILZ:__entity__ specifically interacted with c-Fos:__entity__ and c-Jun:__entity__ in vitro and inhibited the binding of active:__entity__ AP-1:__entity__ to its target DNA .
Whereas homodimerization of GILZ:__entity__ required the presence of its leucine:__entity__ zipper:__entity__ , the interaction with c-Fos:__entity__ and c-Jun:__entity__ occurred through the N-terminal:__entity__ 60-amino:__entity__ acid:__entity__ region:__entity__ of GILZ:__entity__ .
Thus , GILZ:__entity__ represents a glucocorticoid-induced gene product that can inhibit a variety of activation-induced events , at least in part by direct interference with AP-1:__entity__ , and is therefore a candidate for a mediator of glucocorticoid-induced immunosuppression .
Pharmacokinetic differences between a T cell-tolerizing and a T cell-activating peptide .
Vaccination with a peptide representing a CTL epitope from the human papillomavirus ( HPV ) 16 E7:__entity__ protein:__entity__ induces a specific CTL response that prevents the outgrowth of HPV16 E7-expressing tumors .
In contrast , vaccination with a peptide encoding an adenovirus type 5 ( Ad5 ) E1A CTL epitope results in CTL tolerance and enhanced growth of an Ad5 E1A-expressing tumor .
It is unclear why these peptides induce such opposite effects .
To determine whether a difference in pharmacokinetics can explain the functional contrasts , tritiated Ad5 E1A and HPV16 E7 peptides were injected into mice .
Results show that the tolerizing peptide spread through the body 16 times faster than the activating peptide and was cleared at least 2 times faster .
The HPV16 E7 peptide kinetics correlated with the kinetics of HPV16:__entity__ E7:__entity__ -specific CTL induction .
In contrast , Ad5 E1A peptide injection resulted in physical deletion of preexisting Ad5:__entity__ E1A:__entity__ -specific CTLs:__entity__ within 24 h after injection .
This tolerization occurred at the time when the peptide reached its maximum peptide concentration in the organs .
These data suggest that ubiquitous expression of the tolerizing Ad5 E1A peptide within a short period of time causes activation-induced cell death of Ad5:__entity__ E1A:__entity__ -specific CTLs:__entity__ .
Therefore , information on the pharmacokinetics of peptides is vital for the safety and efficacy of peptide-based vaccines .
Smad3:__entity__ and Smad4:__entity__ mediate transforming:__entity__ growth:__entity__ factor-beta1:__entity__ -induced IgA expression in murine B lymphocytes .
Transforming:__entity__ growth:__entity__ factor:__entity__ (:__entity__ TGF:__entity__ ):__entity__ -beta1:__entity__ is well established as a critical IgA:__entity__ isotype:__entity__ switching:__entity__ factor:__entity__ and Smad:__entity__ molecules:__entity__ have been reported to act as transducers:__entity__ and transcriptional:__entity__ factors:__entity__ in the expression of TGF-beta1:__entity__ -targeted genes:__entity__ .
We examined the involvement of Smad:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ in TGF-beta1:__entity__ -induced IgA expression .
First , we found that TGF-beta1:__entity__ significantly increases endogenous:__entity__ germ-line:__entity__ (:__entity__ GL:__entity__ ):__entity__ alpha:__entity__ transcripts:__entity__ by LPS-stimulated CH12.LX.4933 ( mu ( + ) ) B lymphoma cells .
To investigate its signaling mechanisms , the lymphoma cell line was transfected with pFL3:__entity__ that contains the TGF-beta-responsive:__entity__ element:__entity__ of the GLalpha:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ , and stimulated with TGF-beta1:__entity__ .
Similar to endogenous:__entity__ GLalpha:__entity__ transcripts:__entity__ , TGF-beta1:__entity__ induces GLalpha:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ activity and overexpression of Smad3:__entity__ markedly enhances the promoter activity .
This activity is further augmented by cotransfected:__entity__ Smad4:__entity__ .
On the other hand , Smad7:__entity__ substantially abrogates the synergistic effect of Smad3/4:__entity__ on GLalpha:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ activity .
In addition , overexpression of Smad3/4:__entity__ enhances TGF-beta1:__entity__ -induced endogenous:__entity__ GLalpha:__entity__ transcripts:__entity__ in normal spleen B cell s .
Finally , in the presence of TGF-beta1:__entity__ , overexpression of Smad3/4:__entity__ selectively increases both surface IgA expression and IgA production .
The results from the present study indicate that Smad3:__entity__ , Smad4:__entity__ , and Smad7:__entity__ , at least in part , serve as mediators linking TGF-beta1:__entity__ to transcriptional regulation of IgA:__entity__ switching:__entity__ related:__entity__ gene:__entity__ and regulation of IgA class switching .
The translesion:__entity__ DNA:__entity__ polymerase:__entity__ zeta:__entity__ plays a major role in Ig and bcl-6 somatic hypermutation .
Ig somatic mutations would be introduced by a polymerase:__entity__ ( pol:__entity__ ) while repairing DNA outside main DNA replication .
We show that human B cells constitutively express the translesion:__entity__ pol:__entity__ zeta:__entity__ , which effectively extends DNA past mismatched bases ( mispair extender ) , and pol:__entity__ eta:__entity__ , which bypasses DNA lesions in an error-free fashion .
Upon B:__entity__ cell:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ ( BCR:__entity__ ) engagement and coculture with activated CD4+ T cells , these lymphocytes upregulated pol:__entity__ zeta:__entity__ , downregulated pol:__entity__ eta:__entity__ , and mutated the Ig:__entity__ and:__entity__ bcl-6:__entity__ genes:__entity__ .
Inhibition of the pol:__entity__ zeta:__entity__ REV3:__entity__ catalytic:__entity__ subunit:__entity__ by specific phosphorothioate-modified oligonucleotides impaired Ig and bcl-6 hypermutation and UV damage-induced DNA mutagenesis , without affecting cell cycle or viability .
Thus , pol:__entity__ zeta:__entity__ plays a critical role in Ig and bcl-6 hypermutation , perhaps facilitated by the downregulation of pol:__entity__ eta:__entity__ .
Molecular mechanism of cell cycle progression induced by the oncogene:__entity__ product:__entity__ Tax:__entity__ of human T-cell leukemia virus type I .
The trans-activator:__entity__ protein:__entity__ Tax:__entity__ of human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) plays an important role in the development of adult T-cell leukemia through , at least in part , its ability to stimulate cell growth .
We previously reported that Tax:__entity__ induced cell cycle progression from G0/G1 phase to S and G2/M phases in human T-cell line Kit 225 cells .
To elucidate molecular mechanism of Tax:__entity__ -induced cell cycle progression , we systematically examined the effects of Tax:__entity__ on biochemical events associated with cell cycle progression .
Introduction of Tax:__entity__ into resting Kit 225 cells induced activation of the G1/S transition regulation cascade consisting of activation of cyclin:__entity__ dependent:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ 2:__entity__ ( CDK2:__entity__ ) and CDK4:__entity__ , phosphorylation of the Rb:__entity__ family:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ and an increase in free E2F:__entity__ .
The kinase activation was found to result from Tax:__entity__ -induced expression of genes for cell:__entity__ cycle:__entity__ regulatory:__entity__ molecules:__entity__ including cyclin:__entity__ D2:__entity__ , cyclin:__entity__ E:__entity__ , E2F1:__entity__ , CDK2:__entity__ , CDK4:__entity__ and CDK6:__entity__ , and Tax:__entity__ -induced reduction of CDK:__entity__ inhibitors:__entity__ p19:__entity__ ( INK4d:__entity__ ) and p27:__entity__ (:__entity__ Kip1:__entity__ ):__entity__ .
These modulations by Tax:__entity__ always paralleled the ability of Tax:__entity__ to activate the NF-kappaB transcription pathway .
These results indicate the important role of Tax:__entity__ -mediated trans-activation of the genes for cell:__entity__ cycle:__entity__ regulatory:__entity__ molecules:__entity__ in Tax:__entity__ -induced cell cycle progression .
Cot:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ induces cyclooxygenase-2 expression in T cells through activation of the nuclear:__entity__ factor:__entity__ of:__entity__ activated:__entity__ T:__entity__ cells:__entity__ .
Cyclooxygenase-2:__entity__ ( COX-2:__entity__ ) is induced in human T lymphocytes upon T:__entity__ cell:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ triggering .
Here we report that Cot:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ , a mitogen-activated:__entity__ protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ involved in T cell activation , up-regulates COX-2:__entity__ gene:__entity__ expression in Jurkat T cells .
Induction of COX-2 promoter activity by Cot:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ occurred mainly through activation of the nuclear:__entity__ factor:__entity__ of:__entity__ activated:__entity__ T:__entity__ cells:__entity__ ( NFAT:__entity__ ) .
Mutation of the distal:__entity__ (:__entity__ -105/-97:__entity__ ):__entity__ and proximal:__entity__ (:__entity__ -76/-61:__entity__ ):__entity__ NFAT:__entity__ response:__entity__ elements:__entity__ in the COX-2:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ abolished the activation induced by Cot:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ .
Even more , coexpression of a dominant negative version of NFAT:__entity__ inhibited Cot:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ -mediated COX-2:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ activation , whereas cotransfection of a constitutively active version of the calcium-dependent:__entity__ phosphatase:__entity__ calcineurin:__entity__ synergizes with Cot:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ in the up-regulation of COX-2:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ -driven transcription .
Strikingly , Cot:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ increased transactivation mediated by a GAL4-NFAT:__entity__ fusion:__entity__ protein:__entity__ containing the N-terminal:__entity__ transactivation:__entity__ domain:__entity__ of NFATp:__entity__ .
In contrast to phorbol ester plus calcium ionophore A23187 , Cot:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ increases both COX-2:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ activity and NFAT:__entity__ -mediated transactivation in a cyclosporin A-independent manner .
These data indicate that Cot:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ up-regulates COX-2:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ -driven transcription through the NFAT:__entity__ response:__entity__ elements:__entity__ , being the Cot:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ -induced NFAT:__entity__ -dependent transactivation presumably implicated in this up-regulation .
Positive and negative roles of the trans-acting:__entity__ T:__entity__ cell:__entity__ factor-1:__entity__ for the acquisition of distinct Ly-49:__entity__ MHC:__entity__ class:__entity__ I:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ by NK cells .
Members of the Ly-49:__entity__ gene:__entity__ family:__entity__ code for class:__entity__ I:__entity__ MHC-specific:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ that regulate NK cell function .
Due to a combinatorial distribution of Ly-49:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ , NK cells display considerable clonal heterogeneity .
The acquisition of one Ly-49:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ , Ly-49A:__entity__ is strictly dependent on the transcriptional:__entity__ trans-acting:__entity__ factor:__entity__ T:__entity__ cell-specific:__entity__ factor-1:__entity__ ( TCF-1:__entity__ ) .
Indeed , TCF-1:__entity__ binds to two sites in the Ly-49a:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ and regulates its activity , suggesting that the Ly-49a:__entity__ gene:__entity__ is a direct TCF-1:__entity__ target .
TCF-1:__entity__ deficiency resulted in the altered usage of additional Ly-49:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ .
We show in this study , using TCF-1:__entity__ beta:__entity__ (:__entity__ 2:__entity__ ):__entity__ -microglobulin:__entity__ double-deficient mice , that these repertoire alterations are not due to Ly-49/MHC class I interactions .
Our findings rather suggest a TCF-1:__entity__ -dependent , cell autonomous effect on the acquisition of multiple Ly-49:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ .
Besides reduced receptor usage ( Ly-49A:__entity__ and:__entity__ D:__entity__ ) , we also observed no effect ( Ly-49C:__entity__ ) and significantly expanded ( Ly-49G:__entity__ and:__entity__ I:__entity__ ) receptor usage in the absence of TCF-1:__entity__ .
These effects did not in all cases correlate with the presence of TCF:__entity__ binding:__entity__ sites:__entity__ in the respective proximal:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ .
Therefore , besides TCF-1:__entity__ binding to the proximal:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ , Ly-49 acquisition may also be regulated by TCF-1:__entity__ binding to more distant cis-acting:__entity__ elements:__entity__ and/or by regulating the expression of additional trans-acting:__entity__ factors:__entity__ .
Consistent with the observed differential , positive or negative role of TCF-1:__entity__ for Ly-49:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ acquisition , reporter gene assays revealed the presence of an inducing as well as a repressing TCF:__entity__ site:__entity__ in certain proximal Ly-49:__entity__ promoters:__entity__ .
These findings reveal an important role of TCF-1:__entity__ for the formation of the NK:__entity__ cell:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ repertoire .
Ligation of CD11b:__entity__ and CD11c:__entity__ beta:__entity__ (:__entity__ 2:__entity__ ):__entity__ integrins:__entity__ by antibodies:__entity__ or soluble:__entity__ CD23:__entity__ induces macrophage:__entity__ inflammatory:__entity__ protein:__entity__ 1alpha:__entity__ ( MIP-1alpha:__entity__ ) and MIP-1beta:__entity__ production in primary human monocytes through a pathway dependent on nuclear:__entity__ factor-kappaB:__entity__ .
Chemokines:__entity__ and adhesion:__entity__ molecules:__entity__ such as integrins:__entity__ play a major part in the trafficking , extravasation , and recruitment of leukocytes to inflammatory sites .
This study investigated the effects of beta ( 2 ) integrin engagement on chemokine production by freshly isolated human monocytes .
We found that ligation of CD11b:__entity__ or CD11c:__entity__ but not CD11a:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ chains:__entity__ of beta:__entity__ (:__entity__ 2:__entity__ ):__entity__ integrins:__entity__ by antibodies:__entity__ or soluble:__entity__ CD23:__entity__ (:__entity__ sCD23:__entity__ ):__entity__ fusion:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ rapidly induced transcription and secretion of interleukin:__entity__ 8:__entity__ , macrophage:__entity__ inflammatory:__entity__ protein:__entity__ (:__entity__ MIP:__entity__ ):__entity__ 1alpha:__entity__ , and MIP-1beta:__entity__ .
Because the promoters:__entity__ of these chemokine:__entity__ genes:__entity__ contain kappaB:__entity__ binding:__entity__ sites:__entity__ , we assessed the possible role of nuclear:__entity__ factor-kappaB:__entity__ ( NF-kappaB:__entity__ ) in controlling induction of the genes through beta ( 2 ) integrin engagement .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that sCD23:__entity__ or antibodies:__entity__ to CD11b:__entity__ or to CD11c:__entity__ up-regulated DNA-binding activity of NF-kappaB:__entity__ .
Activation of NF-kappaB:__entity__ was accompanied by degradation of its cytosolic:__entity__ inhibitor:__entity__ IkappaB-alpha:__entity__ .
Blockade of depletion of IkappaB-alpha:__entity__ by proteasome inhibitors ( proteasome inhibitor I or acetyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-norleucinal ) led to concomitant inhibition of NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity and expression of MIP-1alpha:__entity__ and:__entity__ MIP-1beta:__entity__ messenger:__entity__ RNA:__entity__ induced by beta ( 2 ) integrin ligation .
These results suggest that triggering of CD11b:__entity__ or CD11c:__entity__ beta:__entity__ (:__entity__ 2:__entity__ ):__entity__ integrin on primary human monocytes provides activation signals leading to nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB:__entity__ and subsequent secretion of MIP-1alpha:__entity__ and MIP-1beta:__entity__ that may have an important role in recruitment of other inflammatory cells during initiation of an inflammatory response
Synergistic transcriptional activation of human:__entity__ Acyl-coenzyme:__entity__ A:__entity__ ::__entity__ cholesterol:__entity__ acyltransterase-1:__entity__ gene:__entity__ by interferon-gamma:__entity__ and all-trans-retinoic acid THP-1 cells .
Acyl-coenzyme:__entity__ A:__entity__ ::__entity__ cholesterol:__entity__ acyltransferase:__entity__ ( ACAT:__entity__ ) is an intracellular:__entity__ enzyme:__entity__ involved in cellular cholesterol homeostasis and in atherosclerotic foam cell formation .
Human:__entity__ ACAT-1:__entity__ gene:__entity__ contains two promoters:__entity__ ( P1:__entity__ and P7:__entity__ ) , each located in a different chromosome:__entity__ (:__entity__ 1:__entity__ and:__entity__ 7:__entity__ ):__entity__ ( Li , B. L. , Li , X. L. , Duan , Z. J. , Lee , O. , Lin , S. , Ma , Z. M. , Chang , C. C. , Yang , X. Y. , Park , J. P. , Mohandas , T. K. , Noll , W. , Chan , L. , and Chang , T. Y. ( 1999 ) J. Biol Chem. 274 , 11060-11071 ) .
Interferon-gamma:__entity__ ( IFN-gamma:__entity__ ) , a cytokine:__entity__ that exerts many pro-atherosclerotic effects in vivo , causes up-regulation of ACAT-1:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ in human blood monocyte-derived macrophages and macrophage-like cells but not in other cell types .
To examine the molecular nature of this observation , we identified within the ACAT-1:__entity__ P1:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ a 159-base:__entity__ pair:__entity__ core:__entity__ region:__entity__ .
This region contains 4 Sp1:__entity__ elements:__entity__ and an IFN-gamma:__entity__ activated:__entity__ sequence:__entity__ ( GAS:__entity__ ) that overlaps with the second Sp1:__entity__ element:__entity__ .
In the monocytic cell line THP-1 cell , the combination of IFN-gamma:__entity__ and all-trans-retinoic acid ( a known differentiation agent ) enhances the ACAT-1:__entity__ P1:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ but not the P7:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ .
Additional experiments showed that all-trans-retinoic acid causes large induction of the transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ STAT1:__entity__ , while IFN-gamma:__entity__ causes activation of STAT1:__entity__ such that it binds to the GAS/Sp1:__entity__ site:__entity__ in the ACAT-1:__entity__ P1:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ .
Our work provides a molecular mechanism to account for the effect of IFN-gamma:__entity__ in causing transcriptional activation of ACAT-1:__entity__ in macrophage-like cells .
Inhaled nitric oxide down-regulates intrapulmonary nitric oxide production in lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury .
OBJECTIVE : To examine whether inhaled nitric oxide ( NO ) affected the intrapulmonary production of NO , reactive oxygen species , and nuclear:__entity__ factor-kappaB:__entity__ in a lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -induced model of acute lung injury .
DESIGN : Prospective , randomized , laboratory study .
SETTING : Experimental laboratory at a biomedical institute .
SUBJECTS : Twenty male rabbits weighing 2.5-3.5 kg .
INTERVENTIONS : Saline or LPS ( 5 mg/kg of body weight ) was administered intravenously with or without NO inhalation ( 10 ppm ) in each group of five rabbits .
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS : LPS increased the lung leak index , the neutrophils and NO levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid , and NO levels produced by resting and stimulated alveolar macrophages .
Inhaled NO decreased the lung leak index , the neutrophils and NO levels as measured by nitrite levels in the lavage fluid , and NO produced by the resting and stimulated alveolar macrophages .
Inhaled NO also blocked the activities of reactive oxygen species and nuclear:__entity__ factor-kappaB:__entity__ binding to DNA in lavage cells and in alveolar macrophages .
CONCLUSION : Inhaled NO attenuates LPS-induced acute lung injury , possibly by decreasing NO production in the lungs .
The mechanism of reducing NO production resulting from inhaled NO may involve , in part , the activities of reactive oxygen species and/or nuclear:__entity__ factor-kappaB:__entity__ .
Treatment of allergic airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness by antisense-induced local blockade of GATA-3:__entity__ expression .
Recent studies in transgenic mice have revealed that expression of a dominant negative form of the transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ GATA-3:__entity__ in T cells can prevent T helper cell type 2 ( Th2 ) -mediated allergic airway inflammation in mice .
However , it remains unclear whether GATA-3:__entity__ plays a role in the effector phase of allergic airway inflammation and whether antagonizing the expression and/or function of GATA-3:__entity__ can be used for the therapy of allergic airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness .
Here , we analyzed the effects of locally antagonizing GATA-3:__entity__ function in a murine model of asthma .
We could suppress GATA-3 expression in interleukin:__entity__ (:__entity__ IL:__entity__ ):__entity__ -4:__entity__ -producing T cells in vitro and in vivo by an antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotide overlapping the translation:__entity__ start:__entity__ site:__entity__ of GATA-3:__entity__ , whereas nonsense control oligonucleotides were virtually inactive .
In a murine model of asthma associated with allergic pulmonary inflammation and hyperresponsiveness in ovalbumin ( OVA ) -sensitized mice , local intranasal administration of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled GATA-3 antisense oligonucleotides led to DNA uptake in lung cells associated with a reduction of intracellular GATA-3 expression .
Such intrapulmonary blockade of GATA-3 expression caused an abrogation of signs of lung inflammation including infiltration of eosinophils and Th2 cytokine production .
Furthermore , treatment with antisense but not nonsense oligonucleotides induced a significant reduction of airway hyperresponsiveness in OVA-sensitized mice to levels comparable to saline-treated control mice , as assessed by both enhanced pause ( PenH ) responses and pulmonary resistance determined by body plethysmography .
These data indicate a critical role for GATA-3:__entity__ in the effector phase of a murine asthma model and suggest that local delivery of GATA-3 antisense oligonucleotides may be a novel approach for the treatment of airway hyperresponsiveness such as in asthma .
This approach has the potential advantage of suppressing the expression of various proinflammatory:__entity__ Th2:__entity__ cytokines:__entity__ simultaneously rather than suppressing the activity of a single cytokine:__entity__ .
T helper-cell phenotype regulates atherosclerosis in mice under conditions of mild hypercholesterolemia .
BACKGROUND : T cells are implicated in atherosclerosis , but little is known about the genetic control or molecular pathways , especially under conditions of mild hypercholesterolemia .
METHODS AND RESULTS : BALB/c mice , making a CD4+ Th2 ( IL-4+ ) cell response , express both MHC:__entity__ class:__entity__ II:__entity__ antigens:__entity__ ( IA:__entity__ (:__entity__ d:__entity__ ):__entity__ , IE:__entity__ (:__entity__ d:__entity__ ):__entity__ ) and are atherosclerosis-resistant .
C57Bl/6 mice produce a CD4+ Th1 ( interferon [ IFN ] gamma+ ) response , express IA:__entity__ (:__entity__ b:__entity__ ):__entity__ but no IE:__entity__ , and are atherosclerosis-prone .
To evaluate T helper-cell phenotype in fatty streak formation , wild-type C57Bl/6 mice ( IA ( b ) +IE- ) and transgenic mice , either AB ( o ) , IA ( b ) -IE- ; ABEalpha , IA-IE ( k ) + ; or BL : TG : Ealpha , IA ( b ) +IE ( k ) + , were fed a high-cholesterol diet for 16 weeks and evaluated histomorphometrically for aortic lesions .
Lesion size in AB ( o ) , ABEalpha , and BL : TG : Ealpha strains was decreased by 54 % , 79 % , and 82 % , respectively , compared with wild-type , correlating with decreased Th1 and increased Th2 expression and suggesting that T helper-cell phenotype is important in fatty lesion development .
Decreasing Th1 cells by antibodies:__entity__ ( alpha-CD4:__entity__ ) or cytokines:__entity__ ( IL-4:__entity__ ) also caused > /=80 % reductions in lesion size .
Immunohistology revealed IFN-gamma:__entity__ , but not IL-4:__entity__ , colocalized with activated macrophages .
Confirming these findings in a different mouse strain , BALB/c Stat 6 knockout mice ( Th2 cell-deficient ) developed aortic lesions comparable to C57Bl/6 mice on the same diet .
CONCLUSIONS : In mildly hypercholesterolemic C57Bl/6 mice , presence of IA:__entity__ (:__entity__ b:__entity__ ):__entity__ and absence of IE:__entity__ regulated CD4+ T helper-cell phenotype ; fatty lesions were proportional to IFNgamma+ Th1 cells in both C57Bl/6 and BALB/c strains .
IFN-gamma:__entity__ may participate through macrophage activation , whereas IL-4:__entity__ may act to limit Th1-cell response .
Requirement for p38:__entity__ and p44/p42:__entity__ mitogen-activated:__entity__ protein:__entity__ kinases:__entity__ in RAGE:__entity__ -mediated nuclear:__entity__ factor-kappaB:__entity__ transcriptional activation and cytokine secretion .
Advanced glycation end product ( AGE ) activation of the signal-transducing:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ for:__entity__ AGE:__entity__ ( RAGE:__entity__ ) has been linked to a proinflammatory phenotypic change within cells .
However , the precise intracellular signaling pathways involved have not been elucidated .
We demonstrate here that human serum albumin modified with N ( varepsilon ) - ( carboxymethyl ) lysine ( CML ) , a major AGE adduct that progressively accumulates with aging , diabetes , and renal failure , induced nuclear:__entity__ factor:__entity__ (:__entity__ NF:__entity__ ):__entity__ -kappaB:__entity__ -driven reporter gene expression in human monocytic THP-1 cells .
The NF-kappaB response was blocked with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the putative:__entity__ ligand-binding:__entity__ domain:__entity__ of RAGE:__entity__ , with anti- RAGE:__entity__ antiserum , and by coexpression of truncated:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ lacking the intracellular:__entity__ domain:__entity__ .
Signal transduction from RAGE:__entity__ to NF-kappaB:__entity__ involved the generation of reactive oxygen species , since reporter gene expression was blocked with the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine .
CML-modified:__entity__ albumin:__entity__ produced rapid transient activation of tyrosine phosphorylation , extracellular:__entity__ signal-regulated:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ 1:__entity__ and:__entity__ 2:__entity__ , and p38:__entity__ mitogen-activated:__entity__ protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ ( MAPK:__entity__ ) , but not c-Jun:__entity__ NH:__entity__ (:__entity__ 2:__entity__ ):__entity__ -terminal:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ .
RAGE:__entity__ -mediated NF-kappaB activation was suppressed by the selective p38:__entity__ MAPK:__entity__ inhibitor SB203580 and by coexpression of a kinase-dead p38 dominant-negative mutant .
Activation of NF-kappaB:__entity__ by CML-modified:__entity__ albumin:__entity__ increased secretion of proinflammatory:__entity__ cytokines:__entity__ ( tumor:__entity__ necrosis:__entity__ factor-alpha:__entity__ , interleukin-1beta:__entity__ , and monocyte:__entity__ chemoattractant:__entity__ protein-1:__entity__ ) severalfold , and inhibition of p38:__entity__ MAPK:__entity__ blocked these increases .
These results indicate that p38:__entity__ MAPK:__entity__ activation mediates RAGE:__entity__ -induced NF-kappaB:__entity__ -dependent secretion of proinflammatory:__entity__ cytokines:__entity__ and suggest that accelerated inflammation may be a consequence of cellular activation induced by this receptor .
Antigen-receptor cross-linking and lipopolysaccharide trigger distinct phosphoinositide:__entity__ 3-kinase:__entity__ -dependent pathways to NF-kappa B activation in primary B cells .
The NF-kappaB/Rel:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ play an important role in the expression of genes involved in B cell development , differentiation and function .
Nuclear:__entity__ NF-kappaB:__entity__ is induced in B cells by engagement of either the BCR:__entity__ or CD40:__entity__ or by stimulation with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) .
Despite the importance of NF-kappaB:__entity__ to B cell function , little is known about the signaling pathways leading to NF-kappaB activation .
In this report we address the role of phosphoinositide:__entity__ 3'-kinase:__entity__ ( PI:__entity__ 3-kinase:__entity__ ) in BCR:__entity__ - and LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation using populations of primary murine resting B cells .
Using the specific pharmacological inhibitors of PI:__entity__ 3-kinase:__entity__ , Wortmannin and LY294002 , we demonstrate that PI:__entity__ 3-kinase:__entity__ activity is vital for BCR:__entity__ -induced NF-kappaB:__entity__ DNA-binding activity .
Furthermore , we show that this is achieved via protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ C:__entity__ -dependent degradation of IkappaBalpha:__entity__ .
Similar analyses reveal that PI:__entity__ 3-kinase:__entity__ is also critical in triggering NF-kappaB:__entity__ DNA-binding activity and IkappaBalpha:__entity__ degradation following LPS stimulation .
Interestingly , a PKC inhibitor which blocked the BCR:__entity__ -induced IkappaBalpha:__entity__ degradation had no effect on the degradation of IkappaBalpha:__entity__ after LPS stimulation .
Taken together , our results indicate the involvement of PI:__entity__ 3-kinase:__entity__ in at least two distinct signaling pathways leading to activation of NF-kappaB:__entity__ in B cells .
Tetramer-guided epitope mapping : rapid identification and characterization of immunodominant CD4+ T cell epitopes from complex antigens:__entity__ .
T cell responses to Ags:__entity__ involve recognition of selected peptide:__entity__ epitopes:__entity__ contained within the antigenic:__entity__ protein:__entity__ .
In this report , we describe a new approach for direct identification of CD4+ T cell epitopes of complex Ags:__entity__ that uses human:__entity__ class:__entity__ II:__entity__ tetramers:__entity__ to identify reactive cells .
With a panel of 60 overlapping peptides covering the entire sequence of the VP16:__entity__ protein:__entity__ , a major Ag:__entity__ for HSV-2 , we generated a panel of class:__entity__ II:__entity__ MHC:__entity__ tetramers:__entity__ loaded with peptide pools that were used to stain peripheral lymphocytes of an HSV-2 infected individual .
With this approach , we identified four new DRA1*0101/DRB1*0401- and two DRA1*0101/DRB1*0404-restricted , VP16-specific:__entity__ epitopes:__entity__ .
By using tetramers:__entity__ to sort individual cells , we easily obtained a large number of clones specific to these epitopes:__entity__ .
Although DRA1*0101/DRB1*0401 and DRA1*0101/DRB1*0404 are structurally very similar , nonoverlapping VP16:__entity__ epitopes:__entity__ were identified , illustrating high selectivity of individual allele polymorphisms within common MHC variants .
This rapid approach to detecting CD4+ T cell epitopes from complex Ags:__entity__ can be applied to any known Ag:__entity__ that gives a T cell response .
Localized pancreatic NF-kappaB activation and inflammatory response in taurocholate-induced pancreatitis .
Transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ nuclear:__entity__ factor-kappaB:__entity__ ( NF-kappaB:__entity__ ) is activated in cerulein pancreatitis and mediates cytokine expression .
The role of transcription factor activation in other models of pancreatitis has not been established .
Here we report upregulation of NF-kappaB:__entity__ and inflammatory:__entity__ molecules:__entity__ , and their correlation with local pancreatic injury , in a model of severe pancreatitis .
Rats received intraductal infusion of taurocholate or saline , and the pancreatic head and tail were analyzed separately .
NF-kappaB:__entity__ and activator:__entity__ protein-1:__entity__ ( AP-1:__entity__ ) activation were assessed by gel shift assay , and mRNA expression of interleukin-6:__entity__ , tumor:__entity__ necrosis:__entity__ factor-alpha:__entity__ , KC , monocyte:__entity__ chemoattractant:__entity__ protein-1:__entity__ , and inducible:__entity__ nitric:__entity__ oxide:__entity__ synthase:__entity__ was assessed by semiquantitative RT-PCR .
Morphological damage and trypsin activation were much greater in the pancreatic head than tail , in parallel with a stronger activation of NF-kappaB:__entity__ and:__entity__ cytokine:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ .
Saline infusion mildly affected these parameters .
AP-1:__entity__ was strongly activated in both pancreatic segments after either taurocholate or saline infusion .
NF-kappaB:__entity__ inhibition with N-acetylcysteine ameliorated the local inflammatory response .
Correlation between localized NF-kappaB:__entity__ activation , cytokine upregulation , and tissue damage suggests a key role for NF-kappaB:__entity__ in the development of the inflammatory response of acute pancreatitis .
CD45:__entity__ tyrosine:__entity__ phosphatase:__entity__ controls common gamma-chain:__entity__ cytokine:__entity__ -mediated STAT:__entity__ and extracellular signal-related kinase phosphorylation in activated human lymphoblasts : inhibition of proliferation without induction of apoptosis .
The objective of this study was to test whether CD45 signals can influence signaling processes in activated human lymphoblasts .
To this end , we generated lymphoblasts which proliferate in response to common gamma-chain:__entity__ cytokines:__entity__ , but readily undergo apoptosis after cytokine withdrawal .
In experiments with the CD45R0:__entity__ mAb:__entity__ UCHL-1:__entity__ , but not control:__entity__ CD45:__entity__ mAbs:__entity__ , we found significant inhibition of proliferation .
Interestingly , the pan-CD45:__entity__ mAb:__entity__ GAP8.3:__entity__ , which is most effective in inhibition of OKT-3-mediated proliferation in quiescent lymphocytes , was ineffective in lymphoblasts .
Addition of CD3:__entity__ mAb:__entity__ OKT-3:__entity__ had no influence on IL-2-mediated proliferation ( with or without UCHL-1:__entity__ ) .
In contrast , after addition of OKT-3:__entity__ to IL-4:__entity__ - and IL-7:__entity__ -stimulated proliferation assays , UCHL-1:__entity__ signals could not significantly alter cellular proliferation .
We did not find induction of apoptosis following CD45R0 signaling .
In Western blots using mAbs:__entity__ detecting phosphorylated:__entity__ STAT-3:__entity__ ,:__entity__ STAT-5:__entity__ ,:__entity__ STAT-6:__entity__ , or extracellular:__entity__ signal-related:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ 1/2:__entity__ , we found that CD45R0 signaling could effectively diminish phosphorylation of these intracellular signaling components .
Using RT-PCR , we found that CD45R0 signaling inhibited IL-2 mRNA production without major influence on IL-13:__entity__ , IL-5:__entity__ , or IFN-gamma:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ levels .
Costimulation with OKT-3:__entity__ and IL-2:__entity__ optimally induced secretion of IFN-gamma:__entity__ , TNF-alpha:__entity__ , and IL-5:__entity__ , which was not decreased by CD45 signals .
In conclusion , we illustrate that CD45R0 signals control early cytokine receptor-associated signaling processes and mRNA and DNA synthesis in activated human lymphoblasts .
Furthermore , we show the existence of CD45:__entity__ epitopes:__entity__ ( GAP8.3:__entity__ ) , which are active and critical for signaling in quiescent lymphocytes , but are nonfunctional in activated human lymphoblasts .
Pax5:__entity__ determines the identity of B cells from the beginning to the end of B-lymphopoiesis .
Despite being one of the most intensively studied cell types , the molecular basis of B cell specification is largely unknown .
The Pax5:__entity__ gene:__entity__ encoding the transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ BSAP:__entity__ is required for progression of B-lymphopoiesis beyond the pro-B cell stage .
Pax5-deficient pro-B cells are , however , not yet committed to the B-lymphoid lineage , but instead have a broad lymphomyeloid developmental potential .
Pax5:__entity__ appears to mediate B-lineage commitment by repressing the transcription of non-B-lymphoid:__entity__ genes:__entity__ and by simultaneously activating the expression of B-lineage-specific:__entity__ genes:__entity__ .
Pax5:__entity__ thus functions both as a transcriptional repressor and activator , depending on its interactions with corepressors:__entity__ of the Groucho:__entity__ protein:__entity__ family:__entity__ or with positive regulators such as the TATA-binding:__entity__ protein:__entity__ .
Once committed to the B-lineage , B cells require Pax5:__entity__ function to maintain their B-lymphoid identity throughout B cell development
Partners in transcription : NFAT:__entity__ and AP-1:__entity__ .
Combinatorial regulation is a powerful mechanism that enables tight control of gene expression , via integration of multiple signaling pathways that induce different transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ required for enhanceosome assembly .
The four calcium-regulated transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ of the NFAT:__entity__ family:__entity__ act synergistically with AP-1:__entity__ (:__entity__ Fos/Jun:__entity__ ):__entity__ proteins:__entity__ on composite DNA elements which contain adjacent NFAT:__entity__ and:__entity__ AP-1:__entity__ binding:__entity__ sites:__entity__ , where they form highly stable ternary complexes to regulate the expression of diverse inducible genes .
Concomitant induction of NFAT:__entity__ and AP-1:__entity__ requires concerted activation of two different signaling pathways : calcium/calcineurin , which promotes NFAT dephosphorylation , nuclear translocation and activation ; and protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ C:__entity__ (:__entity__ PKC:__entity__ ):__entity__ /Ras:__entity__ , which promotes the synthesis , phosphorylation and activation of members of the Fos:__entity__ and:__entity__ Jun:__entity__ families:__entity__ of transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ .
A fifth member of the NFAT:__entity__ family:__entity__ , NFAT5:__entity__ , controls the cellular response to osmotic stress , by a mechanism that requires dimer formation and is independent of calcineurin:__entity__ or of interaction with AP-1:__entity__ .
Pharmacological interference with theNFAT : AP-1 interaction may be useful in selective manipulation of the immune response .
Balanced activation of NFAT:__entity__ and AP-1:__entity__ is known to be required for productive immune responses , but the role of NFAT : AP-1 interactions in other cell types and biological processes remains to be understood .
Cytokine production by Vgamma ( + ) -T-cell subsets is an important factor determining CD4 ( + ) -Th-cell phenotype and susceptibility of BALB/c mice to coxsackievirus B3-induced myocarditis .
Two coxsackievirus B3 ( CVB3 ) variants ( H3 and H310A1 ) differ by a single amino acid mutation in the VP2:__entity__ capsid:__entity__ protein:__entity__ .
H3 induces severe myocarditis in BALB/c mice , but H310A1 is amyocarditic .
Infection with H3 , but not H310A1 , preferentially activates Vgamma4 Vdelta4 cells , which are strongly positive for gamma:__entity__ interferon:__entity__ ( IFN-gamma:__entity__ ) , whereas Vgamma1 Vdelta4 cells are increased in both H3 and H310A1 virus-infected animals .
Depletion of Vgamma1 ( + ) cells using monoclonal:__entity__ anti-Vgamma1:__entity__ antibody:__entity__ enhanced myocarditis and CD4 ( + ) - , IFN-gamma:__entity__ ( + ) -cell responses in both H3- and H310A1-infected mice yet decreased the CD4 ( + ) - , IL-4 ( + ) -cell response .
Depleting Vgamma4 ( + ) cells suppressed myocarditis and reduced CD4 ( + ) IFN-gamma ( + ) cells but increased CD4 ( + ) IL-4 ( + ) T cells .
The role of cytokine production by Vgamma1 ( + ) and Vgamma4 ( + ) T cells was investigated by adoptively transferring these cells isolated from H3-infected BALB/c Stat4 knockout ( Stat4ko ) ( defective in IFN-gamma:__entity__ expression ) or BALB/c Stat6ko ( defective in IL-4 expression ) mice into H3 virus-infected wild-type BALB/c recipients .
Vgamma4 and Vgamma1 ( + ) T cells from Stat4ko mice expressed IL-4:__entity__ but no or minimal IFN-gamma:__entity__ , whereas these cell populations derived from Stat6ko mice expressed IFN-gamma:__entity__ but no IL-4:__entity__ .
Stat4ko Vgamma1 ( + ) cells ( IL-4 ( + ) ) suppress myocarditis .
Stat6ko Vgamma1 ( + ) cells ( IFN-gamma ( + ) ) were not inhibitory .
Stat6ko Vgamma4 ( + ) cells ( IFN-gamma ( + ) ) significantly enhanced myocarditis .
Stat4ko Vgamma4 ( + ) cells ( IL-4 ( + ) ) neither inhibited nor enhanced disease .
These results show that distinct gammadelta-T-cell subsets control myocarditis susceptibility and bias the CD4 ( + ) -Th-cell response .
The cytokines:__entity__ produced by the Vgamma subpopulation have a significant influence on the CD4:__entity__ ( + ) -Th-cell phenotype .
Plasmin:__entity__ -induced expression of cytokines:__entity__ and tissue:__entity__ factor:__entity__ in human monocytes involves AP-1:__entity__ and IKKbeta:__entity__ -mediated NF-kappaB activation .
It was previously shown that plasmin:__entity__ activates human peripheral monocytes in terms of lipid mediator release and chemotactic migration .
Here it is demonstrated that plasmin:__entity__ induces proinflammatory:__entity__ cytokine:__entity__ release and tissue:__entity__ factor:__entity__ ( TF:__entity__ ) expression by monocytes .
Plasmin:__entity__ 0.043 to 1.43 CTA U/mL , but not active:__entity__ site-blocked:__entity__ plasmin:__entity__ , triggered concentration-dependent expression of mRNA for interleukin-1alpha:__entity__ ( IL-1alpha:__entity__ ) , IL-1beta:__entity__ , tumor:__entity__ necrosis:__entity__ factor-alpha:__entity__ ( TNF-alpha:__entity__ ) , and TF:__entity__ with maximum responses after 4 hours .
Plasmin:__entity__ -mediated mRNA expression was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by the lysine analogue trans-4- ( aminomethyl ) cyclohexane-1-carboxylic acid ( t-AMCA ) .
Increases in mRNA levels were followed by concentration- and time-dependent release of IL-1alpha:__entity__ , IL-1beta:__entity__ and TNF-alpha:__entity__ and by TF:__entity__ expression on monocyte surfaces .
Neither cytokines:__entity__ nor TF:__entity__ could be detected when monocytes were preincubated with actinomycin D or cycloheximide .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated plasmin:__entity__ -induced activation of NF-kappaB:__entity__ ; DNA-binding:__entity__ complexes:__entity__ were composed of p50:__entity__ , p65:__entity__ , and c-Rel:__entity__ , as shown by supershift experiments .
Nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB/Rel:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ coincided with IkappaBalpha degradation .
At variance with endotoxic lipopolysaccharide , plasmin:__entity__ elicited the rapid degradation of another cytoplasmic:__entity__ NF-kappaB:__entity__ inhibitor:__entity__ ,:__entity__ p105:__entity__ .
Proteolysis of NF-kappaB inhibitors was apparently due to transient activation of IkappaB:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ (:__entity__ IKK:__entity__ ):__entity__ beta:__entity__ that reached maximum activity at 1 hour after plasmin:__entity__ stimulation .
In addition , AP-1 binding was increased in plasmin:__entity__ -treated monocytes , with most complexes composed of JunD:__entity__ , c-Fos:__entity__ , and FosB:__entity__ .
These findings further substantiate the role of plasmin:__entity__ as a proinflammatory activator of human monocytes and reveal an important new link between the plasminogen-plasmin system and inflammation .

STAT3:__entity__ is constitutively active in some patients with Polycythemia rubra vera .
OBJECTIVE : Polycythemia vera is a clonal stem cell disorder characterized by hyperproliferation of the erythroid , myeloid , and megakaryocytic lineages .
While it has been shown that progenitor cells of P. vera patients are hypersensitive to several growth factors including erythropoietin:__entity__ , insulin-like:__entity__ growth:__entity__ factor-1:__entity__ , thrombopoietin:__entity__ , interleukin-3:__entity__ , and granulocyte/monocyte:__entity__ colony-stimulating:__entity__ factor:__entity__ , the molecular pathogenesis of this disease remains unknown .
Growth factor hypersensitivity could be mediated by changes in signal transduction pathways .
We therefore investigated a common downstream effector of cytokines:__entity__ , the signal:__entity__ transducers:__entity__ and:__entity__ activators:__entity__ of:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ ( STATs:__entity__ ) .
A constitutive activation of STAT:__entity__ factors:__entity__ could explain the increased proliferation of P. vera cells even in the absence of growth factor stimulation .
METHODS : Peripheral granulocytes from patients with P. vera and from healthy volunteers were assayed for STAT1:__entity__ ,:__entity__ 3:__entity__ ,:__entity__ and:__entity__ 5:__entity__ DNA binding by electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
RESULTS : Four of 14 P. vera patients analyzed showed constitutive STAT3 DNA binding in unstimulated peripheral granulocytes , while none of the 17 healthy volunteers tested did .
None of the subjects showed constitutive STAT1:__entity__ or STAT5:__entity__ activity .
Western blotting demonstrated that , in the three patients , STAT3:__entity__ is constitutively phosphorylated on Tyr 705 , whereas it is unphosphorylated in the other patients and in controls .
Interestingly , constitutive STAT3:__entity__ activity did not correlate with the duration of disease or the treatment regimen .
It was observed in a recently diagnosed patient and in two patients treated only with phlebotomy .
CONCLUSION : Our data suggest that constitutive phosphorylation and activation of STAT3:__entity__ is not a secondary event induced by mutagenizing agents or by prolonged hyperproliferation of hematopoietic cells , but rather represents a primary molecular aberration .
Constitutively:__entity__ active:__entity__ STAT3:__entity__ may contribute to the growth factor hypersensitivity of P. vera cells .
Identification of phosphorylation:__entity__ sites:__entity__ for Bruton:__entity__ 's:__entity__ tyrosine:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ within the transcriptional:__entity__ regulator:__entity__ BAP/TFII-I:__entity__ .
Bruton:__entity__ 's:__entity__ tyrosine:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ ( Btk:__entity__ ) , a member of the Tec:__entity__ family:__entity__ of:__entity__ cytosolic:__entity__ kinases:__entity__ , is essential for B cell development and function .
BAP/TFII-I:__entity__ , a protein implicated in transcriptional regulation , is associated with Btk:__entity__ in B cells and is transiently phosphorylated on tyrosine following B cell receptor engagement .
BAP/TFII-I:__entity__ is a substrate for Btk:__entity__ in vitro and is hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine upon coexpression with Btk:__entity__ in mammalian cells .
In an effort to understand the physiologic consequences of BAP/TFII-I:__entity__ tyrosine phosphorylation following B cell receptor stimulation , site-directed mutagenesis and phosphopeptide mapping were used to locate the predominant sites of BAP/TFII-I:__entity__ phosphorylation by Btk:__entity__ in vitro .
These residues , Tyr248 , Tyr357 , and Tyr462 , were also found to be the major sites for Btk:__entity__ -dependent phosphorylation of BAP/TFII-I:__entity__ in vivo .
Residues Tyr357 and Tyr462 are contained within the loop:__entity__ regions:__entity__ of adjacent helix-loop-helix-like:__entity__ repeats:__entity__ within BAP/TFII-I:__entity__ .
Mutation of either Tyr248 , Tyr357 , or Tyr462 to phenylalanine reduced transcription from a c-fos:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ relative to wild-type:__entity__ BAP/TFII-I:__entity__ in transfected COS-7 cells , consistent with the interpretation that phosphorylation at these sites contributes to transcriptional activation .
Phosphorylation of BAP/TFII-I:__entity__ by Btk:__entity__ may link engagement of receptors such as surface immunoglobulin:__entity__ to modulation of gene expression .
Expression of interferon:__entity__ consensus:__entity__ sequence:__entity__ binding:__entity__ protein:__entity__ induces potent immunity against BCR/ABL-induced leukemia .
Mice deficient in the interferon:__entity__ consensus:__entity__ sequence:__entity__ binding:__entity__ protein:__entity__ ( ICSBP:__entity__ ) develop a disease resembling chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) , which in humans is caused by the BCR/ABL:__entity__ oncoprotein:__entity__ .
Interferon-alpha:__entity__ ( IFN-alpha:__entity__ ) induces ICSBP:__entity__ expression and is an effective therapy for CML .
This study examined whether enforced expression of ICSBP:__entity__ might antagonize BCR/ABL-induced leukemia ; results demonstrated that ICSBP-modified cells generated a protective CD8 ( + ) cytotoxic T-cell response against BCR/ABL-transformed BaF3 cells in a murine leukemia model .
ICSBP:__entity__ expression represents a novel means of stimulating a host immune response to BCR/ABL ( + ) leukemia cells and a potential strategy for immunotherapy of CML .

A transcriptional block in the IL-2:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ at the -150:__entity__ AP-1:__entity__ site:__entity__ in effector CD8+ T cells .
Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that produce IL-2:__entity__ in response to Ag recognition have been isolated .
However , most effector CD8+ T cells recovered after exposure to Ag:__entity__ do not produce sufficient IL-2:__entity__ to sustain growth , and depend on CD4+ T helper cells for this obligate growth factor .
IL-2 expression in CD4+ T cells is primarily controlled at the level of transcription , but mechanisms restricting IL-2 production in CD8+ T cells have not been elucidated .
To evaluate transcriptional regulation of the IL-2:__entity__ gene:__entity__ in CD8+ T cells , we stably transfected reporter:__entity__ genes:__entity__ into Ag:__entity__ -specific CD8+ T cell clones .
CD28+ CD8 ( + ) T cells unable to transcribe the IL-2:__entity__ gene:__entity__ in response to antigenic stimulation had a block in transactivation of the -150:__entity__ CD28:__entity__ response:__entity__ element:__entity__ (:__entity__ CD28RE:__entity__ ):__entity__ /AP-1:__entity__ site:__entity__ of the IL-2:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ , but did transactivate the composite NFAT/AP-1:__entity__ and:__entity__ OCT/AP-1:__entity__ sites:__entity__ , and a consensus:__entity__ AP-1:__entity__ motif:__entity__ .
Mutation of the nonconsensus:__entity__ -150:__entity__ AP-1:__entity__ site:__entity__ to a consensus:__entity__ AP-1:__entity__ site:__entity__ , or insertion of a CD28RE/AP-1:__entity__ consensus:__entity__ site:__entity__ upstream of the native -150:__entity__ CD28RE/AP-1:__entity__ site:__entity__ restored transactivation of the altered promoter:__entity__ .
These results suggest that the defect at the -150:__entity__ site:__entity__ may reflect the absence or inactivity of a required factor rather than repression of the IL-2:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ .
Stem:__entity__ cell:__entity__ factor:__entity__ and interleukin-3:__entity__ induce stepwise generation of erythroid precursor cells from a basic fibroblast:__entity__ growth:__entity__ factor:__entity__ -dependent hematopoietic stem cell line , A-6 .
A m ultipotent immature myeloid cell population was produced from a basic:__entity__ fibroblast:__entity__ growth:__entity__ factor:__entity__ ( bFGF:__entity__ ) -dependent hematopoietic stem cell line , A-6 , when cultured with stem:__entity__ cell:__entity__ factor:__entity__ ( SCF:__entity__ ) replacing bFGF:__entity__ .
Those cells were positive for stem:__entity__ cell:__entity__ markers:__entity__ , c-kit:__entity__ and CD34:__entity__ , and a myeloid:__entity__ cell:__entity__ marker:__entity__ ,:__entity__ F4/80:__entity__ .
Some cell fractions were also positive for Mac-1:__entity__ ,:__entity__ a:__entity__ macrophage:__entity__ marker:__entity__ or Gr-1:__entity__ ,:__entity__ a:__entity__ granulocytic:__entity__ maker:__entity__ , but negative for an erythroid:__entity__ marker:__entity__ TER119:__entity__ .
They also showed the expression of mRNA for the myeloid-specific:__entity__ PU.1:__entity__ but did not that for the erythroid-specific:__entity__ GATA-1:__entity__ .
Among various cytokines:__entity__ , interleukin-3:__entity__ ( IL-3:__entity__ ) induced erythroid precursor cells that expressed the erythroid-specific:__entity__ GATA-1:__entity__ and beta-major:__entity__ globin:__entity__ .
The quantitative analysis showed that erythroid precursor cells were newly produced from the immature myeloid cells by cultivation with IL-3:__entity__ .
SCF:__entity__ and IL-3:__entity__ induced stepwise generation of erythroid precursor cells from an A-6 hematopoietic stem cell line .

Distinct BMI-1:__entity__ and EZH2:__entity__ expression patterns in thymocytes and mature T cells suggest a role for Polycomb:__entity__ genes:__entity__ in human T cell differentiation .
BMI-1:__entity__ and EZH2:__entity__ Polycomb-group:__entity__ (:__entity__ PcG:__entity__ ):__entity__ proteins:__entity__ belong to two distinct protein complexes involved in the regulation of hematopoiesis .
Using unique PcG-specific antisera and triple immunofluorescence , we found that mature resting peripheral T cells expressed BMI-1:__entity__ , whereas dividing blasts were EZH2 ( + ) .
By contrast , subcapsular immature double-negative ( DN ) ( CD4 ( - ) /CD8 ( - ) ) T cells in the thymus coexpressed BMI-1:__entity__ and EZH2:__entity__ or were BMI-1 single positive .
Their descendants , double-positive ( DP ; CD4 ( + ) /CD8 ( + ) ) cortical thymocytes , expressed EZH2:__entity__ without BMI-1:__entity__ .
Most EZH2 ( + ) DN and DP thymocytes were dividing , while DN BMI-1 ( + ) /EZH2 ( - ) thymocytes were resting and proliferation was occasionally noted in DN BMI-1 ( + ) /EZH2 ( + ) cells .
Maturation of DP cortical thymocytes to single-positive ( CD4 ( + ) /CD8 ( - ) or CD8 ( + ) /CD4 ( - ) ) medullar thymocytes correlated with decreased detectability of EZH2:__entity__ and continued relative absence of BMI-1:__entity__ .
Our data show that BMI-1:__entity__ and EZH2:__entity__ expression in mature peripheral T cells is mutually exclusive and linked to proliferation status , and that this pattern is not yet established in thymocytes of the cortex and medulla .
T cell stage-specific PcG expression profiles suggest that PcG:__entity__ genes:__entity__ contribute to regulation of T cell differentiation .
They probably reflect stabilization of cell type-specific gene expression and irreversibility of lineage choice .
The difference in PcG expression between medullar thymocytes and mature interfollicular T cells indicates that additional maturation processes occur after thymocyte transportation from the thymus .
Stepwise lineage restriction of progenitors in lympho-myelopoiesis .
It has long been controversial whether hematopoiesis progresses through ordered stages of determination as in embryonic development .
This is due to the absence of a methodology capable of exactly determining the developmental potential of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells .
The multilineage progenitor ( MLP ) assay enabled us to discriminate among seven types of hematopoietic progenitors , which are multipotent progenitor p-MTB ( capable of generating myeloid , T and B cells ) , bipotent progenitors p-MT , p-MB and p-TB , and unipotent progenitors p-M , p-T and p-B .
Among these seven types , the p-TB type progenitor was found to be absent .
These findings indicate that the process of lineage commitment proceeds through an ordered but not random process .
By extending the area of investigation to include the erythroid lineage , more convincing evidence for the ordered process was obtained .
Detailed and exact illustration of the process of hematopoiesis will provide an opportunity to revive hematopoiesis as one of the most fascinating targets of research in developmental biology
Epstein-Barr Virus and its glycoprotein-350:__entity__ upregulate IL-6:__entity__ in human B-lymphocytes via CD21:__entity__ , involving activation of NF-kappaB:__entity__ and different signaling pathways .
Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) is a ubiquitous and highly immunotropic gamma herpesvirus that infects more than 90 % of humans worldwide .
Its pathogenicity leads to a number of diseases including tumors that result from EBV 's ability to readily transform B-lymphocytes and , to a lesser extent , epithelial cells .
EBV utilizes CD21/CR2:__entity__ as its receptor on B cells to initiate the infection process .
EBV binds to CR2:__entity__ through its major:__entity__ envelope:__entity__ glycoprotein-350:__entity__ ( gp350:__entity__ ) and is also a remarkable immunomodulating agent .
We had previously shown that EBV is capable of modulating the synthesis of a number of cytokines:__entity__ .
We now show that while both purified recombinant:__entity__ gp350:__entity__ ( rgp350:__entity__ ) and EBV upregulate IL-6:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ synthesis in B cells , EBV-induced IL-6 gene activation occurs for a significantly longer period of time ( i.e. 12 hours for EBV as compared to 6 hours for rgp350:__entity__ ) .
Moreover , the half-life of EBV-induced IL-6:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ was also significantly longer ( 10 hours ) than that of mRNA induced by rgp350:__entity__ ( about 6 hours ) .
Both EBV and gp350:__entity__ enhance the binding of the NF-kappaB:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ , as determined by band-shift and augment NF-kappaB:__entity__ -mediated activation of a CAT:__entity__ reporter:__entity__ plasmid:__entity__ .
Furthermore , we demonstrate that while the activation of IL-6 gene expression by gp350:__entity__ is mediated primarily by the protein kinase C pathway , EBV can mediate its effects through multiple signaling pathways .
To our knowledge this is the first report showing that the binding of a herpesvirus:__entity__ envelope:__entity__ glycoprotein:__entity__ to CR2:__entity__ on human B cells results in the activation of the NF-kappaB:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ leading to the upregulation of IL-6 gene expression in these lymphocytes .

Gene- and tissue-specificity of mutation in Big Blue rats treated with the hepatocarcinogen N-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene .
In a previous study , we found that treating transgenic Big Blue rats with the hepatocarcinogen N-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene ( N-OH-AAF ) produced the same major DNA adduct in the target liver and the nontarget spleen lymphocytes and bone marrow cells , induced lacI mutants in the liver , and induced much lower frequencies of l acI and hprt mutants in spleen lymphocytes .
In the present study , sequence analysis was conducted on lacI:__entity__ DNA:__entity__ and hprt:__entity__ cDNA:__entity__ from the mutants , to determine the mutational specificity of N-OH-AAF in the rat .
All the mutation spectra from N-OH-AAF-treated rats differed significantly from corresponding mutation profiles from untreated animals ( P = 0.02 to P < 0.0001 ) .
Although there were similarities among the mutational patterns derived from N-OH-AAF-treated rats ( e.g. , G : C -- > T : A transversion was the most common mutation in all mutation sets ) , there were significant differences in the patterns of basepair substitution and frameshift mutation between the liver and spleen lymphocyte lacI mutants ( P = 0.02 ) and between the spleen lymphocyte lacI and hprt mutants ( P = 0.04 ) .
Also , multiplex PCR analysis of genomic:__entity__ DNA:__entity__ from the hprt mutants indicated that 12 % of mutants from treated rats had major deletions in the hprt:__entity__ gene:__entity__ ; no corresponding incidence of large deletions was evident among lacI mutations .
All the mutation profiles reflect the general mutational specificity of the major DNA adduct formed by N-OH-AAF .
The differences between N-OH-AAF mutation in the endogenous:__entity__ gene:__entity__ and transgene:__entity__ can be partially explained by the structures of the two genes .
The tissue-specificity of the mutation spectra may contribute to targeting tumor formation to the liver .

Caspase:__entity__ -dependent cleavage of the hematopoietic:__entity__ specific:__entity__ adaptor:__entity__ protein:__entity__ Gads:__entity__ alters signalling from the T:__entity__ cell:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ .
Gads:__entity__ is a SH2:__entity__ and:__entity__ SH3:__entity__ domain:__entity__ -containing , hematopoietic-specific:__entity__ adaptor:__entity__ protein:__entity__ that functions in signalling from the T:__entity__ cell:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ .
Gads:__entity__ acts by linking SLP-76:__entity__ , bound by the carboxy-terminal:__entity__ Gads:__entity__ SH3:__entity__ domain:__entity__ , to tyrosine:__entity__ phosphorylated:__entity__ LAT:__entity__ which contains binding sites for the Gads:__entity__ SH2:__entity__ domain:__entity__ .
Gads:__entity__ is distinguished from Grb2:__entity__ and the closely related Grap:__entity__ protein:__entity__ by the presence of a 120:__entity__ amino:__entity__ acid:__entity__ unique:__entity__ region:__entity__ between the SH2:__entity__ domain:__entity__ and the carboxy:__entity__ terminal:__entity__ SH3:__entity__ domain:__entity__ .
Here we demonstrate that the unique region of Gads:__entity__ contains a capase:__entity__ cleavage:__entity__ site:__entity__ .
Induction of apoptosis in lymphocytes results in detectable Gads:__entity__ cleavage by 60 min .
Gads:__entity__ cleavage is blocked in vivo by treating cells with a caspase 3 inhibitor .
A putative:__entity__ caspase:__entity__ 3:__entity__ cleavage:__entity__ site:__entity__ was identified within the unique region and mutation of this site prevented Gads:__entity__ cleavage in vitro , and in vivo .
The Gads:__entity__ cleavage products retained the predicted binding specificity for SLP-76:__entity__ and LAT:__entity__ .
Expression of the Gads:__entity__ cleavage products in Jurkat T cells inhibited NFAT activation following TCR cross linking .
These findings indicate that cleavage of Gads:__entity__ in vivo could function to alter signalling downstream of the T:__entity__ cell:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ by disrupting cross talk between SLP-76:__entity__ and LAT:__entity__ .
Targeting of p300:__entity__ to the interleukin-2:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ via CREB-Rel cross-talk during mitogen:__entity__ and oncogenic molecular signaling in activated T-cells .
In this report , we explore the mechanisms of targeting of p300:__entity__ to the interleukin-2:__entity__ (:__entity__ IL-2:__entity__ ):__entity__ promoter:__entity__ in response to mitogenic and oncogenic molecular signals .
Recruitment of p300:__entity__ by cAMP-responsive:__entity__ element-binding:__entity__ protein-Rel:__entity__ cross-talk at the composite:__entity__ CD28:__entity__ response:__entity__ element:__entity__ ( CD28RE:__entity__ ) - TRE:__entity__ element:__entity__ of the IL-2:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ is essential for promoter inducibility during T-cell activation , and CD28RE-TRE:__entity__ is the exclusive target of the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I oncoprotein:__entity__ Tax:__entity__ .
The intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity of p300:__entity__ is dispensable for activation of the IL-2:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ , and the N-terminal:__entity__ 743:__entity__ residues:__entity__ contain the minimal structural requirements for synergistic transactivation of the CD28RE-TRE:__entity__ , the IL-2:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ , and endogenous IL-2:__entity__ gene:__entity__ expression .
Mutational analysis of p300:__entity__ reveals differential structural requirements for the N-terminal p300 module by individual cis-elements:__entity__ within the IL-2:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ .
These findings provide evidence that p300:__entity__ assembles at the IL-2:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ to form an enhanceosome-like signal transduction target that is centrally integrated at the CD28RE-TRE:__entity__ element:__entity__ of the IL-2:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ through specific protein module-targeted associations in activated T-cells .
Regulation of cytokine production in T-cell responses to inhalant allergen : GATA-3:__entity__ expression distinguishes between Th1- and Th2-polarized immunity .
BACKGROUND : The precise nature of allergen-specific cytokine responses in atopics versus non-atopics , in particular the 'Th1 polarity ' of responses in non-atopics , remains controversial .
This is due in part to the relative insensitivity of cytokine detection systems , and associated variations in kinetics of cytokine production and catabolism in in vitro culture systems .
As an alternative to cytokine measurement , this study focuses on expression of the transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ GATA-3:__entity__ for analysis of allergen-specific Th cell responses .
METHODS : Cord blood mononuclear cells were Th1- or Th2-polarized by culture in IL-12- or IL-4-employing established methods ; PBMC from house dust mite ( HDM ) -sensitive atopics and controls were stimulated overnight with HDM ; cytokine production was measured by ELISA and GATA-3:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ expression by PCR .
RESULTS : Cytokine:__entity__ -driven Th2 polarization of naive T cells is associated with marked upregulation of GATA-3:__entity__ expression , whereas a reciprocal expression pattern accompanies differentiation towards the Th1 cytokine phenotype .
In T cells from HDM skin prick test-positive ( HDM-SPT+/HDM-IgE+ ) volunteers , overnight stimulation results in marked upregulation of GATA-3:__entity__ expression , compared to an equally marked downregulation of expression in T cells from SPT-/IgE- subjects .
In subjects who are HDM-SPT+ but IgE- , GATA-3:__entity__ expression levels remained relatively stable during culture with HDM .
CONCLUSIONS : Upregulation of GATA-3:__entity__ expression in PBMC is a hallmark of the early phase of Th2 recall responses to specific allergen in atopics .
The reciprocal expression pattern observed in HDM-specific recall responses of non-atopics provides independent confirmation of the presence of underlying Th1-like immunity in these subjects .
The parallel findings in neonatal T cells suggest that the same approach may be utilized for monitoring the progress of allergen-specific Th1/Th2 memory development during early childhood , and hence in assessment of risk for future allergic disease .

The heat shock response reduces myelin:__entity__ oligodendrocyte:__entity__ glycoprotein:__entity__ -induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice .
The stress response ( SR ) can block inflammatory gene expression by preventing activation of transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ nuclear:__entity__ factor-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ ( NF-kappaB:__entity__ ) .
As inflammatory gene expression contributes to the pathogenesis of demyelinating diseases , we tested the effects of the SR on the progression of the demyelinating disease experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( EAE ) .
EAE was actively induced in C57BL/6 mice using an encephalitogenic myelin:__entity__ oligodendrocyte:__entity__ glycoprotein:__entity__ ( MOG:__entity__ (:__entity__ 35-55:__entity__ ):__entity__ ) peptide .
Whole body hyperthermia was used to induce a heat shock response ( HSR ) in immunized mice 2 days after the booster MOG ( 35-55 ) peptide injection .
The HSR reduced the incidence of EAE by 70 % , delayed disease onset by 6 days , and attenuated disease severity .
The HSR attenuated leukocyte infiltration into CNS assessed by quantitation of perivascular infiltrates , and by reduced staining for CD4:__entity__ and CD25:__entity__ immunopositive T-cells .
T-cell activation , assessed by the production of interferon:__entity__ gamma:__entity__ ( IFNgamma:__entity__ ) in response to MOG:__entity__ (:__entity__ 35-55:__entity__ ):__entity__ , was also decreased by the HSR .
The HSR reduced inflammatory gene expression in the brain that normally occurs during EAE , including the early increase in RANTES:__entity__ ( regulated:__entity__ on:__entity__ activation:__entity__ of:__entity__ normal:__entity__ T-cell:__entity__ expressed:__entity__ and:__entity__ secreted:__entity__ ) expression , and the later expression of the inducible form of nitric:__entity__ oxide:__entity__ synthase:__entity__ .
The early activation of transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ NF-kappaB:__entity__ was also blocked by the HSR .
The finding that the SR reduces inflammation in the brain and the clinical severity of EAE opens a novel therapeutic approach for prevention of autoimmune diseases .
In vivo detection of intracellular signaling pathways in developing thymocytes .
Information regarding the intracellular signaling processes that occur during the development of T cells has largely been obtained with the use of transgenic mouse models , which although providing invaluable information are time consuming and costly .
To this end , we have developed a novel system that facilitates the in vivo analysis of signal transduction pathways during T-lymphocyte development .
This approach uses reporter-plasmids:__entity__ for the detection of intracellular signals mediated by the mitogen-activated:__entity__ protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ or cyclic:__entity__ AMP-dependent:__entity__ protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ .
Reporter-plasmids:__entity__ are transfected into thymocytes in fetal thymic organ culture by accelerated DNA/particle bombardment ( gene gun ) , and the activation of a signaling pathway is determined in the form of a standard luciferase assay .
Importantly , this powerful technique preserves the structural integrity of the thymus , and will provide an invaluable tool to study how thymocytes respond to normal environmental stimuli encountered during differentiation within the thymic milieu .
Thus , this method allows for the monitoring of signals that occur in a biological time frame , such as during differentiation , and within the natural environment of differentiating cells .
Core-binding:__entity__ factor:__entity__ beta:__entity__ ( CBFbeta:__entity__ ) , but not CBFbeta-smooth:__entity__ muscle:__entity__ myosin:__entity__ heavy:__entity__ chain:__entity__ , rescues definitive hematopoiesis in CBFbeta:__entity__ -deficient embryonic stem cells .
Core-binding:__entity__ factor:__entity__ beta:__entity__ ( CBFbeta:__entity__ ) is the non-DNA-binding:__entity__ subunit:__entity__ of the heterodimeric:__entity__ CBFs:__entity__ .
Genes:__entity__ encoding:__entity__ CBFbeta:__entity__ ( CBFB:__entity__ ) , and one of the DNA-binding:__entity__ CBFalpha:__entity__ subunits:__entity__ ,:__entity__ Runx1:__entity__ ( also known as CBFalpha2:__entity__ , AML1:__entity__ , and PEBP2alphaB:__entity__ ) , are required for normal hematopoiesis and are also frequent targets of chromosomal translocations in acute leukemias in humans .
Homozygous disruption of either the Runx1:__entity__ or:__entity__ Cbfb:__entity__ gene:__entity__ in mice results in embryonic lethality at midgestation due to hemorrhaging in the central nervous system , and severely impairs fetal liver hematopoiesis .
Results of this study show that Cbfb-deficient mouse embryonic stem ( ES ) cells can differentiate into primitive erythroid colonies in vitro , but are impaired in their ability to produce definitive erythroid and myeloid colonies , mimicking the in vivo defect .
Definitive hematopoiesis is restored by ectopic expression of full-length:__entity__ Cbfb:__entity__ transgenes:__entity__ , as well as by a transgene encoding only the heterodimerization:__entity__ domain:__entity__ of CBFbeta:__entity__ .
In contrast , the CBFbeta:__entity__ - smooth:__entity__ muscle:__entity__ myosin:__entity__ heavy:__entity__ chain:__entity__ (:__entity__ SMMHC:__entity__ ):__entity__ fusion:__entity__ protein:__entity__ generated by the inv:__entity__ (:__entity__ 16:__entity__ ):__entity__ associated with acute myeloid leukemias ( M4Eo ) can not rescue definitive hematopoiesis by Cbfb-deficient ES cells .
Sequences responsible for the inability of CBFbeta:__entity__ -SMMHC to rescue definitive hematopoiesis reside in the SMMHC:__entity__ portion:__entity__ of the fusion:__entity__ protein:__entity__ .
Results also show that the CBFbeta-SMMHC:__entity__ fusion:__entity__ protein:__entity__ transdominantly inhibits definitive hematopoiesis , but not to the same extent as homozygous loss of Runx1:__entity__ or Cbfb:__entity__ .
CBFbeta-SMMHC:__entity__ preferentially inhibits the differentiation of myeloid lineage cells , while increasing the number of blastlike cells in culture .
The latency pattern of Epstein-Barr virus infection and viral IL-10:__entity__ expression in cutaneous natural killer/T-cell lymphomas .
The nasal type , extranodal natural killer or T ( NK/T ) -cell lymphoma is usually associated with latent Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) infection .
In order to elucidate the EBV gene expression patterns in vivo , we examined eight patients with cutaneous EBV-related NK/T-cell lymphomas , including six patients with a NK-cell phenotype and two patients with a T-cell phenotype .
The implication of EBV in the skin lesions was determined by the presence of EBV-DNA:__entity__ , EBV-encoded:__entity__ nuclear:__entity__ RNA:__entity__ ( EBER:__entity__ ) and a clonality of EBV-DNA:__entity__ fragments:__entity__ containing the terminal:__entity__ repeats:__entity__ .
Transcripts of EBV-encoded:__entity__ genes:__entity__ were screened by reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) , and confirmed by Southern blot hybridization .
The expression of EBV-related:__entity__ antigens:__entity__ was examined by immunostaining using paraffin-embedded tissue sections and cell pellets of EBV-positive cell lines .
Our study demonstrated that all samples from the patients contained EBV:__entity__ nuclear:__entity__ antigen:__entity__ (:__entity__ EBNA:__entity__ ):__entity__ -1:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ which was transcribed using the Q:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ , whereas both the Q:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ and another upstream:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ ( Cp/Wp:__entity__ ) were used in EBV-positive cell lines , B95.8 , Raji and Jiyoye .
Latent:__entity__ membrane:__entity__ protein-1:__entity__ (:__entity__ LMP-1:__entity__ ):__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ was detected in seven of eight patients and all cell lines , whereas EBNA-2:__entity__ transcripts:__entity__ were found only in the cell lines .
Immunostaining showed no LMP-1:__entity__ ,:__entity__ EBNA-2:__entity__ or:__entity__ ZEBRA:__entity__ antigens:__entity__ in the paraffin-embedded tissue sections , although they were positive in the cell line cells .
Latent:__entity__ BHRF1:__entity__ transcripts:__entity__ encoding bcl-2:__entity__ homologue:__entity__ and BCRF1:__entity__ transcripts:__entity__ encoding viral:__entity__ interleukin:__entity__ (:__entity__ vIL:__entity__ ):__entity__ -10:__entity__ were detected in one and two of eight patients , respectively .
A patient with NK-cell lymphoma expressing both transcripts died of rapid progression of the illness .
Our results indicate that the restricted expression of the latency-associated:__entity__ EBV:__entity__ genes:__entity__ and the production of vIL-10:__entity__ and:__entity__ bcl-2:__entity__ homologue:__entity__ may favour tumour growth , evading the host immune surveillance .

Oxidized alkyl phospholipids are specific , high affinity peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ligands and agonists .
Synthetic high affinity peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( PPAR ) agonists are known , but biologic ligands are of low affinity .
Oxidized:__entity__ low:__entity__ density:__entity__ lipoprotein:__entity__ ( oxLDL:__entity__ ) is inflammatory and signals through PPARs:__entity__ .
We showed , by phospholipase A ( 1 ) digestion , that PPARgamma agonists in oxLDL:__entity__ arise from the small pool of alkyl phosphatidylcholines in LDL:__entity__ .
We identified an abundant oxidatively fragmented alkyl phospholipid in oxLDL:__entity__ , hexadecyl azelaoyl phosphatidylcholine ( azPC ) , as a high affinity ligand and agonist for PPARgamma:__entity__ .
[ ( 3 ) H ] azPC bound recombinant:__entity__ PPARgamma:__entity__ with an affinity ( K ( d ) ( ( app ) ) approximately 40 nm ) that was equivalent to rosiglitazone ( BRL49653 ) , and competition with rosiglitazone showed that binding occurred in the ligand-binding:__entity__ pocket:__entity__ .
azPC induced PPRE reporter gene expression , as did rosiglitazone , with a half-maximal effect at 100 nm .
Overexpression of PPARalpha:__entity__ or PPARgamma:__entity__ revealed that azPC was a specific PPARgamma agonist .
The scavenger:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ CD36:__entity__ is encoded by a PPRE-responsive:__entity__ gene:__entity__ , and azPC enhanced expression of CD36:__entity__ in primary human monocytes .
We found that anti-CD36:__entity__ inhibited azPC uptake , and it inhibited PPRE reporter induction .
Results with a small molecule phospholipid:__entity__ flippase:__entity__ mimetic:__entity__ suggest azPC acts intracellularly and that cellular azPC accumulation was efficient .
Thus , certain alkyl phospholipid oxidation products in oxLDL:__entity__ are specific , high affinity extracellular ligands and agonists for PPARgamma:__entity__ that induce PPAR-responsive:__entity__ genes:__entity__
Regulation of the human:__entity__ MAT2B:__entity__ gene:__entity__ encoding the regulatory:__entity__ beta:__entity__ subunit:__entity__ of methionine:__entity__ adenosyltransferase:__entity__ , MAT:__entity__ II:__entity__ .
Methionine:__entity__ adenosyltransferase:__entity__ ( MAT:__entity__ ) catalyzes the biosynthesis of S-adenosylmethionine:__entity__ ( AdoMet:__entity__ ) , a key molecule in transmethylation reactions and polyamine biosynthesis .
The MAT:__entity__ II:__entity__ isozyme:__entity__ consists of a catalytic:__entity__ alpha2:__entity__ and:__entity__ a:__entity__ regulatory:__entity__ beta:__entity__ subunit:__entity__ .
Down-regulation of the MAT:__entity__ II:__entity__ beta:__entity__ subunit:__entity__ expression causes a 6-10-fold increase in intracellular AdoMet:__entity__ levels .
To understand the mechanism by which the beta:__entity__ subunit:__entity__ expression is regulated , we cloned the MAT2B:__entity__ gene:__entity__ , determined its organization , characterized its 5'-flanking:__entity__ sequences:__entity__ , and elucidated the in vitro and in vivo regulation of its promoter:__entity__ .
Transcription of the MAT2B:__entity__ gene:__entity__ initiates at position -203 relative to the translation:__entity__ start:__entity__ site:__entity__ .
Promoter:__entity__ deletion:__entity__ analysis:__entity__ defined a minimal:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ between positions:__entity__ +52:__entity__ and:__entity__ +93:__entity__ base pairs , a GC-rich:__entity__ region:__entity__ .
Inclusion of the sequences between -4 and +52 enhanced promoter activity ; this was primarily because of an Sp1:__entity__ recognition:__entity__ site:__entity__ at +9/+15 .
The inclusion of sequences up to position -115 provided full activity ; this was attributed to a TATA:__entity__ at -32 .
The Sp1:__entity__ site:__entity__ at position +9 was key for the formation of protein.DNA complexes .
Mutation of both the Sp1:__entity__ site:__entity__ at +9 and the TATA:__entity__ at -32 reduced promoter activity to its minimal level .
Supershift assays showed no effect of the anti-Sp1:__entity__ antibody:__entity__ on complex formation , whereas the anti-Sp3:__entity__ antibody:__entity__ had a strong effect on protein.DNA complex formation , suggesting that Sp3:__entity__ is one of the main factors binding to this Sp1:__entity__ site:__entity__ .
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays supported the involvement of both Sp1:__entity__ and Sp3:__entity__ in complexes formed on the MAT2B:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ .
The data show that the 5'-untranslated:__entity__ sequences:__entity__ play an important role in regulating the MAT2B:__entity__ gene:__entity__ and identifies the Sp1:__entity__ site:__entity__ at +9 as a potential target for modulating MAT2B expression , a process that can have a major effect on intracellular AdoMet:__entity__ levels .
Molecular pathogenesis of influenza A virus infection and virus-induced regulation of cytokine:__entity__ gene:__entity__ expression .
Despite vaccines and antiviral substances influenza still causes significant morbidity and mortality world wide .
Better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of influenza virus replication , pathogenesis and host immune responses is required for the development of more efficient means of prevention and treatment of influenza .
Influenza A virus , which replicates in epithelial cells and leukocytes , regulates host cell transcriptional and translational systems and activates , as well as downregulates apoptotic pathways .
Influenza A virus infection results in the production of chemotactic ( RANTES:__entity__ , MIP-1:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ , MCP-1:__entity__ , MCP-3:__entity__ , and IP-10:__entity__ ) , pro-inflammatory ( IL-1:__entity__ beta:__entity__ , IL-6:__entity__ , IL-18:__entity__ , and TNF-alpha:__entity__ ) , and antiviral:__entity__ (:__entity__ IFN-alpha/beta:__entity__ ):__entity__ cytokines:__entity__ .
Cytokine gene expression is associated with the activation of NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ , AP-1:__entity__ , STAT:__entity__ and IRF:__entity__ signal:__entity__ transducing:__entity__ molecules:__entity__ in influenza A virus-infected cells .
In addition of upregulating cytokine:__entity__ gene:__entity__ expression , influenza A virus infection activates caspase-1:__entity__ enzyme:__entity__ , which is involved in the proteolytic processing of proIL-1:__entity__ beta:__entity__ and proIL-18:__entity__ into their biologically active forms .
Influenza A virus-induced IFN-alpha/beta:__entity__ is essential in host 's antiviral defence by activating the expression of antiviral:__entity__ Mx:__entity__ , PKR:__entity__ and:__entity__ oligoadenylate:__entity__ synthetase:__entity__ genes:__entity__ .
IFN-alpha/beta:__entity__ also prolongs T cell survival , upregulates IL-12 and IL-18 receptor gene expression and together with IL-18:__entity__ stimulates NK and T cell IFN-gamma production and the development of Th1-type immune response .
Comparison of hprt and lacI mutant frequency with DNA adduct formation in N-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene-treated Big Blue rats .
N-Hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene ( N-OH-AAF ) is the proximate carcinogenic metabolite of the powerful rat liver carcinogen 2-acetylaminofluorene .
In this study , transgenic Big Blue ( R ) rats were used to examine the relationship between in vivo mutagenicity and DNA adduct formation by N-OH-AAF in the target liver compared with that in nontarget tissues .
Male rats were given one , two , or four doses of 25 mg N-OH-AAF/kg body weight by i.p. injection at 4-day intervals , and groups of treated and control rats were euthanized up to 10 weeks after beginning the dosing .
Mutant frequencies were measured in the spleen:__entity__ lymphocyte:__entity__ hprt:__entity__ gene:__entity__ , and lacI mutant frequencies were determined in the liver and spleen lymphocytes .
At 6 weeks after beginning the dosing , the hprt mutant frequency in spleen lymphocytes from the four-dose group was 16.5 x 10 ( -6 ) compared with 3.2 x 10 ( -6 ) in control animals .
Also at 6 weeks , rats given one , two , or four doses of N-OH-AAF had lacI mutant frequencies in the liver of 97.6 , 155.6 , and 406.8 x 10 ( -6 ) , respectively , compared with a control frequency of 25.7 x 10 ( -6 ) ; rats given four doses had lacI mutant frequencies in spleen lymphocytes of 55.8 x 10 ( -6 ) compared with a control frequency of 20.4 x 10 ( -6 ) .
Additional rats were evaluated for DNA adduct formation in the liver , spleen lymphocytes , and bone marrow by ( 32 ) P-postlabeling .
Adduct analysis was conducted 1 day after one , two , and four treatments with N-OH-AAF , 5 days after one treatment , and 9 days after two treatments .
N- ( Deoxyguanosin-8-yl ) -2-aminofluorene was the major DNA adduct identified in all the tissues examined .
Adduct concentrations increased with total dose to maximum values in samples taken 1 day after two doses , and remained essentially the same after four doses .
In samples taken after four doses , adduct levels were 103 , 28 , and 7 fmol/microg of DNA in liver , spleen lymphocytes , and bone marrow , respectively .
The results indicate that the extent of both DNA adduct formation and mutant induction correlates with the organ specificity for N-OH-AAF carcinogenesis in the rat .

Expression of Mad1:__entity__ in T cells leads to reduced thymic cellularity and impaired mitogen-induced proliferation .
To investigate Mad1:__entity__ function in vivo , transgenic mice were generated that express a Mad1:__entity__ transgene:__entity__ in T lineage cells under the control of the proximal:__entity__ lck:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ .
Thymus size in lck-Mad1 transgenic mice is drastically reduced although representation of the various thymocyte sub populations appears normal .
To investigate more closely any effects of Mad1 expression on thymocytes , we examined thymic selection using MHC class I-restricted H-Y-TCR transgenic mice .
Mad1 expression in vivo reduces the efficiency of positive selection .
Furthermore , thymocytes and splenic T cells from lck-Mad1 transgenic mice display a profound proliferative defect in response to activation with either PMA/Ionomycin or immobilized:__entity__ anti-CD3/CD28:__entity__ antibody:__entity__ .
This proliferative defect is not reversed by addition of exogenous:__entity__ IL-2:__entity__ and is p53-independent .
The growth inhibition caused by Mad1:__entity__ is overcome by expression of active:__entity__ c-Myc:__entity__ .
Differential requirement for the transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ PU.1:__entity__ in the generation of natural killer cells versus B and T cells .
PU.1:__entity__ is a member of the Ets:__entity__ family:__entity__ of:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ required for the development of various lymphoid and myeloid cell lineages , but its role in natural killer ( NK ) cell development is not known .
The study shows that PU.1:__entity__ is expressed in NK cells and that , on cell transfer into alymphoid Rag2/gammac ( -/- ) mice , hematopoietic progenitors of PU.1 ( -/- ) fetal liver cells could generate functional NK cells but not B or T cells .
Nevertheless , the numbers of bone marrow NK cell precursors and splenic mature NK cells were reduced compared to controls .
Moreover , PU.1 ( -/- ) NK cells displayed reduced expression of the receptors for stem:__entity__ cell:__entity__ factor:__entity__ and interleukin:__entity__ (:__entity__ IL:__entity__ ):__entity__ -7:__entity__ , suggesting a nonredundant role for PU.1:__entity__ in regulating the expression of these cytokine:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ genes:__entity__ during NK cell development .
PU.1 ( -/- ) NK cells also showed defective expression of inhibitory and activating members of the Ly49:__entity__ family:__entity__ and failed to proliferate in response to IL-2:__entity__ and IL-12:__entity__ .
Thus , despite the less stringent requirement for PU.1:__entity__ in NK cell development compared to B and T cells , PU.1:__entity__ regulates NK cell differentiation and homeostasis .
Benzene-extracted components are important for the major activity of diesel exhaust particles : effect on interleukin-8:__entity__ gene:__entity__ expression in human bronchial epithelial cells .
Epidemiologic and experimental studies suggest that diesel exhaust particles ( DEPs ) may be related to increasing respiratory mortality and morbidity .
We have shown that DEPs augmented the production of inflammatory:__entity__ cytokines:__entity__ by human airway epithelial cells in vitro .
To better understand the mechanisms of their proinflammatory activities , we studied the effects of several components extracted from DEPs on interleukin ( IL ) -8 expression in human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B and normal human airway epithelial cells obtained from very peripheral airways by an ultrathin bronchoscope .
We used several agents active on signal transduction pathways in cytokine expression , such as the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporin , antioxidant agents including N-acetyl cysteine ( NAC ) and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) , and p38:__entity__ mitogen-activated:__entity__ protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ ( MAPK:__entity__ ) inhibitor SB203580 .
Benzene-extracted components showed effects mimicking DEPs on IL-8 gene expression , release of several cytokines:__entity__ ( IL-8:__entity__ ; granulocyte:__entity__ macrophage:__entity__ colony-stimulating:__entity__ factor:__entity__ ; and regulated on activation , normal T cells expressed and secreted ) and nuclear factor ( NF ) -kappa B activation .
We also found that NAC , PDTC , and SB203580 suppressed the activities of DEPs and their benzene extracts , suggesting the roles of oxidants-mediated NF-kappa B activation and p38MAPK:__entity__ pathways .
Finally , benzo [ a ] pyrene , one of the important compounds included in the benzene component , replicated the activities shown by DEPs .
The nuclear:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ PPAR:__entity__ gamma:__entity__ is expressed by mouse T lymphocytes and PPAR gamma agonists induce apoptosis .
Peroxisome:__entity__ proliferator-activated:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ (:__entity__ PPAR:__entity__ ):__entity__ -gamma:__entity__ is a nuclear:__entity__ hormone:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ that serves as a trans factor to regulate lipid metabolism .
Intense interest is focused on PPAR-gamma:__entity__ and its ligands owing to its putative role in adipocyte differentiation .
Little is known , however , about the functions of PPAR-gamma:__entity__ in the immune system , especially in T lymphocytes .
We demonstrate that both naive and activated ovalbumin-specific T cells from DO11.10-transgenic mice express PPAR-gamma:__entity__ mRNA and protein .
In order to determine the function of PPAR-gamma:__entity__ , T cells were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin or antigen and antigen-presenting cells .
Simultaneous exposure to PPAR-gamma ligands ( e.g. 15-deoxy-Delta ( 12 , 14 ) -prostaglandin J ( 2 ) , troglitazone ) showed drastic inhibition of proliferation and significant decreases in cell viability .
The decrease in cell viability was due to apoptosis of the T lymphocytes , and occurred only when cells were treated with PPAR-gamma:__entity__ , and not PPAR-alpha agonists , revealing specificity of this response for PPAR-gamma:__entity__ .
These observations suggest that PPAR-gamma agonists play an important role in regulating T cell-mediated immune responses by inducing apoptosis .
T cell death via PPAR-gamma ligation may act as a potent anti-inflammatory signal in the immune system , and ligands could possibly be used to control disorders in which excessive inflammation occurs .
Suppression of lung inflammation in rats by prevention of NF-kappaB activation in the liver .
Activation of NF-kappaB:__entity__ and production of NF-kappaB:__entity__ -dependent chemokines:__entity__ are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of neutrophilic lung inflammation .
Calpain-1 inhibitor ( CI-1 ) blocks activation of NF-kappaB:__entity__ by preventing proteolysis of the inhibitory protein IkappaB-alpha:__entity__ by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway .
We hypothesized that inhibition of proteasome function with CI-1 would block NF-kappaB activation in vivo after intraperitoneal ( i.p. ) treatment with bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , and that NF-kappaB inhibition would be associated with suppression of chemokine gene expression and attenuation of neutrophilic alveolitis .
We treated rats with a single i.p. injection of CI-1 ( 10 mg/kg ) two hours prior to i.p. LPS ( 7 mg/kg ) .
Treatment with Cl-1 prevented degradation of IkappaB-alpha:__entity__ and activation of NF-kappaB:__entity__ in the liver in response to LPS ; however , Cl-1 treatment had no detected effect on NF-kappaB activation in lung tissue .
CI-1 treatment prior to LPS resulted in 40 % lower MIP-2 concentration in lung lavage fluid compared to rats treated with vehicle prior to LPS ( 502 +/- 112 pg/ml vs. 859 +/-144 pg/ml , P < 0.05 ) .
In addition , CI-1 treatment substantially inhibited LPS-induced neutrophilic alveolitis ( 2.7+ /- 1.2 x 10 ( 5 ) vs. 43.7 +/- 12.2 x 10 ( 5 ) lung lavage neutrophils , P < 0.01 ) .
These data indicate that NF-kappaB inhibition in the liver can alter lung inflammation induced by systemic LPS treatment and suggest that a liver-lung interaction contributes to the inflammatory response of the lung .
Notch1:__entity__ regulates maturation of CD4+ and CD8+ thymocytes by modulating TCR signal strength .
Notch signaling regulates cell fate decisions in multiple lineages .
We demonstrate in this report that retroviral expression of activated Notch1:__entity__ in mouse thymocytes abrogates differentiation of immature CD4+CD8+ thymocytes into both CD4 and CD8 mature single-positive T cells .
The ability of Notch1:__entity__ to inhibit T cell development was observed in vitro and in vivo with both normal and TCR transgenic thymocytes .
Notch1:__entity__ -mediated developmental arrest was dose dependent and was associated with impaired thymocyte responses to TCR stimulation .
Notch1:__entity__ also inhibited TCR-mediated signaling in Jurkat T cells .
These data indicate that constitutively active Notch1:__entity__ abrogates CD4+ and CD8+ maturation by interfering with TCR signal strength and provide an explanation for the physiological regulation of Notch expression during thymocyte development .
Expression of SART3:__entity__ antigen:__entity__ and induction of CTLs by SART3-derived peptides in breast cancer patients .
We recently reported the SART3:__entity__ tumour-rejection:__entity__ antigen:__entity__ as possessing tumour epitopes capable of inducing HLA-class I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTLs ) .
This study investigated expression of the SART3:__entity__ antigen:__entity__ in breast cancer to explore an appropriate molecule for use in specific immunotherapy of breast cancer patients .
The SART3:__entity__ antigen:__entity__ was detected in all of the breast cancer cell lines tested , 30 of 40 ( 75 % ) breast cancer tissue samples , and 0 of 3 non-tumourous breast tissue samples .
SART3 derived peptides at positions:__entity__ 109-118:__entity__ and:__entity__ 315-323:__entity__ induced HLA-A24 restricted CTLs that reacted to breast cancer cells from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) of breast cancer patients .
Therefore , the SART3:__entity__ antigen:__entity__ and its peptides could be an appropriate molecule for use in specific immunotherapy of the majority of HLA-A24-positive breast cancer patients
Autostimulation of the Epstein-Barr virus BRLF1:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ is mediated through consensus Sp1:__entity__ and:__entity__ Sp3:__entity__ binding:__entity__ sites:__entity__ .
As an essential step in the lytic cascade , the Rta homologues of gammaherpesviruses all activate their own expression .
Consistent with this biologic function , the Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) Rta:__entity__ protein:__entity__ powerfully stimulates the promoter:__entity__ of its own gene , Rp:__entity__ , in EBV-positive B cells in transient-transfection reporter-based assays .
We analyzed the activity of RpCAT:__entity__ in response to Rta:__entity__ by deletional and site-directed mutagenesis .
Two cognate:__entity__ Sp1:__entity__ binding:__entity__ sites:__entity__ located at -279 and -45 relative to the transcriptional:__entity__ start:__entity__ site:__entity__ proved crucial for Rta-mediated activation .
Previously described binding sites for the cellular transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ Zif268:__entity__ and the viral:__entity__ transactivator:__entity__ ZEBRA:__entity__ were found to be dispensable for activation of RpCAT:__entity__ by Rta:__entity__ .
Gel shift analysis , using extracts of B cells in latency or induced into the lytic cycle , identified Sp1:__entity__ and Sp3:__entity__ as the predominant cellular:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ bound to Rp:__entity__ near -45 .
During the lytic cycle , ZEBRA:__entity__ bound Rp:__entity__ near the Sp1/Sp3:__entity__ site:__entity__ .
The binding of Sp1:__entity__ and Sp3:__entity__ to Rp:__entity__ correlated with the reporter activities in the mutagenesis study , establishing a direct link between transcriptional activation of Rp:__entity__ by Rta:__entity__ and DNA binding by Sp1:__entity__ and/or Sp3:__entity__ .
The relative abundance or functional state of the cellular Sp1:__entity__ and Sp3:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ may be altered in response to stimuli that induce the BRLF1:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ and thereby contribute to the activation of the viral lytic cycle .
Gene transfer of antisense hypoxia:__entity__ inducible:__entity__ factor-1:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ enhances the therapeutic efficacy of cancer immunotherapy .
Solid tumors meet their demands for nascent blood vessels and increased glycolysis , to combat hypoxia , by activating multiple genes involved in angiogenesis and glucose metabolism .
Hypoxia:__entity__ inducible:__entity__ factor-1:__entity__ ( HIF-1:__entity__ ) is a constitutively expressed basic helix-loop-helix:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ , formed by the assembly of HIF-1alpha:__entity__ and HIF-1beta:__entity__ ( Arnt:__entity__ ) , that is stablized in response to hypoxia , and rapidly degraded under normoxic conditions .
It activates the transcription of genes important for maintaining oxygen homeostasis .
Here , we demonstrate that engineered down-regulation of HIF-1alpha:__entity__ by intratumoral gene transfer of an antisense:__entity__ HIF-1alpha:__entity__ plasmid:__entity__ leads to the down-regulation of VEGF:__entity__ , and decreased tumor microvessel density .
Antisense HIF-1alpha monotherapy resulted in the complete and permanent rejection of small ( 0.1 cm in diameter ) EL-4 tumors , which is unusual for an anti-angiogenic agent where transient suppression of tumor growth is the norm .
It induced NK cell -dependent rejection of tumors , but failed to stimulate systemic T cell -mediated anti-tumor immunity , and synergized with B7-1-mediated immunotherapy to cause the NK cell and CD8 T cell -dependent rejection of larger EL-4 tumors ( 0.4 cm in diameter ) that were refractory to monotherapies .
Mice cured of their tumors by combination therapy resisted a rechallenge with parental tumor cells , indicating systemic antitumor immunity had been achieved .
In summary , whilst intensive investigations are in progress to target the many HIF-1:__entity__ effectors , the results herein indicate that blocking hypoxia-inducible pathways and enhancing NK-mediated antitumor immunity by targeting HIF-1:__entity__ itself may be advantageous , especially when combined with cancer immunotherapy .
Runx2:__entity__ : a novel oncogenic effector revealed by in vivo complementation and retroviral tagging .
The Runx2:__entity__ ( Cbfa1:__entity__ , Pebp2alphaA:__entity__ , Aml3:__entity__ ) gene was previously identified as a frequent target for transcriptional activation by proviral insertion in T-cell lymphomas of CD2-MYC transgenic mice .
We have recently shown that over-expression of the full-length , most highly expressed Runx2:__entity__ isoform in the thymus perturbs T-cell development , leads to development of spontaneous lymphomas at low frequency and is strongly synergistic with Myc:__entity__ .
To gain further insight into the relationship of Runx2:__entity__ to other lymphomagenic pathways , we tested the effect of combining the CD2-Runx2:__entity__ transgene:__entity__ either with a Pim1:__entity__ transgene:__entity__ ( E:__entity__ (:__entity__ mu:__entity__ ):__entity__ -Pim1:__entity__ ) or with the p53:__entity__ null genotype , as each of these displays independent synergy with Myc:__entity__ .
In both cases we observed synergistic tumour development .
However , Runx2:__entity__ appeared to have a dominant effect on the tumour phenotype in each case , with most tumours conforming to the CD3 ( + ) , CD8 ( + ) , CD4 ( +/- ) phenotype seen in CD2-Runx2 mice .
Neonatal infection of CD2-Runx2 mice with Moloney murine leukaemia virus ( Moloney MLV ) also led to a dramatic acceleration of tumour onset .
Analysis of known Moloney:__entity__ MLV:__entity__ target:__entity__ genes:__entity__ in these lymphomas showed a high frequency of rearrangement at c-Myc:__entity__ or N-Myc:__entity__ ( 82 % ) , and a significant number at Pim1:__entity__ or Pim2:__entity__ ( 23 % ) , and at Pal1/Gfi1:__entity__ ( 18 % ) .
These results indicate that Runx2:__entity__ makes a distinct contribution to T-cell lymphoma development which does not coincide with any of the oncogene complementation groups previously identified by retroviral tagging .
The involvement of TNF-alpha:__entity__ -related apoptosis-inducing ligand in the enhanced cytotoxicity of IFN-beta:__entity__ -stimulated human dendritic cells to tumor cells .
TNF-alpha:__entity__ -related apoptosis-inducing ligand ( TRAIL ) is characterized by its preferential induction of apoptosis of tumor cells but not normal cells .
Dendritic cells ( DCs ) , besides their role as APCs , now have been demonstrated to exert cytotoxicity or cytostasis on some tumor cells .
Here , we report that both human CD34 ( + ) stem cell -derived DCs ( CD34DCs ) and human CD14 ( + ) monocyte -derived DCs ( MoDCs ) express TRAIL and exhibit cytotoxicity to some types of tumor cells partially through TRAIL .
Moderate expression of TRAIL appeared on CD34DCs from the 8th day of culture and was also seen on freshly isolated monocytes .
The level of TRAIL expression remained constant until DC maturation .
TRAIL expression on immature CD34DCs or MoDCs was greatly up-regulated after IFN-beta:__entity__ stimulation .
Moreover , IFN-beta:__entity__ could strikingly enhance the ability of CD34DCs or MoDCs to kill TRAIL-sensitive tumor cells , but LPS did not have such an effect .
The up-regulation of TRAIL on IFN-beta:__entity__ -stimulated DCs partially contributed to the increased cytotoxicity of DCS : Pretreatment of TRAIL-sensitive tumor cells with caspase-3 inhibitor could significantly increase their resistance to the cytotoxicity of IFN-beta:__entity__ -stimulated DCS : In contrast , NF-kappaB inhibitor could significantly increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to the killing by nonstimulated or LPS-stimulated DCS : Our studies demonstrate that IFN-beta:__entity__ -stimulated DCs are functionally cytotoxic .
Thus , an innate mechanism of DC-mediated antitumor immunity might exist in vivo in which DCs act as effectors to directly kill tumor cells partially via TRAIL .
Subsequently , DCs act as APCs involved in the uptake , processing , and presentation of apoptotic:__entity__ tumor:__entity__ Ags:__entity__ to cross-prime CD8 ( + ) CTL cells .
Tumor cells regulate the lytic activity of tumor-specific cytotoxic t lymphocytes by modulating the inhibitory natural killer receptor function .
Tumor-infiltrating p58+ T cells from a renal tumor were specifically expanded in response to tumor cell stimulation and cloned .
These p58+ T cells were found to express a memory phenotype and corresponded to clonal TCRBV3 T-cell expansion .
Functionally , p58 ( + ) CTLs displayed a low lytic activity for HLA-A2 tumor and normal cells .
However , this lytic activity was significantly increased after blockade of p58:__entity__ with specific monoclonal:__entity__ antibodies:__entity__ .
Interestingly , we demonstrated that stimulation by tumor cells was required to trigger the inhibitory effect of p58:__entity__ on the lytic activity of antigen-specific CTLs and that stimulation of the inhibitory function of p58:__entity__ by tumor cells correlated with an inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB activation in p58+ tumor-specific CTLS .
T-cell:__entity__ factor-1:__entity__ expression during human natural killer cell development and in circulating CD56:__entity__ (:__entity__ +:__entity__ ):__entity__ bright natural killer cells .
Transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ are essential to govern differentiation along the lymphoid lineage from uncommitted hematopoietic stem cells .
Although many of these transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ have putative roles based on murine knockout experiments , their function in human lymphoid development is less known and was studied further .
Transcription factor expression in fresh and cultured adult human bone marrow and umbilical cord blood progenitors was evaluated .
We found that fresh CD34 ( + ) Lin ( - ) cells that are human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) -DR ( - ) or CD38 ( - ) constitutively express GATA-3:__entity__ but not T-cell:__entity__ factor-1:__entity__ ( TCF-1:__entity__ ) or Id-3:__entity__ .
Culture with the murine fetal liver cell line AFT024 and defined cytokines:__entity__ was capable of inducing TCF-1:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ .
However , no T-cell:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ gene:__entity__ rearrangement was identified in cultured progeny .
Id-3:__entity__ , a basic:__entity__ helix:__entity__ loop:__entity__ helix:__entity__ factor:__entity__ with dominant negative function for T-cell differentiation transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ , also was upregulated and may explain unsuccessful T-cell maturation .
To better understand the developmental link between natural killer ( NK ) cells derived from progenitors , we studied NK cell subsets circulating in blood .
CD56 ( +bright ) , but not CD56 ( +dim ) , NK cells constitutively express TCF-1:__entity__ by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis .
The TCF-1:__entity__ isoform:__entity__ found in CD56 ( +bright ) cells , which express lectin:__entity__ but not immunoglobulin:__entity__ class:__entity__ I:__entity__ recognizing inhibitory:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ , was identical to that induced in NK cell differentiation culture and was distinctly different from isoforms in T cells .
These results suggest that TCF-1:__entity__ does not target human:__entity__ killer:__entity__ immunoglobulin:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ genes:__entity__ , TCF-1:__entity__ is uniquely expressed in circulating CD56 ( +bright ) NK cells , and specific TCF-1:__entity__ isoforms:__entity__ may play an important role in regulating NK differentiation from a common NK/T-cell progenitor .
Transcriptional activation by a matrix:__entity__ associating:__entity__ region-binding:__entity__ protein:__entity__ .
contextual requirements for the function of bright:__entity__ .
Bright:__entity__ ( B:__entity__ cell:__entity__ regulator:__entity__ of:__entity__ IgH:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ ) is a B cell -specific , matrix:__entity__ associating:__entity__ region-binding:__entity__ protein:__entity__ that transactivates gene expression from the IgH:__entity__ intronic:__entity__ enhancer:__entity__ ( E:__entity__ mu:__entity__ ) .
We show here that Bright:__entity__ has multiple contextual requirements to function as a transcriptional:__entity__ activator:__entity__ .
Bright:__entity__ can not transactivate via out of context , concatenated:__entity__ binding:__entity__ sites:__entity__ .
Transactivation is maximal on integrated substrates .
Two of the three previously identified binding:__entity__ sites:__entity__ in E:__entity__ mu:__entity__ are required for full Bright:__entity__ transactivation .
The Bright:__entity__ DNA:__entity__ binding:__entity__ domain:__entity__ defined a new family , which includes SWI1:__entity__ , a component of the SWI.SNF:__entity__ complex:__entity__ shown to have high mobility group-like DNA binding characteristics .
Similar to one group of high:__entity__ mobility:__entity__ group:__entity__ box:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ , Bright:__entity__ distorts E:__entity__ mu:__entity__ binding:__entity__ site:__entity__ -containing DNA on binding , supporting the concept that it mediates E:__entity__ mu:__entity__ remodeling .
Transfection studies further implicate Bright:__entity__ in facilitating spatially separated promoter-enhancer interactions in both transient and stable assays .
Finally , we show that overexpression of Bright:__entity__ leads to enhanced DNase I sensitivity of the endogenous E:__entity__ mu:__entity__ matrix associating regions .
These data further suggest that Bright:__entity__ may contribute to increased gene expression by remodeling the immunoglobulin:__entity__ locus:__entity__ during B cell development .
Analysis of BCL-6 mutations in classic Hodgkin disease of the B- and T-cell type .
BCL-6:__entity__ is essential for germinal center formation and thus for affinity maturation of immunoglobulin:__entity__ (:__entity__ Ig:__entity__ ):__entity__ genes:__entity__ by somatic mutations .
The 5'-noncoding:__entity__ region:__entity__ of the BCL-6:__entity__ gene:__entity__ is even a target for the mutation machinery .
Translocations of the BCL-6:__entity__ gene:__entity__ to heterologous:__entity__ promoters:__entity__ and mutations of its 5'-noncoding:__entity__ regulatory:__entity__ region:__entity__ were reported to be potential mechanisms for deregulating BCL-6:__entity__ expression and for playing a role in the genesis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma .
In line with this hypothesis is the observation that B-cell lymphoma with somatic mutations , such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma , also carry BCL-6 mutations , some of which are recurrently detectable .
Classic Hodgkin disease ( cHD ) is also derived from B cells with high loads of somatic mutations and thus a further candidate for BCL-6 mutations .
To determine the presence and potential role of BCL-6 mutations in cHD , the 5'-noncoding:__entity__ BCL-6:__entity__ proportion of single Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg ( HRS ) cells from 6 cases of cHD and 6 cases of HD-derived cell lines was analyzed .
All B-cell-derived HD cases and cell lines harbored BCL-6 mutations .
In contrast , both T-cell-derived HD cases and cell lines were devoid of BCL-6 mutations .
With only one exception , there were no lymphoma-specific recurrent BCL-6 mutations detected , and BCL-6:__entity__ protein:__entity__ was absent from the HRS cells of most cases .
In conclusion , ( 1 ) somatic BCL-6 mutations are restricted to cHD cases of B-cell origin , and ( 2 ) the BCL-6 mutations represent mostly irrelevant somatic base substitutions without consequences for BCL-6:__entity__ protein:__entity__ expression and the pathogenesis of cHD .
Gadd45gamma:__entity__ is dispensable for normal mouse development and T-cell proliferation .
Gadd45gamma:__entity__ , a family member of the growth:__entity__ arrest:__entity__ and:__entity__ DNA:__entity__ damage-inducible:__entity__ gene:__entity__ family:__entity__ 45:__entity__ ( Gadd45:__entity__ ) , is strongly induced by interleukin-2:__entity__ ( IL-2:__entity__ ) in peripheral T cells .
While in most tissues all Gadd45:__entity__ family:__entity__ members:__entity__ are expressed , Gadd45gamma:__entity__ is the only member that is induced by IL-2:__entity__ .
Here we show that the IL-2:__entity__ -induced expression of Gadd45gamma:__entity__ is dependent on a signaling pathway mediated by the tyrosine:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ Jak3:__entity__ and the transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ Stat5a:__entity__ and Stat5b:__entity__ ( signal:__entity__ transducer:__entity__ and:__entity__ activator:__entity__ of:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ ) .
Previous studies with ectopically overexpressed Gadd45gamma:__entity__ in various cell lines implicated its function in negative growth control .
To analyze the physiological role of Gadd45gamma:__entity__ we used homologous recombination to generate mice lacking Gadd45gamma:__entity__ .
Gadd45gamma:__entity__ -deficient mice develop normally , are indistinguishable from their littermates , and are fertile .
Furthermore , hematopoiesis in mice lacking Gadd45gamma:__entity__ is not impaired and Gadd45gamma:__entity__ -deficient T lymphocytes show normal responses to IL-2:__entity__ .
These data demonstrate that Gadd45gamma:__entity__ is not essential for normal mouse development and hematopoiesis , possibly due to functional redundancy among the Gadd45:__entity__ family:__entity__ members:__entity__ .
Gadd45gamma:__entity__ is also dispensable for IL-2:__entity__ -induced T-cell proliferation .
Decreased expression of c-myc:__entity__ family:__entity__ genes:__entity__ in thymuses from myasthenia gravis patients .
The thymus is a critical organ for the elimination of autoreactive T cells by apoptosis .
We studied the expression of apoptosis-associated genes , bcl-xL:__entity__ , bad:__entity__ , caspase-3:__entity__ , and c-myc:__entity__ family:__entity__ genes:__entity__ in myasthenia gravis ( MG ) thymuses .
We observed that the mRNA levels of myc:__entity__ family:__entity__ genes:__entity__ , c-myc:__entity__ and max:__entity__ , were markedly reduced in MG thymuses .
These results indicate that c-myc:__entity__ -mediated signaling is abnormal in MG thymuses .
The levels of molecules whose expressions are associated with myc:__entity__ , such as STAM:__entity__ , prothymosin-alpha:__entity__ , and NFkappaB:__entity__
Immunohistochemical detection of interferon-gamma-producing cells in dermatophytosis .
Skin lesions of dermatophytosis are thought to be a result of a T cell -dependent inflammatory response that is mediated by various cytokines:__entity__ .
We examined whether IFN-gamma-positive cells ( as expression of Th1 response ) were present in the skin lesions of dermatophytosis in situ by immunohistochemical techniques .
Mixtures of CD4-positive T cells and CD8-positive T cells were found to be present in the dermal infiltrates of the lesions .
Considerable numbers of CD1a-positive cells were detected in the upper dermis and epidermis .
A marked accumulation of CD68-positive cells was found in the upper dermis .
IFN-gamma-positive cells were present in the upper dermis of the lesions .
The pattern of IFN-gamma:__entity__ staining appeared to be intracellular in mononuclear lymphoid cells .
The staining was considered to be highly specific because it could be completely blocked by preabsorption with recombinant:__entity__ IFN-gamma:__entity__ .
Our data support the hypothesis that the skin lesions of dermatophytosis may be associated with a Th1 response .
Th1 response , which is characterized by IFN-gamma:__entity__ release , is thought to be involved in the host defense against dermatophytes and to reflect cutaneous reaction in dermatophytosis .
Regulation of the helix-loop-helix:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ , E2A:__entity__ and Id3:__entity__ , by the Ras:__entity__ - ERK:__entity__ MAPK:__entity__ cascade .
Activation of mitogen-activated:__entity__ protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ ( MAPK:__entity__ ) pathways leads to cellular differentiation and/or proliferation in a wide variety of cell types , including developing thymocytes .
The basic:__entity__ helix-loop-helix:__entity__ (:__entity__ bHLH:__entity__ ):__entity__ proteins:__entity__ E12:__entity__ and E47:__entity__ and an inhibitor:__entity__ HLH:__entity__ protein:__entity__ , Id3:__entity__ , play key roles in thymocyte differentiation .
We show here that E2A:__entity__ DNA binding is lowered in primary immature thymocytes consequent to T cell receptor ( TCR ) -mediated ligation .
Whereas expression of E2A mRNA and protein are unaltered , Id3:__entity__ transcripts:__entity__ are rapidly induced upon signaling from the TCR:__entity__ .
Activation of Id3 transcription is regulated in a dose-dependent manner by the extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK:__entity__ ) MAPK:__entity__ module .
These observations directly connect the ERK:__entity__ MAPK:__entity__ cascade and HLH:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ in a linear pathway .
Retinoic acid up-regulates myeloid ICAM-3 expression and function in a cell-specific fashion -- evidence for retinoid signaling pathways in the mast cell lineage .
Investigation of mast cell responsiveness toward retinoic acid ( RA ) revealed selective promotion of ICAM-3:__entity__ expression in the human mast cell line HMC-1 .
This process was dose- and time-dependent and detectable by flow cytometry , Western blot analysis , ELISA , and Northern blot analysis .
ICAM-3:__entity__ modulation was found to be cell-type dependent , detectable also for HL-60 cells and monocytes but not U-937 and only weakly for KU812 cells .
Terminally differentiated skin mast cells also failed to up-modulate their ICAM-3:__entity__ , suggesting the requirement for some degree of immaturity for the process .
RA-mediated effects on ICAM-1:__entity__ expression , studied in parallel , were clearly distinct from those on ICAM-3:__entity__ .
Investigation of retinoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ expression , known to mediate intracellular RA signaling , revealed presence of RAR:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ ,:__entity__ RAR:__entity__ gamma:__entity__ ,:__entity__ RXR:__entity__ beta:__entity__ ,:__entity__ and:__entity__ RXR:__entity__ gamma:__entity__ transcripts:__entity__ in all cell lines studied , and HMC-1 cells were the only line lacking RXR:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ .
RAR:__entity__ beta:__entity__ , not expressed at baseline , was induced by RA in a fashion obviously correlating with ICAM-3:__entity__ up-regulation .
Increased ICAM-3:__entity__ expression was of functional significance , such that processes stimulated or co-stimulated via ICAM-3:__entity__ ( homotypic aggregation , IL-8 secretion ) were clearly enhanced upon RA pretreatment , suggesting that RA may contribute via hitherto unrecognized pathways to immune function and host defense .
CD28:__entity__ and T cell co-stimulation .
Over the last decade the concept of T cell co-stimulation has emerged to take a central role in the process of T cell activation .
However , the exact definition of co-stimulation is still unclear .
In this review , we re-examine the concept of co-stimulation .
We suggest that while co-stimulation is important , there is little evidence to link co-stimulation with T cell anergy .
We then suggest a framework for studying co-stimulation .
Focusing on recent advances in our understanding of CD28:__entity__ , we discuss four areas of T cell activation where co-stimulation may play a role .
Regulation of activator:__entity__ protein-1:__entity__ and NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ in CD8+ T cells exposed to peripheral:__entity__ self-antigens:__entity__ .
The transcriptional events that control T cell tolerance to peripheral:__entity__ self:__entity__ Ags:__entity__ are still unknown .
In this study , we analyzed the regulation of AP-1:__entity__ - and NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ -mediated transcription during in vivo induction of tolerance to a self:__entity__ Ag:__entity__ expressed exclusively on hepatocytes .
Naive CD8 ( + ) Desire ( Des ) ( + ) T cells isolated from the Des TCR-transgenic mice that are specific for the H-2K:__entity__ (:__entity__ b:__entity__ ):__entity__ class:__entity__ I:__entity__ Ag:__entity__ were transferred into Alb-K ( b ) -transgenic mice that express the H-2K:__entity__ (:__entity__ b:__entity__ ):__entity__ Ag:__entity__ on hepatocytes only .
Tolerance develops in these mice .
We found that the self-reactive CD8 ( + ) Des ( + ) T cells were transiently activated , then became unresponsive and were further deleted .
In contrast to CD8 ( + ) Des ( + ) T cells activated in vivo with APCs , which express high AP-1:__entity__ and high NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ transcriptional activity , the unresponsive CD8 ( + ) Des ( + ) T cells expressed no AP-1:__entity__ and only weak NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ transcriptional activity .
The differences in NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ transcriptional activity correlated with the generation of distinct NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ complexes:__entity__ .
Indeed , in vivo primed T cells predominantly express p50/p50:__entity__ and:__entity__ p65/p50:__entity__ dimers:__entity__ , whereas these p50-containing:__entity__ complexes:__entity__ are barely detectable in tolerant T cells that express p65-:__entity__ and:__entity__ c-Rel-containing:__entity__ complexes:__entity__ .
These observations suggest that fine regulation of NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ complex:__entity__ formation may determine T cell fate .
Transcriptional regulation in lymphocytes .
Lymphocytes have been used to investigate many cellular processes , including lineage commitment , differentiation , proliferation and apoptosis .
The transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ that mediate these processes are often expressed broadly in many cell types .
The emerging theme is one of cell-type-specific regulation , affecting not only the functional activation of transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ but also their access to appropriate regions of DNA .
Existence of retinoic:__entity__ acid-receptor:__entity__ -independent retinoid:__entity__ X-receptor:__entity__ -dependent pathway in myeloid cell function .
We previously reported that ER-27191 ( 4- [ 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10-hexahydro-7 , 7 , 10 , 10-tetramethyl-1- ( 3-pyridylmethyl ) anthra [ 1 , 2-b ] pyrrol-3-yl ] benzoic acid ) is a potent antagonist of retinoic:__entity__ acid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ ( RAR:__entity__ ) , and ER-35795 ( ( 2E , 4E , 6E ) -7- [ 1- ( 1-methylethyl ) -8-chloro-1 , 2 , 3 , 4-tetrahydroquinolin-6-yl ] -6-fluoro-3-methyl-2 , 4 , 6-nonatrienoic acid ) is a novel retinoid:__entity__ X:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ ( RXR:__entity__ ) -specific agonist .
By using these compounds , we investigated whether distinct RAR:__entity__ -dependent and RXR:__entity__ -dependent pathways operate to mediate the diverse activities of retinoids , particularly , the effects of the RXR:__entity__ pathway on cellular function .
ER-27191 completely antagonized HL60 cell differentiation induced by all-trans-retinoic acid ( atRA ) .
However , the differentiation induced by the ER-35795 was not antagonized at all by the RAR:__entity__ antagonist , but was inhibited by an RXR:__entity__ homodimer:__entity__ antagonist ( LGD100754 , ( 2E , 4E , 6Z ) -7- ( 3-n-propoxy-5 , 6 , 7 , 8-tetrahydro-5 , 5 , 8 , 8-tetramethylnaphthalen-2-yl ) -3-methylocta-2 , 4 , 6-trienoic acid ) .
Its agonistic action on RXR/RAR:__entity__ heterodimer:__entity__ , on the other hand , was neutralized by the RAR:__entity__ antagonist .
During HL60 cell differentiation , atRA induced RARbeta:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ , while the RXR:__entity__ had no effect .
Interestingly , a functional RXR:__entity__ -pathway was also seen in lipopolysaccharide-induced inhibition of mouse splenocyte proliferation .
These results strongly suggest the existence of a pharmacological RXR:__entity__ -dependent pathway that is activated by a ligand that can bind to RXR:__entity__ .
Targeting Src:__entity__ homology:__entity__ 2:__entity__ domain-containing:__entity__ tyrosine:__entity__ phosphatase:__entity__ ( SHP-1:__entity__ ) into lipid rafts inhibits CD3:__entity__ -induced T cell activation .
To study the mechanism by which protein:__entity__ tyrosine:__entity__ phosphatases:__entity__ ( PTPs:__entity__ ) regulate CD3:__entity__ -induced tyrosine phosphorylation , we investigated the distribution of PTPs:__entity__ in subdomains of plasma membrane .
We report here that the bulk PTP:__entity__ activity associated with T cell membrane is present outside the lipid rafts , as determined by sucrose density gradient sedimentation .
In Jurkat T cells , approximately 5 -- 10 % of Src:__entity__ homology:__entity__ 2:__entity__ domain-containing:__entity__ tyrosine:__entity__ phosphatase:__entity__ ( SHP-1:__entity__ ) is constitutively associated with plasma membrane , and nearly 50 % of SHP-2:__entity__ is translocated to plasma membrane after vanadate treatment .
Similar to transmembrane:__entity__ PTP:__entity__ , CD45:__entity__ , the membrane-associated populations of SHP-1:__entity__ and SHP-2:__entity__ are essentially excluded from lipid rafts , where other signaling:__entity__ molecules:__entity__ such as Lck:__entity__ ,:__entity__ linker:__entity__ for:__entity__ activation:__entity__ of:__entity__ T:__entity__ cells:__entity__ , and CD3:__entity__ zeta:__entity__ are enriched .
We further demonstrated that CD3:__entity__ -induced tyrosine phosphorylation of these substrates is largely restricted to lipid rafts , unless PTPs:__entity__ are inhibited .
It suggests that a restricted partition of PTPs:__entity__ among membrane subdomains may regulate protein tyrosine phosphorylation in T cell membrane .
To test this hypothesis , we targeted SHP-1:__entity__ into lipid rafts by using the N-terminal:__entity__ region:__entity__ of:__entity__ Lck:__entity__ ( residues:__entity__ 1:__entity__ --:__entity__ 14:__entity__ ) .
The results indicate that the expression of Lck/SHP-1:__entity__ chimera:__entity__ inside lipid rafts profoundly inhibits CD3:__entity__ -induced tyrosine phosphorylation of CD3:__entity__ zeta/epsilon:__entity__ , IL-2 generation , and nuclear mobilization of NF-AT:__entity__ .
Collectively , these results suggest that the exclusion of PTPs:__entity__ from lipid rafts may be a mechanism that potentiates TCR:__entity__ / CD3:__entity__ activation
An instructive component in T helper cell type 2 ( Th2 ) development mediated by GATA-3:__entity__ .
Although interleukin:__entity__ (:__entity__ IL:__entity__ ):__entity__ -12:__entity__ and IL-4:__entity__ polarize naive CD4 ( + ) T cells toward T helper cell type 1 ( Th1 ) or Th2 phenotypes , it is not known whether cytokines:__entity__ instruct the developmental fate in uncommitted progenitors or select for outgrowth of cells that have stochastically committed to a particular fate .
To distinguish these instructive and selective models , we used surface affinity matrix technology to isolate committed progenitors based on cytokine secretion phenotype and developed retroviral-based tagging approaches to directly monitor individual progenitor fate decisions at the clonal and population levels .
We observe IL-4:__entity__ -dependent redirection of phenotype in cells that have already committed to a non-IL-4-producing fate , inconsistent with predictions of the selective model .
Further , retroviral tagging of naive progenitors with the Th2-specific:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ GATA-3:__entity__ provided direct evidence for instructive differentiation , and no evidence for the selective outgrowth of cells committed to either the Th1 or Th2 fate .
These data would seem to exclude selection as an exclusive mechanism in Th1 / Th2 differentiation , and support an instructive model of cytokine-driven transcriptional programming of cell fate decisions .
In vitro-activated human lupus T cells express normal estrogen:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ which bind to the estrogen:__entity__ response:__entity__ element:__entity__ .
We have shown that estrogen:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ ( ERalpha:__entity__ , ERbeta:__entity__ ) transcripts are expressed in SLE and normal T cells .
In this study , T cell nuclear extracts from female lupus patients and normal donors were tested for biologically active ER:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ capable of binding to the human:__entity__ estrogen:__entity__ response:__entity__ element:__entity__ ( hERE:__entity__ ) by electrophoretic mobility shift assays .
When peripheral blood T cells were stimulated with 17beta-estradiol ( E2 ) , PMA and ionomycin , two major retarded bands in T cell nuclear extracts exhibited a migration pattern similar to slow migrating protein-ERE:__entity__ complexes:__entity__ in human breast cancer cell extracts .
T cells cultured only with E2 did not have these complexes .
The formation of the complexes was inhibited by competition with the hERE cold oligonucleotide and partially with anti-ERalpha:__entity__ antibodies:__entity__ .
There was no notable difference in the migration pattern of ERE-binding:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ between the SLE and normal T cell extracts .
Together , these results suggest that activated human T cells , whether lupus-derived or normal-derived , contain biologically active ERalpha:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ .
Other factors may be responsible for differential sensitivity of lupus T cells to estrogen .
Mechanism of the inhibitory effect of protease inhibitor on tumor:__entity__ necrosis:__entity__ factor:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ production of monocytes .
If the inflammatory response becomes excessive or uncontrolled by some stimuli , inappropriate inflammatory responses occur .
Monocytes are extremely important cells for regulating the cytokine network and tumor:__entity__ necrosis:__entity__ factor:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ ( TNFalpha:__entity__ ) and interleukin-:__entity__ (:__entity__ IL:__entity__ ):__entity__ 10:__entity__ , which are mainly synthesized by monocytes , are representative cytokines:__entity__ that play a central role in the cytokine network .
Protease inhibitors such as gabexate mesilate ( GM ) and ulinastatin ( UTI ) have been shown to have various beneficial effects by inhibiting the activation of leukocytes , but the mechanism for this has yet to be fully elucidated .
In this study we investigated the mechanism of the inhibitory effect of protease inhibitors on the proinflammatory cytokine production of lipopolysaccharide- ( LPS ) stimulated monocytes .
LPS-stimulated monocytes were treated with GM or UTI .
The value of TNFalpha:__entity__ and IL-10:__entity__ in the culture medium of monocytes was measured and each mRNA expression was assayed .
The inhibitory effect of protease inhibitors on the activity of intracellular signal transduction pathways such as protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ C:__entity__ ( PKC:__entity__ ) and nuclear:__entity__ factor:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ ( NFkappaB:__entity__ ) were also evaluated .
GM decreased the TNFalpha:__entity__ production of LPS-stimulated monocytes as shown by the inhibition of mRNA expression and increased the IL-10:__entity__ production of LPS-stimulated monocytes .
GM also suppressed the NFkappaB:__entity__ activity of LPS-stimulated monocytes .
UTI decreased the TNFalpha:__entity__ production of LPS-stimulated monocytes , but did not inhibit the TNFalpha:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ expression .
The present study shows that the inhibitory effect of GM on the TNFalpha:__entity__ production of activated human monocytes is mediated by the suppression of NFkappaB:__entity__ activation , while the mechanism of UTI inhibiting TNFalpha:__entity__ production of human monocytes may be due to the inhibition of either the translation or secretion of TNFalpha:__entity__ .
Homocysteine stimulates the expression of monocyte:__entity__ chemoattractant:__entity__ protein-1:__entity__ in endothelial cells leading to enhanced monocyte chemotaxis .
Hyperhomocysteinemia has been identified as an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis .
The infiltration of monocytes into the arterial wall is one of the key events during atherogenesis .
Monocyte:__entity__ chemoattractant:__entity__ protein-1:__entity__ ( MCP-1:__entity__ ) is a potent chemokine:__entity__ that stimulates the migration of monocytes into the intima of the arterial wall .
The mechanism by which increased monocyte infiltration occurs in atherosclerotic lesions in patients with hyperhomocysteinemia has not been delineated .
The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of homocysteine on MCP-1:__entity__ production in endothelial cells .
Cells were incubated with homocysteine .
The secretion of MCP-1:__entity__ protein:__entity__ was significantly increased ( 195 % as compared to the control ) in cells treated with pathological concentrations of homocysteine .
Such effect was accompanied by an increased expression of MCP-1:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ ( 176 % as compared to the control ) in endothelial cells which resulted in enhanced monocyte chemotaxis .
The p38:__entity__ MAP:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ as well as other members of the p38 MAP kinase pathway , including MKK3:__entity__ , MKK6:__entity__ , ATF-2:__entity__ and Elk-1:__entity__ , were activated in homocysteine-treated cells .
Homocysteine-induced MCP-1:__entity__ expression and subsequent monocyte chemotaxis were blocked by a p38:__entity__ MAP:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ inhibitor ( SB203580 ) suggesting that the p38:__entity__ MAP:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ pathway might be involved in homocysteine-induced MCP-1:__entity__ expression in endothelial cells .
In contrast , staurosporine , a protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ C:__entity__ inhibitor , had no effect on homocysteine-induced MCP-1:__entity__ expression .
In conclusion , our results indicate that homocysteine stimulates MCP-1:__entity__ expression in endothelial cells leading to enhanced monocyte chemotaxis .
Inducible resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis in B cells .
Apoptosis produced in B cells through Fas:__entity__ ( APO-1:__entity__ , CD95:__entity__ ) triggering is regulated by signals derived from other surface receptors : CD40 engagement produces upregulation of Fas:__entity__ expression and marked susceptibility to Fas:__entity__ -induced cell death , whereas antigen receptor engagement , or IL-4R engagement , inhibits Fas:__entity__ killing and in so doing induces a state of Fas:__entity__ -resistance , even in otherwise sensitive , CD40:__entity__ -stimulated targets .
Surface:__entity__ immunoglobulin:__entity__ and IL-4R:__entity__ utilize at least partially distinct pathways to produce Fas:__entity__ -resistance that differentially depend on PKC:__entity__ and STAT6:__entity__ , respectively .
Further , surface immunoglobulin signaling for inducible Fas:__entity__ -resistance bypasses Btk:__entity__ , requires NF-kappaB:__entity__ , and entails new macromolecular synthesis .
Terminal effectors of B cell Fas:__entity__ -resistance include the known anti-apoptotic:__entity__ gene:__entity__ products:__entity__ , Bcl-xL:__entity__ and FLIP:__entity__ , and a novel anti-apoptotic:__entity__ gene:__entity__ that encodes FAIM:__entity__ ( Fas:__entity__ Apoptosis:__entity__ Inhibitory:__entity__ Molecule:__entity__ ) .
faim:__entity__ was identified by differential display and exists in two alternatively spliced forms ; faim-S:__entity__ is broadly expressed , but faim-L expression is tissue-specific .
The FAIM:__entity__ sequence:__entity__ is highly evolu- tionarily conserved , suggesting an important role for this molecule throughout phylogeny .
Inducible resistance to Fas:__entity__ killing is hypothesized to protect foreign antigen-specific B cells during potentially hazardous interactions with FasL-bearing T cells , whereas autoreactive B cells fail to become Fas:__entity__ -resistant and are deleted via Fas:__entity__ -dependent cytotoxicity .
Inadvertent or aberrant acquisition of Fas:__entity__ -resistance may permit autoreactive B cells to escape Fas:__entity__ deletion , and malignant lymphocytes to impede anti-tumor immunity .
Stromal:__entity__ cell-derived:__entity__ factor:__entity__ 1:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ -induced chemotaxis in T cells is mediated by nitric oxide signaling pathways .
Stromal:__entity__ cell-derived:__entity__ factor:__entity__ 1:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ ( SDF1:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ ) and its cognate chemokine:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ CXCR4:__entity__ act as potent chemoattractants and regulate trafficking and homing of hematopoietic progenitor cells and lymphocytes .
However , the molecular mechanisms regulating SDF1:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ -driven cell migration are not well defined .
In this study , we have explored the roles of the second messenger NO and the transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ in SDF1:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ -induced T cell migration .
SDF1:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ treatment of Jurkat T cells increased the activity of NO:__entity__ synthase:__entity__ , which catalyzes the generation of NO .
We observed that pretreatment of Jurkat cells or activated PBLs with several NO donors significantly enhanced the SDF1:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ -induced migration , whereas various inhibitors of NO:__entity__ synthase:__entity__ markedly abrogated the chemotactic response in a concentration-dependent manner .
Furthermore , we observed that inhibitors of the transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ , which is linked to NO signaling pathways , also significantly blocked the SDF1:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ -induced chemotactic response .
However , these compounds did not have a significant effect on SDF1:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ -induced mitogen-activated protein kinase activity .
In addition , the MAP/Erk kinase kinase inhibitor PD98059 did not abrogate SDF1:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ -induced chemotaxis .
AKT:__entity__ , which has been shown to mediate NO production , was also phosphorylated upon SDF1:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ stimulation .
These studies suggest that NO-related signaling pathways may mediate SDF1:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ -induced chemotaxis , but not mitogen-activated:__entity__ protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ activation .
The lack of NF-kappa B transactivation and PKC epsilon expression in CD4 ( + ) CD8 ( + ) thymocytes correlates with negative selection .
Deletion of autoreactive thymocytes at the DP stage is the basis for tolerance to thymus-expressed:__entity__ self:__entity__ antigens:__entity__ .
In this study we investigated whether distinct signalling pathways are induced in DP thymocytes as compared to mature T cells upon stimulation with antigen .
Using triple transgenic mice expressing a TCR:__entity__ transgene:__entity__ , dominant:__entity__ negative:__entity__ ras/Mek:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ and a reporter:__entity__ gene:__entity__ construct:__entity__ with AP-1:__entity__ or:__entity__ NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ binding:__entity__ sites:__entity__ , we showed a complete lack of transcriptional activity of NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ but not AP-1:__entity__ in DP thymocytes , whereas both were transcriptionally active in mature T cells after antigenic stimulation .
Lack of NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ induction correlated with increased death in response to antigen:__entity__ .
AP-1:__entity__ induction was dependent on the integrity of the ras/Mek pathway indicating that this pathway was activated in the DP thymocytes .
In contrast , we found a complete lack of constitutive expression of the epsilon:__entity__ isoform:__entity__ of:__entity__ Protein:__entity__ Kinase:__entity__ C:__entity__ ( PKC:__entity__ ) in DP thymocytes , although it was present in mature thymocytes and peripheral T cells .
Taken together the results suggest that the lack of PKC:__entity__ epsilon:__entity__ in DP thymocytes could lead to the absence of NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ activity after antigenic stimulation contributing to negative selection .

CD2 stimulation leads to the delayed and prolonged activation of STAT1:__entity__ in T cells but not NK cells .
OBJECTIVE : T lymphocytes can be activated by soluble factors such as cytokines:__entity__ or through direct cell-cell interactions .
Although cytokine:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ are known to signal through STAT:__entity__ family:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ , the mechanisms by which other cell-surface:__entity__ molecules:__entity__ , such as CD2:__entity__ , transduce signals is unclear .
The goal of this study was to determine whether stimulation of T cells through CD2:__entity__ recapitulates aspects of cytokine:__entity__ -induced T-cell activation by use of STAT:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ .
MATERIALS AND METHODS : T cells were treated with anti-CD2:__entity__ antibodies:__entity__ or cells bearing the natural CD2:__entity__ ligand:__entity__ CD58:__entity__ , after which signaling through STAT:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ was assessed .
RESULTS : Stimulation of CD2:__entity__ on primary T lymphocytes leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation , nuclear translocation , and DNA binding of STAT1:__entity__ .
In contrast to stimulation by cytokines:__entity__ , the activation of STAT1:__entity__ in response to CD2 ligation is delayed and does not involve Jak:__entity__ kinases:__entity__ .
Furthermore , while STAT phosphorylation induced by cytokines:__entity__ is generally transient , STAT1 phosphorylation following CD2 stimulation persists for a period of days .
Transcription of key target genes such as IRF1:__entity__ and c-fos:__entity__ proceeds with delayed kinetics following CD2 stimulation , suggesting that this unique pattern of STAT activation may lead to a distinct cellular response following CD2 ligation .
This pathway appears to be restricted to T cells , as stimulation of CD2:__entity__ on NK cells does not lead to STAT1 activation .
CONCLUSION : Stimulation of T cells through cell-surface:__entity__ molecules:__entity__ such as CD2:__entity__ involves activation of STAT:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ , thus recapitulating elements of cytokine signaling .
NFATc1:__entity__ and NFATc2:__entity__ together control both T and B cell activation and differentiation .
NFAT:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ play critical roles in gene transcription during immune responses .
To investigate further the two most prominent NFAT:__entity__ family:__entity__ members:__entity__ , NFATc1:__entity__ and NFATc2:__entity__ , we generated mice bearing lymphoid systems devoid of both .
Doubly deficient T cells displayed cell surface markers of activation yet were significantly deficient in the development of multiple effector functions , including Th:__entity__ cytokine:__entity__ production , surface:__entity__ effector:__entity__ molecule:__entity__ expression , and cytolytic activity .
Nevertheless , doubly deficient B cells were hyperactivated , as evidenced by extremely elevated serum IgG1:__entity__ and IgE:__entity__ , as well as plasma cell expansion and infiltration of end organs .
Thus , in T cells , NFATc1:__entity__ and NFATc2:__entity__ are dispensable for inflammatory reactivity but are required for effector differentiation , while in B cells , NFATs:__entity__ regulate both normal homeostasis and differentiation .
Epstein-barr virus immediate-early:__entity__ protein:__entity__ BZLF1:__entity__ is SUMO-1 modified and disrupts promyelocytic leukemia bodies .
Although the immediate-early:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ of both herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) and cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) are known to modify promyelocytic leukemia ( PML ) ( ND10 ) bodies in the nucleus of the host cell , it has been unclear whether lytic infection with gamma herpesviruses induces a similar effect .
The PML:__entity__ protein:__entity__ is induced by interferon:__entity__ , involved in major:__entity__ histocompatibility:__entity__ complex:__entity__ class:__entity__ I:__entity__ presentation , and necessary for certain types of apoptosis .
Therefore , it is likely that PML bodies function in an antiviral capacity .
SUMO-1 modification of PML:__entity__ is known to be required for the formation of PML bodies .
To examine whether Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) lytic replication interferes with PML bodies , we expressed the EBV:__entity__ immediate-early:__entity__ genes:__entity__ BZLF1:__entity__ (:__entity__ Z:__entity__ ):__entity__ and BRLF1:__entity__ (:__entity__ R:__entity__ ):__entity__ in EBV-positive cell lines and examined PML:__entity__ localization .
Both Z and R expression resulted in PML:__entity__ dispersion in EBV-positive cells .
Z but not R expression is sufficient to disrupt PML bodies in EBV-negative cell lines .
We show that dispersion of PML bodies by Z:__entity__ requires a portion of the transcriptional:__entity__ activation:__entity__ domain:__entity__ of Z:__entity__ but not the DNA-binding function .
As was previously reported for the HSV-1:__entity__ ICP0:__entity__ and:__entity__ CMV:__entity__ IE1:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ , Z:__entity__ reduces the amount of SUMO-1-modified:__entity__ PML:__entity__ .
We also found that Z:__entity__ itself is SUMO-1 modified ( through amino acid 12 ) and that Z:__entity__ competes with PML:__entity__ for limiting amounts of SUMO-1:__entity__ .
These results suggest that disruption of PML bodies is important for efficient lytic replication of EBV .
Furthermore , Z:__entity__ may potentially alter the function of a variety of cellular proteins by inhibiting SUMO-1 modification
Suppression of nuclear:__entity__ factor-kappaB:__entity__ and stimulation of inhibitor:__entity__ kappaB:__entity__ by troglitazone : evidence for an anti-inflammatory effect and a potential antiatherosclerotic effect in the obese .
To elucidate whether troglitazone exerts an antiinflammatory effect in humans , in vivo , we investigated the suppression of nuclear:__entity__ factor:__entity__ kappaB:__entity__ ( NFkappaB:__entity__ ) in mononuclear cells ( MNC ) by this drug .
We measured intranuclear:__entity__ NFkappaB:__entity__ , total cellular:__entity__ NFkappaB:__entity__ , inhibitor:__entity__ kappaB:__entity__ (:__entity__ IkappaB:__entity__ ):__entity__ alpha:__entity__ , reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) generation , and p47:__entity__ (:__entity__ phox:__entity__ ):__entity__ subunit:__entity__ ( a key component protein of nicotinamide:__entity__ adenine:__entity__ dinucleotide:__entity__ phosphate:__entity__ oxidase:__entity__ ) in MNC .
Plasma:__entity__ tumor:__entity__ necrosis:__entity__ factor:__entity__ (:__entity__ TNF:__entity__ ):__entity__ -alpha:__entity__ , soluble:__entity__ intercellular:__entity__ adhesion:__entity__ molecule-1:__entity__ ( sICAM-1:__entity__ ) , monocyte:__entity__ chemoattractant:__entity__ protein-1:__entity__ (:__entity__ MCP-1:__entity__ ):__entity__ , plasminogen:__entity__ activator:__entity__ inhibitor:__entity__ type:__entity__ 1:__entity__ ( PAI-1:__entity__ ) , C-reactive:__entity__ protein:__entity__ (:__entity__ CRP:__entity__ ):__entity__ , and interleukin:__entity__ (:__entity__ IL:__entity__ ):__entity__ -10:__entity__ ( antiinflammatory:__entity__ cytokine:__entity__ ) concentrations were also measured as mediators of inflammatory activity that are regulated by the proinflammatory:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ NFkappaB:__entity__ .
Seven nondiabetic obese patients were given 400 mg troglitazone daily for 4 weeks .
Blood samples were collected before and at weekly intervals thereafter .
MNC were separated ; and the levels of intranuclear:__entity__ NFkappaB:__entity__ , total cellular:__entity__ NFkappaB:__entity__ , IkappaBalpha:__entity__ , and p47:__entity__ (:__entity__ phox:__entity__ ):__entity__ subunit:__entity__ and ROS generation were determined .
Plasma was used to measure insulin glucose , TNFalpha:__entity__ , sICAM:__entity__ , MCP-1:__entity__ , PAI-1:__entity__ , CRP:__entity__ , and IL-10:__entity__ .
Plasma insulin concentrations fell significantly at week 1 , from 31.2 +/- 29.1 to 14.2 +/- 11.4 mU/L ( P < 0.01 ) and remained low throughout 4 weeks .
Plasma glucose concentrations did not alter significantly .
There was a fall in intranuclear:__entity__ NFkappaB:__entity__ , total cellular:__entity__ NFkappaB:__entity__ , and p47:__entity__ (:__entity__ phox:__entity__ ):__entity__ subunit:__entity__ , with an increase in cellular IkappaBalpha:__entity__ at week 2 , which persisted until week 4 .
There was a parallel fall in ROS generation by MNC at week 1 ; this progressed and persisted until week 4 ( P < 0.001 ) .
Plasma TNF-alpha:__entity__ , sICAM-1:__entity__ , MCP-1:__entity__ , and PAI-1:__entity__ concentrations fell significantly at week 4 .
Plasma IL-10:__entity__ concentration increased significantly , whereas plasma:__entity__ CRP:__entity__ concentrations decreased .
We conclude that troglitazone has an antiinflammatory action that may contribute to its putative antiatherosclerotic effects .
Tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent activation of NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ .
Requirement for p56:__entity__ LCK:__entity__ and:__entity__ ZAP-70:__entity__ protein:__entity__ tyrosine:__entity__ kinases:__entity__ .
Phosphorylation of the N-terminal:__entity__ domain:__entity__ of I:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ inhibitory:__entity__ subunits:__entity__ induces activation of the transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ .
Although serine phosphorylation has been shown to induce ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation of I:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B-alpha:__entity__ , little is known about the mechanisms that lead to release of active NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ in T cells as a consequence of tyrosine phosphorylation of I:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B-alpha:__entity__ [ Imbert , V. , Rupec , R.A. , Livolsi , A. , Pahl , H.L. , Traenckner , B.M. , Mueller-Dieckmann , C. , Farahifar , D. , Rossi , B. , Auberger , P. , Baeuerle , P. & Peyron , J.F. ( 1996 ) Cell 86 , 787 -- 798 ] .
The involvement of the tyrosine:__entity__ kinases:__entity__ p56:__entity__ (:__entity__ lck:__entity__ ):__entity__ and ZAP-70:__entity__ in this reaction is demonstrated here using specific pharmacological inhibitors and Jurkat mutants unable to express these kinases:__entity__ .
Although the inhibitors prevented both pervanadate-induced phosphorylation of I:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B-alpha:__entity__ on Tyr42 and NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ activation , we observed that , in p56 ( lck ) -deficient Jurkat mutants , NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ could still associate with I:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B-alpha:__entity__ despite phosphorylation on Tyr42 .
Furthermore , the SH2:__entity__ domain:__entity__ of p56:__entity__ (:__entity__ lck:__entity__ ):__entity__ appeared to be required for pervanadate-induced NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ activation but not for Tyr42 phosphorylation .
These results show that p56:__entity__ (:__entity__ lck:__entity__ ):__entity__ and ZAP-70:__entity__ are key components of the signaling pathway that leads to phosphotyrosine-dependent NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ activation in T cells and confirm that tyrosine:__entity__ kinases:__entity__ must control at least two different steps to induce activation of NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ .
Finally , we show that H ( 2 ) O ( 2 ) , which stimulates p56:__entity__ (:__entity__ lck:__entity__ ):__entity__ and ZAP-70:__entity__ in T cells , is an activator of NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ through tyrosine phosphorylation of I:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B-alpha:__entity__ .
Specific missense mutations in NEMO:__entity__ result in hyper-IgM syndrome with hypohydrotic ectodermal dysplasia .
The gene that encodes nuclear:__entity__ factor:__entity__ kappaB:__entity__ (:__entity__ NF-kappaB:__entity__ ):__entity__ essential:__entity__ modulator:__entity__ ( or NEMO:__entity__ , also known as IKKgamma:__entity__ ) is required for activation of the transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ NF-kappaB:__entity__ .
We describe mutations in the putative:__entity__ zinc-finger:__entity__ domain:__entity__ of NEMO:__entity__ that result in an X-linked primary immunodeficiency characterized by hyper-IgM syndrome and hypohydrotic ectodermal dysplasia ( XHM-ED ) .
These mutations prevent CD40:__entity__ ligand:__entity__ ( CD40L:__entity__ ) -mediated degradation of inhibitor of NF-kappaB:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ ( IkappaB-alpha:__entity__ ) and account for the following observations : B cells from XHM-ED patients are unable to undergo immunoglobulin class-switch recombination and antigen-presenting cells ( APCs ) are unable to synthesize the NF-kappaB-regulated:__entity__ cytokines:__entity__ interleukin:__entity__ 12:__entity__ ( IL-12:__entity__ ) or tumor:__entity__ necrosis:__entity__ factor:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ ( TNF-alpha:__entity__ ) when stimulated with CD40L:__entity__ .
Nevertheless , innate immunity is preserved in XHM-ED patients because APCs retain the capacity to respond to stimulation by lipopolysaccharide or Staphylococcus:__entity__ aureus:__entity__ Cowan:__entity__ 's:__entity__ antigen:__entity__ ( SAC:__entity__ ) .
Overall , the phenotype observed in XHM-ED patients shows that the putative:__entity__ zinc-finger:__entity__ domain:__entity__ of NEMO:__entity__ has a regulatory function and demonstrates the definite requirement of CD40:__entity__ -mediated NF-kappaB activation for B cell immunoglobulin class-switching .
Granulocytic differentiation of human NB4 promyelocytic leukemia cells induced by all-trans retinoic acid metabolites .
The metabolism of all-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) has been reported to be partly responsible for the in vivo resistance to ATRA seen in the treatment of human acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) .
However , ATRA metabolism appears to be involved in the growth inhibition of several cancer cell lines in vitro .
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of the principal metabolites of ATRA [ 4-hydroxy-retinoic acid ( 4-OH-RA ) , 18-hydroxy-retinoic acid ( 18-OH-RA ) , 4-oxo-retinoic acid ( 4-oxo-RA ) , and 5 , 6-epoxy-retinoic acid ( 5 , 6-epoxy-RA ) ] in NB4 , a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line that exhibits the APL diagnostic t ( 15 ; 17 ) chromosomal translocation and expresses the PML-RAR:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ fusion:__entity__ protein:__entity__ .
We established that the four ATRA metabolites were indeed formed by the NB4 cells in vitro .
NB4 cell growth was inhibited ( 69-78 % at 120 h ) and cell cycle progression in the G1 phase ( 82-85 % at 120 h ) was blocked by ATRA and all of the metabolites at 1 microM concentration .
ATRA and its metabolites could induce NB4 cells differentiation with similar activity , as evaluated by cell morphology , by the nitroblue tetrazolium reduction test ( 82-88 % at 120 h ) or by the expression of the maturation:__entity__ specific:__entity__ cell:__entity__ surface:__entity__ marker:__entity__ CD11c:__entity__ .
In addition , nuclear body reorganization to macropunctated structures , as well as the degradation of PML-RAR:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ , was found to be similar for ATRA and all of its metabolites .
Comparison of the relative potency of the retinoids using the nitroblue tetrazolium reduction test showed effective concentrations required to differentiate 50 % of cells in 72 h as follows : ATRA , 15.8 +/- 1.7 nM ; 4-oxo-RA , 38.3 +/- 1.3 nM ; 18-OH-RA , 55.5 +/- 1.8 nM ; 4-OH-RA , 79.8 +/- 1.8 nM ; and 5 , 6-epoxy-RA , 99.5 +/- 1.5 nM .
The ATRA metabolites were found to exert their differentiation effects via the RAR:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ nuclear:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ , because the RAR alpha-specific antagonist BMS614 blocked metabolite-induced CD11c expression in NB4 cells .
These data demonstrate that the principal ATRA Phase 1 metabolites can elicit leukemia cell growth inhibition and differentiation in vitro through the RAR alpha signaling pathway , and they suggest that these metabolites may play a role in ATRA antileukemic activity in vivo .
Expression of oestrogen:__entity__ and:__entity__ progesterone:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ by mast cells alone , but not lymphocytes , macrophages or other immune cells in human upper airways .
BACKGROUND : Nasal polyposis often coexists with asthma in airway inflammatory conditions characterised by the infiltration of a range of immune cells .
A potentially important role for ovarian hormones has been implicated in airway inflammation but the cellular target for such action is not known .
METHODS : Expression of oestrogen:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ ( ER:__entity__ ) and progesterone:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ ( PR:__entity__ ) was examined using immunohistochemistry in formalin fixed nasal polyp tissues from 47 subjects .
The cells positive for ER:__entity__ or PR:__entity__ were confirmed by spatial location , dual immunolabelling , and histochemical staining .
RESULTS : Consistent with the known features of nasal polyps , CD4+ ( T helper/inducer ) , CD8+ ( cytotoxic/suppressor ) , CD68+ ( macrophages ) , mast cells , eosinophils and neutrophils were all clearly detected by their relevant monoclonal:__entity__ antibodies:__entity__ or appropriate histochemical staining , but only mast cells tested positive for ER:__entity__ /PR labelling with their polyclonal:__entity__ and:__entity__ monoclonal:__entity__ antibodies:__entity__ .
The frequencies for expression were 61.7 % for ER positive and 59.6 % for PR positive cells .
The expression of ER:__entity__ / PR:__entity__ was independent of patient sex and age but was highly correlated with the numbers of mast cells ( r = 0.973 , p < 0.001 for ER:__entity__ ; r = 0.955 , p < 0.001 for PR:__entity__ ) .
Fewer than 5 % of mast cells were found to be negative for ER:__entity__ / PR:__entity__ expression .
CONCLUSIONS : Mast cells alone , but not lymphocytes , macrophages , or other immune cells , express ER:__entity__ / PR:__entity__ in human upper airways .
Numerous ER/PR positive mast cells exist in nasal polyps , indicating that this may be a major route for the involvement of sex hormones in airway inflammation when exposed to the higher and varying concentration of oestrogen and progesterone characteristic of females .
NF kappa b signaling in posthypoxic endothelial cells : relevance to E-selectin expression and neutrophil adhesion .
Our previous studies have implicated the nuclear transcription factor kappa B ( NF:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ ) in the regulation of adhesion:__entity__ molecule:__entity__ expression in endothelial cells exposed to anoxia-reoxygenation ( A/R ) or a redox imbalance .
The objectives of this study were ( 1 ) to define the kinetics of NF:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ activation by examining I kappa B alpha degradation and the nuclear translocation of p65:__entity__ in response to A/R or redox imbalance ( induced by treatment of cells with diamide and buthionine sulfoximine ) and ( 2 ) to determine whether the signal for I kappa B alpha degradation , nuclear translocation of p65:__entity__ , and E-selectin:__entity__ -mediated neutrophil adhesion is related to the activity of protein:__entity__ tyrosine:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ ( PTK:__entity__ ) , protein:__entity__ tyrosine:__entity__ phosphatase:__entity__ ( PTPase:__entity__ ) and/or protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ C:__entity__ ( PKC:__entity__ ) .
The results demonstrate that both A/R and redox imbalance led to I kappa B alpha degradation within 30 min and the concomitant appearance of p65:__entity__ in the nucleus , consistent with rapid cytosolic activation of NF:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ and subsequent nuclear translocation of the activated:__entity__ p65:__entity__ subunit:__entity__ .
Inhibition of PKC:__entity__ blocked I:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ degradation and p65:__entity__ translocation in A/R-challenged , but not redox-altered , endothelial cells .
However , both A/R- and redox-induced NF kappa B activation was blocked by inhibition of PTK:__entity__ .
Similarly , A/R-induced E-selectin expression and neutrophil-endothelial cell adhesion were blocked by inhibition of PKC:__entity__ or PTK:__entity__ , while only PTK:__entity__ inhibited the redox-induced adhesion response .
Pretreatment of cells with N-acetyl cysteine effectively blocked A/R- or redox-induced I kappa B degradation and significantly attenuated the respective neutrophil adhesion responses .
Collectively , these findings indicate that A/R-induced E-selectin expression and neutrophil-endothelial cell adhesion are mediated by both PKC:__entity__ and PTK:__entity__ , which signal rapid activation of NF:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ .
This A/R-induced NF:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ signaling response appears to be mediated , at least in part , by intracellular redox imbalance .

Induction of apoptosis in human lymphocytes by the herbicide 2 , 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid .
Dimethylammonium salt of 2 , 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid ( DMA-2 , 4-D ) is a widely used herbicide that is considered moderately toxic .
In the present study we found that DMA-2 , 4-D is able to cause apoptosis in peripheral blood lymphocytes of healthy individuals and Jurkat T cells .
Apoptosis induced by DMA-2 , 4-D was dose and time dependent , independent of Fas:__entity__ , TNF:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ 1:__entity__ or the aromatic:__entity__ hydrocarbon:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ , and involved disruption of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and activation of caspase-9:__entity__ .
ZVAD-FMK , a broad-spectrum inhibitor of caspases:__entity__ , blocked DMA-2 , 4-D-induced apoptosis completely .
While an inhibitor of caspase-9:__entity__ , as well as caspase-9:__entity__ and caspase-3 inhibitors in combination , strongly blocked DMA-2 , 4-D-induced apoptosis , an inhibitor of caspase-3:__entity__ had a moderate inhibitory effect .
Unlike Fas:__entity__ -mediated apoptosis , the initiator:__entity__ caspase:__entity__ , caspase-8:__entity__ , was not involved in DMA-2 , 4-D-induced apoptosis .
Transfection of Jurkat cells with Bcl-2:__entity__ prevented DMA-2 , 4-D-induced disruption of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and led to a complete blockage of apoptosis .
Our data indicate that DMA-2 , 4-D kills human lymphocytes by initiating apoptosis via a direct effect on mitochondria .
The activation of caspases:__entity__ occurs downstream of mitochondrial damage , and the dysfunction of mitochondria appears to be sufficient for triggering all downstream events leading to apoptosis .
Inhibition of Th1 differentiation by IL-6:__entity__ is mediated by SOCS1:__entity__ .
Interleukin:__entity__ 6:__entity__ ( IL-6:__entity__ ) is a cytokine:__entity__ produced by immune and nonimmune cells and exhibits functional pleiotropy and redundancy .
IL-6:__entity__ plays an important role in the differentiation of several cell types .
Here , we describe a novel function of IL-6:__entity__ : the negative regulation of CD4:__entity__ + Th1 cell differentiation .
While IL-6:__entity__ -directed CD4:__entity__ + Th2 differentiation is mediated by IL-4:__entity__ , inhibition of Th1 differentiation by IL-6:__entity__ is independent of IL-4:__entity__ .
IL-6:__entity__ upregulates suppressor:__entity__ of:__entity__ cytokine:__entity__ signaling:__entity__ 1:__entity__ ( SOCS1:__entity__ ) expression in activated CD4+ T cells , thereby interfering with signal:__entity__ transducer:__entity__ and:__entity__ activator:__entity__ of:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ 1:__entity__ ( STAT1:__entity__ ) phosphorylation induced by interferon:__entity__ gamma:__entity__ ( IFNgamma:__entity__ ) .
Inhibition of IFNgamma:__entity__ receptor-mediated signals by IL-6:__entity__ prevents autoregulation of IFNgamma:__entity__ gene:__entity__ expression by IFNgamma:__entity__ during CD4+ T cell activation , thereby preventing Th1 differentiation .
Thus , IL-6:__entity__ promotes CD4:__entity__ + Th2 differentiation and inhibits Th1 differentiation by two independent molecular mechanisms .
Interaction between CCAAT/enhancer:__entity__ binding:__entity__ protein:__entity__ and cyclic:__entity__ AMP:__entity__ response:__entity__ element:__entity__ binding:__entity__ protein:__entity__ 1:__entity__ regulates human immunodeficiency virus type 1 transcription in cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage .
Recent observations have shown two CCAAT/enhancer:__entity__ binding:__entity__ protein:__entity__ (:__entity__ C/EBP:__entity__ ):__entity__ binding:__entity__ sites:__entity__ to be critically important for efficient human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) replication within cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage , a cell type likely involved in transport of the virus to the brain .
Additionally , sequence variation at C/EBP:__entity__ site:__entity__ I:__entity__ , which lies immediately upstream of the distal:__entity__ nuclear:__entity__ factor:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ site:__entity__ and immediately downstream of a binding site for activating:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ ( ATF:__entity__ ) / cyclic:__entity__ AMP:__entity__ response:__entity__ element:__entity__ binding:__entity__ protein:__entity__ ( CREB:__entity__ ) , has been shown to affect HIV-1:__entity__ long:__entity__ terminal:__entity__ repeat:__entity__ ( LTR:__entity__ ) activity .
Given that C/EBP:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ have been shown to interact with many other transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ including members of the ATF/CREB:__entity__ family:__entity__ , we proceeded to determine whether an adjacent ATF/CREB:__entity__ binding:__entity__ site:__entity__ could affect C/EBP:__entity__ protein:__entity__ binding to C/EBP:__entity__ site:__entity__ I:__entity__ .
Electrophoretic mobility shift analyses indicated that selected ATF/CREB:__entity__ site:__entity__ variants:__entity__ assisted in the recruitment of C/EBP:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ to an adjacent , naturally occurring , low-affinity C/EBP:__entity__ site:__entity__ .
This biophysical interaction appears to occur via at least two mechanisms .
First , low amounts of CREB-1:__entity__ and C/EBP:__entity__ appear to heterodimerize and bind to a site consisting of a half site from both the ATF/CREB:__entity__ and:__entity__ C/EBP:__entity__ binding:__entity__ sites:__entity__ .
In addition , CREB-1:__entity__ homodimers:__entity__ bind to the ATF/CREB:__entity__ site:__entity__ and recruit C/EBP:__entity__ dimers:__entity__ to their cognate weak:__entity__ binding:__entity__ sites:__entity__ .
This interaction is reciprocal , since C/EBP:__entity__ dimer:__entity__ binding to a strong C/EBP:__entity__ site:__entity__ leads to enhanced CREB-1:__entity__ recruitment to ATF/CREB:__entity__ sites:__entity__ that are weakly bound by CREB:__entity__ .
Sequence variation at both C/EBP:__entity__ and:__entity__ ATF/CREB:__entity__ sites:__entity__ affects the molecular interactions involved in mediating both of these mechanisms .
Most importantly , sequence variation at the ATF/CREB:__entity__ binding:__entity__ site:__entity__ affected basal LTR:__entity__ activity as well as LTR:__entity__ function following interleukin-6:__entity__ stimulation , a treatment that leads to increases in C/EBP activation .
Thus , HIV-1:__entity__ LTR:__entity__ ATF/CREB:__entity__ binding:__entity__ site:__entity__ sequence variation may modulate cellular signaling at the viral:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ through the C/EBP pathway
Selective inhibition of interleukin-4 gene expression in human T cells by aspirin .
Previous studies indicated that aspirin ( acetylsalicylic acid [ ASA ] ) can have profound immunomodulatory effects by regulating cytokine gene expression in several types of cells .
This study is the first in which concentrations of ASA in the therapeutic range were found to significantly reduce interleukin:__entity__ (:__entity__ IL:__entity__ ):__entity__ -4:__entity__ secretion and RNA expression in freshly isolated and mitogen-primed human CD4+ T cells .
In contrast , ASA did not affect IL-13:__entity__ , interferon-gamma:__entity__ , and IL-2:__entity__ expression .
ASA inhibited IL-4:__entity__ , but not IL-2:__entity__ , promoter-driven chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression in transiently transfected Jurkat T cells .
The structurally unrelated nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs indomethacin and flurbiprofen did not affect cytokine gene expression in T cells , whereas the weak cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor salicylic acid was at least as effective as ASA in inhibiting IL-4:__entity__ expression and promoter activity .
The inhibitory effect of ASA on IL-4 transcription was not mediated by decreased nuclear expression of the known salicylate:__entity__ target:__entity__ nuclear:__entity__ factor:__entity__ (:__entity__ NF:__entity__ ):__entity__ -kappaB:__entity__ and was accompanied by reduced binding of an inducible factor to an IL-4:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ region:__entity__ upstream of , but not overlapping , the NF:__entity__ of:__entity__ activated:__entity__ T:__entity__ cells-:__entity__ and:__entity__ NF-kappaB-binding:__entity__ P1:__entity__ element:__entity__ .
It is concluded that anti-inflammatory salicylates , by means of a previously unrecognized mechanism of action , can influence the nature of adaptive immune responses by selectively inhibiting the expression of IL-4:__entity__ , a critical effector of these responses , in CD4+ T cells .
Molecular and cellular mediators of interleukin-1:__entity__ -dependent acute inflammatory arthritis .
OBJECTIVE : To examine the molecular and cellular mechanisms in a model of acute inflammatory monarticular arthritis induced by methylated:__entity__ bovine:__entity__ serum:__entity__ albumin:__entity__ ( mBSA:__entity__ ) and interleukin-1:__entity__ ( IL-1:__entity__ ) .
METHODS : Mice were injected intraarticularly with mBSA:__entity__ on day 0 and subcutaneously with recombinant:__entity__ human:__entity__ IL-1beta:__entity__ on days 0-2 .
At day 7 , knee joints were removed and assessed histologically .
Flow cytometry and RNase protection were used to analyze IL-1:__entity__ -dependent events .
RESULTS : C57BL/6 ( B6 ) , 129/Sv , and ( B6 x 129/ Sv ) F1 hybrid mice , all H-2b strains , were susceptible to mBSA:__entity__ /IL-1-induced arthritis , whereas C3H/HeJ ( H-2k ) mice were not .
B6 mice lacking T and B cells ( RAG1-/- ) or major:__entity__ histocompatibility:__entity__ complex:__entity__ (:__entity__ MHC:__entity__ ):__entity__ class:__entity__ II:__entity__ antigens:__entity__ ( MHCII-/- ) , and B6 mice treated with a CD4+:__entity__ T:__entity__ cell-depleting:__entity__ monoclonal:__entity__ antibody:__entity__ , were resistant to disease .
In contrast , B cell-deficient ( muMT/ muMT ) mice developed arthritis at an incidence and severity similar to that of controls .
RelB-deficient ( RelB-/- ) bone marrow chimeric mice had arthritis that was significantly reduced in incidence and severity .
In B6 mice , flow cytometry demonstrated an IL-1-dependent leukocyte infiltration into the synovial compartment and RNase protection assays revealed induction of messenger:__entity__ RNA:__entity__ ( mRNA:__entity__ ) for the chemokines:__entity__ monocyte:__entity__ chemoattractant:__entity__ protein:__entity__ 1:__entity__ , macrophage:__entity__ inhibitory:__entity__ protein:__entity__ 2:__entity__ ( MIP-2:__entity__ ) , RANTES:__entity__ , MIP-1alpha:__entity__ , and MIP-1beta:__entity__ , in vivo and in vitro .
CONCLUSION : Arthritis induced by mBSA:__entity__ / IL-1:__entity__ is strain specific and dependent on CD4+ T lymphocytes and at least partially on RelB:__entity__ , but not on B lymphocytes or antibody:__entity__ .
IL-1:__entity__ contributes to leukocyte recruitment to the synovium and directly induces chemokine mRNA production by synovial cells .
This model of acute monarticular arthritis is particularly suitable for further investigations into cell-mediated immunity in arthritis and the role of IL-1:__entity__ .
Positive and negative regulation of granulopoiesis by endogenous:__entity__ RARalpha:__entity__ .
Acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) is always associated with chromosomal translocations that disrupt the retinoic:__entity__ acid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ (:__entity__ RARalpha:__entity__ ):__entity__ gene:__entity__ .
Whether these translocations relate to a role for endogenous:__entity__ RARalpha:__entity__ in normal granulopoiesis remains uncertain because most studies addressing this question have used non-physiological overexpression systems .
Granulocyte differentiation in cells derived from RARalpha-deficient ( RARalpha ( -/- ) ) mice was studied and evaluated in the context of agonist-bound:__entity__ and:__entity__ ligand-free:__entity__ RARalpha:__entity__ .
Our results demonstrate that RARalpha:__entity__ is dispensable for granulopoiesis , as RARalpha ( -/- ) mice have a normal granulocyte population despite an impaired ability to respond to retinoids .
However , although it is not absolutely required , RARalpha:__entity__ can bidirectionally modulate granulopoiesis .
RARalpha:__entity__ stimulates differentiation in response to exogenous retinoic acid .
Furthermore , endogenous retinoids control granulopoiesis in vivo , as either vitamin A-deficient mice or animals treated with an RAR antagonist accumulate more immature granulocytes in their bone marrow .
Conversely , RARalpha:__entity__ acts to limit differentiation in the absence of ligand:__entity__ because granulocyte precursors from RARalpha ( -/- ) mice differentiate earlier in culture .
Thus , the block in granulopoiesis exerted by RARalpha:__entity__ fusion:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ expressed in APL cells may correspond to an amplification of a normal function of unliganded:__entity__ RARalpha:__entity__ .
Expression and function of a stem:__entity__ cell:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ for the murine:__entity__ CBFalpha2:__entity__ gene:__entity__ : distinct roles and regulation in natural killer and T cell development .
The Runt:__entity__ family:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ CBFalpha2:__entity__ ( AML1:__entity__ , PEBP2alphaB:__entity__ , or Runx1:__entity__ ) is required by hematopoietic stem cells and expressed at high levels in T-lineage cells .
In human T cells CBFalpha2:__entity__ is usually transcribed from a different:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ ( distal:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ ) than in myeloid cells ( proximal:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ ) , but the developmental and functional significance of this promoter switch has not been known .
Here , we report that both coding:__entity__ and:__entity__ noncoding:__entity__ sequences:__entity__ of the distal:__entity__ 5:__entity__ ':__entity__ end:__entity__ are highly conserved between the human:__entity__ and:__entity__ the:__entity__ murine:__entity__ genes:__entity__ , and the distal:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ is responsible for the overwhelming majority of CBFalpha2 expression in murine hematopoietic stem cells as well as in T cells .
Distal promoter activity is maintained throughout T cell development and at lower levels in B cell development , but downregulated in natural killer cell development .
The distal:__entity__ N-terminal:__entity__ isoform:__entity__ binds to functionally important regulatory:__entity__ sites:__entity__ from known target:__entity__ genes:__entity__ with two- to threefold higher affinity than the proximal:__entity__ N-terminal:__entity__ isoform:__entity__ .
Neither full-length:__entity__ isoform:__entity__ alters growth of a myeloid cell line under nondifferentiating conditions , but the proximal:__entity__ isoform:__entity__ selectively delays mitotic arrest of the cell line under differentiating conditions , resulting in the generation of greater numbers of neutrophils .
Constitutive PI3-K activity is essential for proliferation , but not survival , of Theileria parva-transformed B cells .
Theileria is an intracellular parasite that causes lymphoproliferative disorders in cattle , and infection of leucocytes induces a transformed phenotype similar to tumour cells , but the mechanisms by which the parasite induces this phenotype are not understood .
Here , we show that infected B lymphocytes display constitutive phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3-K ) activity , which appears to be necessary for proliferation , but not survival .
Importantly , we demonstrate that one mechanism by which PI3-K:__entity__ mediates the proliferation of infected B lymphocytes is through the induction of a granulocyte-monocyte:__entity__ colony-stimulating:__entity__ factor:__entity__ ( GM-CSF:__entity__ ) -dependent autocrine loop .
PI3-K:__entity__ induction of GM-CSF:__entity__ appears to be at the transcriptional level and , consistently , we demonstrate that PI3-K:__entity__ is also involved in the constitutive induction of AP-1:__entity__ and NF-kappaB:__entity__ , which characterizes Theileria-infected leucocytes .
Taken together , our results highlight a novel strategy exploited by the intracellular parasite Theileria to induce continued proliferation of its host leucocyte .
Lymphokine:__entity__ dependence of STAT3 activation produced by surface immunoglobulin cross-linking and by phorbol ester plus calcium ionophore treatment in B cells .
Stimulation of B cells by surface:__entity__ immunoglobulin:__entity__ ( sIg:__entity__ ) triggering , or through the mitogenic combination of phorbol ester and calcium ionophore , is accompanied by activation of STAT:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ .
The mechanism responsible for the delayed nuclear accumulation of phosphorylated:__entity__ STAT3:__entity__ was examined in detail , focusing on the role of B:__entity__ cell-derived:__entity__ lymphokines:__entity__ .
sIg:__entity__ -induced activation of STAT3:__entity__ was partially inhibited in B cells obtained from IL-6- or IL-10-deficient mice , and was partially blocked by neutralizing:__entity__ antibodies:__entity__ directed against either of these lymphokines:__entity__ .
sIg:__entity__ -induced STAT3 activation was completely inhibited by combining IL-6-:__entity__ and:__entity__ IL-10-specific:__entity__ neutralizing:__entity__ antibodies:__entity__ , or by adding individual neutralizing:__entity__ antibodies:__entity__ to B cells obtained from lymphokine-deficient animals .
In contrast , IL-10:__entity__ alone appeared to account for STAT3 activation resulting from B cell stimulation with phorbol ester and calcium ionophore .
In keeping with these results , soluble IL-6:__entity__ and IL-10:__entity__ were found in supernatant fluid obtained from stimulated B cells .
This work indicates that a lymphokine pathway is responsible for STAT3 activation that occurs late after B cell stimulation , and points out differences in B cell activation that result from stimulation through the antigen:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ and through pharmacological mimicry of signaling:__entity__ mediators:__entity__ .
Transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ AP-4:__entity__ is a ligand:__entity__ for immunoglobulin-kappa:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ E-box:__entity__ elements:__entity__ .
Immunoglobulin:__entity__ (:__entity__ Ig:__entity__ ):__entity__ -kappa:__entity__ promoters:__entity__ from humans and mice share conserved:__entity__ sequences:__entity__ .
The octamer:__entity__ element:__entity__ is common to all Ig:__entity__ promoters:__entity__ and pivotal for their function .
However , other conserved:__entity__ sequence:__entity__ motifs:__entity__ , that differ between Ig:__entity__ variable:__entity__ gene:__entity__ families:__entity__ , are required for normal promoter function .
These conserved motifs do not stimulate transcription in the absence of an octamer:__entity__ .
One example is an E-box:__entity__ of the E47/E12:__entity__ type:__entity__ (:__entity__ 5'-CAGCTG-3:__entity__ ':__entity__ ):__entity__ , which is found in all promoters of the human:__entity__ and:__entity__ murine:__entity__ Ig-kappa:__entity__ gene:__entity__ subgroups/families:__entity__ , with the exception of subgroups II and VI and their related murine:__entity__ families:__entity__ .
In the present study we show that the ubiquitously expressed transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ AP-4:__entity__ , and not E47:__entity__ , interacts specifically with the kappa:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ E-boxes:__entity__ when tested in electrophoretic mobility-shift assays using nuclear extracts derived from human and murine B-cell lines .
Furthermore , AP-4:__entity__ , unlike E47:__entity__ , did not act as a transactivator:__entity__ , which is in agreement with previous studies on intact kappa:__entity__ promoters:__entity__ , showing that transcription is absent when the octamer:__entity__ element:__entity__ has been mutated .
Based on these data , and the conservation of the 5'-CAGCTG-3:__entity__ ':__entity__ motif:__entity__ among human:__entity__ and:__entity__ murine:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ promoters:__entity__ , we propose that AP-4:__entity__ is the major:__entity__ ligand:__entity__ for Ig-kappa:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ E-boxes:__entity__ .
A 16-mer peptide ( RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK ) from antennapedia preferentially targets the Class I pathway .
Translocation of antigenic peptides into the cytosol of antigen presenting cells facilitates proteosomal processing and loading into Class:__entity__ I:__entity__ molecules:__entity__ for MHC presentation on the cell surface .
The DNA:__entity__ binding:__entity__ domain:__entity__ of the Drosophila:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ ( Antennapedia:__entity__ ) , a 60:__entity__ amino:__entity__ acid:__entity__ protein:__entity__ , is rapidly taken up by cells and has been fused to selected antigens:__entity__ to enhance their immunogenicity .
We now demonstrate that a 16 amino acid peptide from antennapedia can facilitate the cytoplasmic uptake of CTL epitope 9-mer peptides .
Synthetic peptides were made containing the 16-mer antennapedia peptide linked in tandem to the ovalbumin SIINFEKL CTL peptide .
The peptide complex was shown to rapidly internalise into APCs by confocal microscopy .
This peptide induced CTL in C57BL/6 mice and protected them against growth of an ovalbumin expressing tumour cell line ( E.G7-OVA ) .
The ability of the hybrid peptide to be processed and presented by APCs was similar , whether the SIINFEKL sequence was appended at the C-terminus:__entity__ or N-terminus:__entity__ of the Antennapedia peptide .
The production of synthetic peptides containing other CTL peptide epitopes may be useful for priming CTLs in vitro and in vivo
Bone marrow cells promote TH2 polarization and inhibit virus-specific CTL generation .
This laboratory recently reported that human bone marrow cells ( BMC ) inhibit the generation of virus-specific CTL in culture .
The culture supernatants contained increased levels of prostaglandin:__entity__ E:__entity__ (:__entity__ 2:__entity__ ):__entity__ (:__entity__ PGE:__entity__ (:__entity__ 2:__entity__ ):__entity__ ):__entity__ ( shown to favor TH2 cell development ) and also inhibited EBV-CTL effector cell development .
In this study , we obtained PBL from Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) IgG:__entity__ antibody:__entity__ positive kidney transplant recipients ( R ) and their living-related donors ( LRD ) one year after renal transplantation .
EBV-specific CTL were then generated in vitro by stimulating PBL with autologous EBV-transformed B cells ( EBV-B ) in the presence or absence of autologous BMC .
The addition of BMC to the EBV-CTL generation cultures increased the intracellular expression in CD3+ cells of IL-4:__entity__ ,:__entity__ -5:__entity__ ,:__entity__ -6:__entity__ ,:__entity__ -10:__entity__ ,:__entity__ and:__entity__ -13:__entity__ .
These CD3+ cells also expressed increased levels of the TH2:__entity__ associated:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ CCR3:__entity__ .
Inhibition was even observed by preparing EBV-CTL generating cultures in trans-wells that separated the autologous BMC from the PBL + EBV-B .
It was then observed that CD3+ cells obtained after 7 days of culture in the presence of autologous BMC could be used as inhibitors of EBV-CTL generation .
Protein:__entity__ Kinase:__entity__ A:__entity__ ( PKA:__entity__ ) , a cAMP:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ that is involved in the upregulation of TH2:__entity__ cytokine:__entity__ activity , was increased in EBV-CTL cultures by the presence of BMC .
Additionally , IL-4-mediated signal transduction and activation of transcription ( STAT-6:__entity__ ) phosphorylation was slightly increased .
These results show that the BMC inhibition is mediated by soluble:__entity__ factors:__entity__ ( cytokines:__entity__ ) and that cell-cell contact in this autologous system is not required , so that BMC ( at least partially , via cytokine production ) promote TH2 polarization in culture .
Moreover , TH2 cells induced by culturing with autologous BMC directly inhibit EBV-CTL generation , and TH2:__entity__ associated PKA:__entity__ , CCR3:__entity__ , and STAT-6:__entity__ phosphorylation are enhanced by BMC .
Reduction in DNA binding activity of the transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ Pax-5a:__entity__ in B lymphocytes of aged mice .
Aging has been associated with intrinsic changes of the humoral immune response , which may lead to an increased occurrence of autoimmune disorders and pathogenic susceptibility .
The transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ Pax-5:__entity__ is a key regulator of B cell development .
Pax-5a/B:__entity__ cell-specific:__entity__ activator:__entity__ protein:__entity__ and an alternatively:__entity__ spliced:__entity__ isoform:__entity__ ,:__entity__ Pax-5d:__entity__ , may have opposing functions in transcriptional regulation due to the lack of a transactivation:__entity__ domain:__entity__ in Pax-5d:__entity__ .
To study B cell -specific changes that occur during the aging process , we investigated expression patterns of Pax-5a:__entity__ and:__entity__ 5d:__entity__ in mature B cells of young and aged mice .
RNase protection assays showed a similar transcriptional pattern for both age groups that indicates that aging has no affect on transcription initiation or alternative splicing for either isoform:__entity__ .
In contrast , a significant reduction in the DNA binding activity of Pax-5a:__entity__ but not Pax-5d:__entity__ protein was observed in aged B cells in vitro , while Western blot analyses showed that similar levels of Pax-5a:__entity__ and:__entity__ 5d:__entity__ proteins were present in both age groups .
The observed decrease in Pax-5a:__entity__ binding activity correlated with changes in expression of two Pax-5:__entity__ target:__entity__ genes:__entity__ in aged B cells .
Expression of the Ig:__entity__ J:__entity__ chain:__entity__ and the secreted form of Ig:__entity__ mu:__entity__ , which are both known to be suppressed by Pax-5a:__entity__ in mature B cells , were increased in B cells of aged mice .
Together , our studies suggest that changes associated with the aging phenotype cause posttranslational modification ( s ) of Pax-5a:__entity__ but not Pax-5d:__entity__ , which may lead to an abnormal B cell phenotype in aged mice , associated with elevated levels of J:__entity__ chain:__entity__ , and secretion of IgM:__entity__
NF-kappa:__entity__ B/Rel:__entity__ participation in the lymphokine-dependent proliferation of T lymphoid cells .
Proliferative responses of lymphoid cells to IL-2:__entity__ and IL-4:__entity__ depend on activation of the cells , but the mechanism ( s ) by which activation enhances cellular competence to respond to cytokines:__entity__ is not fully understood .
The NF-kappaB/Rel:__entity__ family:__entity__ represents one signal transduction pathway induced during such activation .
We show in this study that inhibition of NF-kappaB:__entity__ through the expression of an IkappaBalpha:__entity__ ( inhibitory:__entity__ protein:__entity__ that dissociates from NF-kappaB:__entity__ ) mutant refractory to signal-induced degradation ( IkappaBalpha:__entity__ (:__entity__ DeltaN:__entity__ ):__entity__ ) interfered with the acquisition of competence to proliferate in response to IL-4:__entity__ as well as IL-2:__entity__ .
Thymocytes and T cells from IkappaBalpha:__entity__ (:__entity__ DeltaN:__entity__ ):__entity__ transgenic mice expressed normal levels of IL-2R:__entity__ subunits:__entity__ .
However , transgenic cells exhibited a dramatic defect in Stat5A activation treatment with IL-2:__entity__ , and a similar defect was observed for IL-4:__entity__ -induced Stat5:__entity__ .
In contrast , T lymphoid cells with inhibition of NF-kappaB:__entity__ showed normal insulin receptor substrate-2 phosphorylation and only a modest decrease in Stat6 activation and insulin receptor substrate-1 phosphorylation after IL-4 stimulation .
These results indicate that the NF-kappaB/Rel/IkappaBalpha system can regulate cytokine:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ capacitation through effects on the induction of downstream signaling by the Stat:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ family:__entity__ .
BMS-189453 , a novel retinoid receptor antagonist , is a potent testicular toxin .
BMS-189453 is a synthetic retinoid that acts as an antagonist at retinoic:__entity__ acid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ ,:__entity__ beta:__entity__ ,:__entity__ and:__entity__ gamma:__entity__ .
In Sprague Dawley rats at daily oral doses of 15 , 60 , or 240 mg/kg for 1 month , BMS-189453 produced increases in leukocyte counts , alkaline:__entity__ phosphatase:__entity__ and alanine:__entity__ aminotransferase:__entity__ levels , and marked testicular degeneration and atrophy at all doses .
Significant overt signs of toxicity and deaths occurred at 240 mg/kg , whereas body-weight and food-consumption decreases occurred at 60 and 240 mg/kg .
When BMS-189453 was administered to male rats at daily doses ranging from 12.5 to 100 mg/kg for 1 week , only minimal testicular changes occurred at all doses , shortly after the dosing period .
However , after a 1-month drug-free observation period , marked testicular atrophy was evident at all doses .
BMS-189453 was then administered at doses of 2 , 10 , or 50 mg/kg to male rats for 1 , 3 , or 7 consecutive days .
Dose- and duration-dependent testicular toxicity that occurred after a 1-month observation period did not recover , and , in some cases , was more severe 4 months after the last dose .
In rabbits administered BMS-189453 at oral doses of 2 , 10 , or 50 mg/kg for 1 week , testicular degeneration and atrophy were evident in the high-dose group at 1 month following treatment .
These studies indicate that retinoid antagonists can selectively produce progressive and prolonged testicular toxicity after single or repeated oral doses that are otherwise well tolerated .
Sequential involvement of NFAT:__entity__ and Egr:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ in FasL regulation .
The critical function of NFAT:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ in maintaining lymphoid homeostasis was revealed in mice lacking both NFATp:__entity__ and NFAT4:__entity__ ( DKO ) .
DKO mice exhibit increased lymphoproliferation , decreased activation-induced cell death , and impaired induction of FasL:__entity__ .
The transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ Egr2:__entity__ and Egr3:__entity__ are potent activators of FasL expression .
Here we find that Egr2:__entity__ and Egr3:__entity__ are NFAT:__entity__ target:__entity__ genes:__entity__ .
Activation of FasL:__entity__ occurs via the NFAT:__entity__ -dependent induction of Egr3:__entity__ , as demonstrated by the ability of exogenously provided NFATp:__entity__ to restore Egr:__entity__ -dependent FasL promoter activity in DKO lymph node cells .
Further , Egr3:__entity__ expression is enriched in Th1 cells , suggesting a molecular basis for the known preferential expression of FasL:__entity__ in the Th1 versus Th2 subset .
Mechanisms and clinical relevance of nongenomic glucocorticoid actions .
Glucocorticoids have profound anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive actions when used therapeutically .
The therapeutic dose is quite variable and depends on the disease , but ranges from very low to extremely high .
The rationale for the use of various dosage regimens for specific clinical indications is the existence of three distinct , therapeutically relevant effects : genomic , specific nongenomic and unspecific nongenomic .
Genomic effects are mediated by cytosolic:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ that alter expression of specific genes .
Specific nongenomic effects occur within a few minutes and are mediated by steroid-selective:__entity__ membrane:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ .
Unspecific nongenomic effects occur within seconds , but only at high glucocorticoid dosages , and seem to result from direct interactions with biological membranes .
For unspecific nongenomic effects , methylprednisolone and other glucocorticoids have been shown to inhibit cation cycling across the plasma membrane , but to have little effect on protein synthesis .
Thus , glucocorticoids could diminish or prevent the acute immune response by interfering with processes such as the rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration .
It is proposed that the additional therapeutic benefit of higher doses is obtained via these nongenomic effects .
High glucose-induced intercellular:__entity__ adhesion:__entity__ molecule-1:__entity__ ( ICAM-1:__entity__ ) expression through an osmotic effect in rat mesangial cells is PKC-NF-kappa B-dependent .
AIMS/HYPOTHESIS : Infiltration of mononuclear cells and glomerular enlargement accompanied by glomerular cell proliferation are very early characteristics of the pathophysiology of diabetes .
To clarify the mechanism of early diabetic nephropathy , we measured [ 3H ] -thymidine incorporation and cell numbers to show the influence of a high ambient glucose concentration and the osmotic effect on rat mesangial cell proliferation .
We also measured the effect of high glucose on the expression of intercellular:__entity__ adhesion:__entity__ molecule-1:__entity__ and vascular:__entity__ adhesion:__entity__ molecule-1:__entity__ by flow cytometry and semiquantitative RT-PCR in mesangial cells and the adhesion of leukocytes to mesangial cells .
METHODS/RESULTS : Cells exposed to high D-glucose ( 30 mmol/l ) caused an increase in [ 3H ] -thymidine incorporation and cell numbers at 24 and 48 h and normalized at 72 h ( p < 0.05 ) , whereas these changes were not found in high mannitol ( 30 mmol/l ) , IL-1:__entity__ beta:__entity__ , or TNF:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ -stimulated mesangial cells .
Cells exposed to high-glucose ( 15 , 30 , or 60 mmol/l ) or osmotic agents ( L-glucose , raffinose and mannitol ) showed that intercellular:__entity__ adhesion:__entity__ molecule-1:__entity__ expression began to increase after 24 h , reached its maximum at 24 and 48 h and gradually decreased afterwards .
The stimulatory effects of high glucose and high mannitol on mRNA expression were observed as early as 6 h and reached its maximum at 12 h .
Up-regulation of ICAM-1:__entity__ protein and mRNA was also found in IL-1-beta:__entity__ and TNF-alpha:__entity__ -stimulated mesangial cells .
Neither vascular:__entity__ adhesion:__entity__ molecule-1:__entity__ protein nor mRNA expression was , however , affected by high glucose and high mannitol .
Notably , the protein kinase C inhibitors calphostin C and staurosporine reduced high glucose- or high mannitol-induced intercellular:__entity__ adhesion:__entity__ molecule-1:__entity__ mRNA expression and high glucose-induced proliferation .
Furthermore , the NF-kappa B inhibitor N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone reduced high glucose- or high mannitol-induced intercellular:__entity__ adhesion:__entity__ molecule-1:__entity__ mRNA expression and high glucose-induced proliferation .
Results showed that high glucose ( 15 , 30 mmol/l ) or high concentrations of osmotic agents remarkably increased the number of adherent leukocytes to mesangial cells ( p < 0.01 ) compared with control cells ( 5 mmol/l D-glucose ) .
Functional blocking of intercellular:__entity__ adhesion:__entity__ molecule-1:__entity__ on mesangial cells with rat:__entity__ intercellular:__entity__ adhesion:__entity__ molecule-1:__entity__ monoclonal:__entity__ antibody:__entity__ , calphostin C , staurosporine , or N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone significantly inhibited high glucose- or high mannitol-induced increase in leukocyte adhesion ( p < < 0.05 ) .
CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION : These results suggest that high glucose can upregulate intercellular:__entity__ adhesion:__entity__ molecule-1:__entity__ protein and mRNA expression but not vascular adhesion molecule-1 expression in mesangial cells and promote leukocyte adhesion through up-regulation of intercellular:__entity__ adhesion:__entity__ molecule-1:__entity__ through osmotic effect , possibly depending on the protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ C:__entity__ nuclear:__entity__ factor-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ ( PKC:__entity__ - NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ ) pathway .
High glucose itself can also promote mesangial cell proliferation through the PKC-NF-kappa B pathways .
We conclude that hyperglycaemia in itself seems to be an important factor in the development of early diabetic nephropathy .
Combined corticosteroid/ granulocyte:__entity__ colony-stimulating:__entity__ factor:__entity__ ( G-CSF:__entity__ ) therapy in the treatment of severe congenital neutropenia unresponsive to G-CSF:__entity__ : Activated glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ synergize with G-CSF:__entity__ signals .
More than 90 % of patients with severe congenital neutropenia ( SCN ) respond to granulocyte:__entity__ colony-stimulating:__entity__ factor:__entity__ ( G-CSF:__entity__ ) therapy .
The basis for the refractory state in the remaining patients is unknown .
To address this issue , we studied a child with SCN who was totally unresponsive to G-CSF:__entity__ and had a novel point mutation in the extracellular:__entity__ domain:__entity__ of the G-CSF:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ ( GCSF-R:__entity__ ) .
Marrow stromal support of granulopoiesis was evaluated by plating CD34 ( + ) cells on preformed stromal layers .
Nonadherent cells were harvested and assayed in clonogenic assays for granulocytic colony production .
The in vitro effect of G-CSF:__entity__ and corticosteroids on granulopoiesis was evaluated in clonogenic assays of marrow mononuclear cells , by proliferation studies of the murine myeloid cell line 32D expressing the patient 's mutated:__entity__ G-CSFR:__entity__ , and by measuring STAT5 activation in nuclear extracts from stimulated cells .
Patient 's stroma supported granulopoiesis derived from control marrow CD34 ( + ) cells in a normal manner .
Normal stroma , however , failed to induce granulopoiesis from patient 's CD34 ( + ) cells .
Clonogenic assays of the patient 's marrow mononuclear cells incorporating either G-CSF:__entity__ or hydrocortisone produced little neutrophil growth .
In contrast , inclusion of both G-CSF:__entity__ and hydrocortisone in the cytokine:__entity__ ``:__entity__ cocktail:__entity__ '':__entity__ markedly increased the neutrophil numbers .
Proliferation of 32D cells expressing the mutated:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ and STAT5 activation were improved by a combination of G-CSF:__entity__ and dexamethasone .
When small daily doses of oral prednisone were then administered to the patient with conventional doses of subcutaneous:__entity__ G-CSF:__entity__ , the patient responded with increased neutrophil numbers and with a complete reversal of the infectious problems .
These data provide insight into SCN unresponsive to standard G-CSF:__entity__ treatment and to the potential corrective action of combined treatment with G-CSF:__entity__ and corticosteroids through synergistic activation of STAT5:__entity__ .
Human renal mesangial cells are a target for the anti-inflammatory action of 9-cis retinoic acid .
Mesangial cells play an active role in the inflammatory response to glomerular injury .
We have studied in cultured human mesangial cells ( CHMC ) several effects of 9-cis retinoic acid ( 9-cRA ) , an activator of both retinoic:__entity__ acid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ ( RARs:__entity__ ) and retinoid:__entity__ X:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ ( RXRs:__entity__ ) .
9-cRA inhibited foetal calf serum-induced CHMC proliferation .
It also prevented CHMC death induced by the inflammatory mediator H ( 2 ) O ( 2 ) .
This preventive effect was not due to any increase in H ( 2 ) O ( 2 ) catabolism and it persisted even when both catalase and glutathione synthesis were inhibited .
Finally , 9-cRA diminished monocyte adhesion to FCS-stimulated CHMC .
Interestingly , the retinoid also inhibited in FCS-stimulated cells the protein expression of two mesangial:__entity__ adhesion:__entity__ molecules:__entity__ , fibronectin:__entity__ and osteopontin:__entity__ , but it did not modify the protein expression of intercellular:__entity__ adhesion:__entity__ molecule-1:__entity__ and vascular:__entity__ adhesion:__entity__ molecule-1:__entity__ .
All major RARs:__entity__ and:__entity__ RXRs:__entity__ isotypes:__entity__ were expressed in CHMC regardless of the presence or absence of 9-cRA .
Transcripts to RAR-alpha:__entity__ , RAR-beta:__entity__ and RXR-alpha:__entity__ increased after incubation with 9-cRA whereas RXR-gamma:__entity__ was inhibited , suggesting a major role for RARs:__entity__ and RXRs:__entity__ in 9-cRA-anti-inflammatory effects .
9-cRA was toxic only at 50 microM ( a concentration 50 - 5000 times higher than required for the effects above ) .
Cell death occurred by apoptosis , whose onset was associated with a pronounced increase in catalase activity and reduced glutathione content , being more effectively induced by all-trans retinoic acid .
Modulation of the oxidant/antioxidant balance failed to inhibit apoptosis .
We conclude that mesangial cells might be a target for the treatment of inflammatory glomerulopathies with 9-cRA .
Expression of mammalian:__entity__ defensin:__entity__ genes:__entity__ .
Antimicrobial peptides are a prevalent mechanism of host defense found throughout nature .
In mammals , defensins:__entity__ are among the most abundant of these broad-spectrum antibiotics , and are expressed in epithelial and hematopoietic cells .
The defensin peptides are especially abundant in neutrophils ; however , gene expression is limited to the promyelocyte stage .
In epithelial cells , defensin:__entity__ genes:__entity__ are found as both constitutively expressed and inducible .
Induction has been observed in vitro by stimulation with bacterial lipopolysaccharide as well as inflammatory mediators .
In vivo , up-regulation of several defensin:__entity__ genes:__entity__ occurs in both infectious and inflammatory states .
Gene regulation occurs via signal transduction pathways common to other innate immune responses , utilizing transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ such as nuclear:__entity__ factor:__entity__ (:__entity__ NF:__entity__ ):__entity__ -kappaB:__entity__ and NF:__entity__ interleukin-6:__entity__ .
Together , the data suggest a broad-based innate host defense whereby potent antimicrobial peptides are present to prevent initial colonization by pathogenic microorganisms .
In addition , the recognition of bacteria coupled with a nascent inflammatory response can bolster this defense by a coordinated up-regulation of the peptides .
Multiple signals required for cyclic:__entity__ AMP-responsive:__entity__ element:__entity__ binding:__entity__ protein:__entity__ ( CREB:__entity__ ) binding protein interaction induced by CD3/CD28 costimulation .
The optimal activation of cAMP-responsive:__entity__ element:__entity__ binding:__entity__ protein:__entity__ ( CREB:__entity__ ) , similar to the full activation of T lymphocytes , requires the stimulation of both CD3:__entity__ and CD28:__entity__ .
Using a reporter system to detect interaction of CREB:__entity__ and CREB-binding:__entity__ protein:__entity__ ( CBP:__entity__ ) , in this study we found that CREB:__entity__ binds to CBP:__entity__ only by engagement of both CD3:__entity__ and CD28:__entity__ .
CD3/CD28:__entity__ -promoted CREB:__entity__ - CBP:__entity__ interaction was dependent on p38:__entity__ mitogen-activated:__entity__ protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ ( MAPK:__entity__ ) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent:__entity__ protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ (:__entity__ CaMK:__entity__ ):__entity__ IV:__entity__ in addition to the previously identified extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway .
Extracellular:__entity__ signal-regulated:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ ,:__entity__ CaMKIV:__entity__ , and p38:__entity__ MAPK:__entity__ were also the kinases involved in CREB:__entity__ Ser ( 133 ) phosphorylation induced by CD3/CD28:__entity__ .
A reconstitution experiment illustrated that optimum CREB:__entity__ - CBP:__entity__ interaction and CREB:__entity__ trans-activation were attained when these three kinase pathways were simultaneously activated in T cells .
Our results demonstrate that coordinated activation of different kinases:__entity__ leads to full activation of CREB:__entity__ .
Notably , CD28 ligation activated p38:__entity__ MAPK:__entity__ and CaMKIV:__entity__ , the kinases:__entity__ stimulated by CD3 engagement , suggesting that CD28:__entity__ acts by increasing the activation extent of p38:__entity__ MAPK:__entity__ and CaMKIV:__entity__ .
These results support the model of a minimum activation threshold for CREB:__entity__ - CBP:__entity__ interaction that can be reached only when both CD3:__entity__ and CD28:__entity__ are stimulated .
The murine:__entity__ IL-2:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ contains distal:__entity__ regulatory:__entity__ elements:__entity__ responsive to the Ah:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ , a member of the evolutionarily conserved bHLH-PAS:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ family:__entity__ .
Signaling through the TCR:__entity__ and costimulatory signals primarily control transcription of the IL-2:__entity__ gene:__entity__ in naive T cells .
The minimal:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ necessary for this expression lies proximal , between -300 and the transcription:__entity__ start:__entity__ site:__entity__ .
We had previously shown that activation of the arylhydrocarbon:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ ( AHR:__entity__ ) , a member of the bHLH-PAS:__entity__ family:__entity__ of:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ , leads to increased mRNA expression of IL-2:__entity__ in murine fetal thymocytes .
The AHR:__entity__ is abundant in the thymus and may play a role for the development of the immune system .
Moreover , its overactivation by chemicals such as dioxins leads to immunosuppression and thymic involution .
Binding motifs for the liganded:__entity__ AHR:__entity__ can be identified in the distal:__entity__ region:__entity__ -1300:__entity__ to:__entity__ -800:__entity__ of the mouse:__entity__ IL-2:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ .
We show here that these DNA:__entity__ motifs:__entity__ , the so-called dioxin:__entity__ response:__entity__ elements:__entity__ , after binding to the liganded:__entity__ AHR:__entity__ are sufficient to transactivate luciferase expression in a reporter gene system .
The IL-2:__entity__ gene:__entity__ can be induced by the AHR:__entity__ also in thymocytes in vivo after injection of 2 , 3 , 7 , 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin , a potent ligand of the AHR:__entity__ .
The AHR:__entity__ mediates the IL-2 induction as shown with AHR:__entity__ -deficient mice .
However , in spleen cells in vitro costimulation via the TCR:__entity__ is necessary for optimal IL-2:__entity__ gene:__entity__ induction .
Thus , the IL-2:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ region:__entity__ contains novel distal:__entity__ regulatory:__entity__ elements:__entity__ that can be addressed by the AHR:__entity__ to induce IL-2:__entity__ and can cooperate with the proximal:__entity__ promoter:__entity__
Visualization of Syk-antigen:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ interactions using green:__entity__ fluorescent:__entity__ protein:__entity__ : differential roles for Syk:__entity__ and Lyn:__entity__ in the regulation of receptor capping and internalization .
The cross-linking of the B:__entity__ cell:__entity__ Ag:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ ( BCR:__entity__ ) is coupled to the stimulation of multiple intracellular signal transduction cascades via receptor-associated , protein:__entity__ tyrosine:__entity__ kinases:__entity__ of both the Src:__entity__ and:__entity__ Syk:__entity__ families:__entity__ .
To monitor changes in the subcellular distribution of Syk:__entity__ in B cells responding to BCR:__entity__ cross-linking , we expressed in Syk:__entity__ -deficient DT40 B cells a fusion:__entity__ protein:__entity__ consisting of Syk:__entity__ coupled to green:__entity__ fluorescent:__entity__ protein:__entity__ .
Treatment of these cells with anti-IgM:__entity__ Abs:__entity__ leads to the recruitment of the kinase:__entity__ from cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments to the site of the cross-linked:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ at the plasma membrane .
The Syk-receptor:__entity__ complexes:__entity__ aggregate into membrane patches that redistribute to form a cap at one pole of the cell .
Syk:__entity__ is not demonstrably associated with the internalized:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ .
Catalytically active Syk:__entity__ promotes and stabilizes the formation of tightly:__entity__ capped:__entity__ BCR:__entity__ complexes:__entity__ at the plasma membrane .
Lyn:__entity__ is not required for the recruitment of Syk:__entity__ to the cross-linked:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ , but is required for the internalization of the clustered BCR:__entity__ complexes:__entity__ .
In the absence of Lyn:__entity__ , receptor-Syk:__entity__ complexes:__entity__ at the plasma membrane are long lived , and the receptor-mediated activation of the NF-AT:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ is enhanced .
Thus , Lyn:__entity__ appears to function to negatively regulate aspects of BCR:__entity__ -dependent signaling by stimulating receptor internalization and down-regulation .
Renal interstitial fibrosis is reduced in angiotensin:__entity__ II:__entity__ type:__entity__ 1a:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ -deficient mice .
Unilateral ureteral obstruction ( UUO ) results in tubulointerstitial fibrosis of the affected kidney by stimulating the renin-angiotensin system .
This study established a UUO model in angiotensin:__entity__ type:__entity__ 1a:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ ( AT1a:__entity__ ) deficient ( mutant ) mice to elucidate the role of angiotensin:__entity__ II:__entity__ through AT1a:__entity__ on the fibrosis of the obstructed kidney ( OBK ) .
The relative volume of the tubulointerstitium was measured by an image analyzer ; deposition of collagen:__entity__ types:__entity__ III:__entity__ and:__entity__ IV:__entity__ and monocyte / macrophage infiltration were histologically examined using specific:__entity__ antibodies:__entity__ .
Also determined were the mRNA levels of transforming:__entity__ growth:__entity__ factor-beta:__entity__ by Northern blot analysis .
Nuclear:__entity__ factor-kappaB:__entity__ activity was assessed by gel shift assay .
UUO in wild mice resulted in a marked expansion of relative volume of the tubulointerstitium , together with increased deposition of collagen:__entity__ types:__entity__ III:__entity__ and:__entity__ IV:__entity__ and number of infiltrated monocytes / macrophages in the interstitium , relative to sham-operated mice .
In comparison , these changes were significantly lower in mutant mice with UUO .
The mRNA level of transforming:__entity__ growth:__entity__ factor-beta:__entity__ was significantly higher in the OBK of wild mice with UUO compared with sham-operated mice .
In contrast , the increase in mRNA level in the OBK of mutant mice was significantly less than in wild mice .
Finally , UUO resulted in activation of nuclear:__entity__ factor-kappaB:__entity__ in wild mice but was inhibited in the OBK of mutant mice .
The results provide direct evidence that angiotensin:__entity__ II:__entity__ acting via the AT1a:__entity__ plays a pivotal role in the development of tubulointerstitial fibrosis in UUO .
HLA-DQ:__entity__ tetramers:__entity__ identify epitope-specific T cells in peripheral blood of herpes simplex virus type 2-infected individuals : direct detection of immunodominant antigen-responsive cells .
Ag-specific CD4+ T cells are present in peripheral blood in low frequency , where they undergo recruitment and expansion during immune responses and in the pathogenesis of numerous autoimmune diseases .
MHC:__entity__ tetramers:__entity__ , which constitute a labeled:__entity__ MHC-peptide:__entity__ ligand:__entity__ suitable for binding to the Ag-specific:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ on T cells , provide a novel approach for the detection and characterization of such rare cells .
In this study , we utilized this technology to identify HLA:__entity__ DQ:__entity__ -restricted Ag-specific T cells in the peripheral blood of human subjects and to identify immunodominant epitopes associated with viral infection .
Peptides representing potential epitope:__entity__ regions:__entity__ of the VP16:__entity__ protein:__entity__ from HSV-2 were loaded onto recombinant:__entity__ DQ0602:__entity__ molecules:__entity__ to generate a panel of Ag-specific:__entity__ DQ0602:__entity__ tetramers:__entity__ .
VP16:__entity__ Ag:__entity__ -specific DQ-restricted T cells were identified and expanded from the peripheral blood of HSV-2-infected individuals , representing two predominant epitope specificities .
Although the VP16 369-380 peptide has a lower binding affinity for DQ0602:__entity__ molecules:__entity__ than the VP16 33-52 peptide , T cells that recognized the VP16 369-380 peptide occurred at a much higher frequency than those that were specific for the VP16 33-52 peptide .
Down-regulation of BOB.1/OBF.1:__entity__ and Oct2:__entity__ in classical Hodgkin disease but not in lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin disease correlates with immunoglobulin transcription .
In contrast to the tumor cells ( L & H cells ) of lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin disease ( LPHD ) , Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg ( HRS ) cells of classical Hodgkin disease ( cHD ) are unable to transcribe immunoglobulin:__entity__ , despite the presence of rearranged:__entity__ immunoglobulin:__entity__ genes:__entity__ .
Although initial studies have suggested crippling immunoglobulin gene mutations to be the cause of absent immunoglobulin expression in cHD , recent work of our group has demonstrated an impaired activation of the immunoglobulin:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ as a superior mechanism .
As immunoglobulin transcription is mainly regulated by the B-cell:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ Oct2:__entity__ and BOB.1/OBF.1:__entity__ , we analyzed 35 cases of LPHD , 32 cases of cHD , and 2 Hodgkin disease cell lines for the expression of these transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ and also in parallel for immunoglobulin expression .
Our results demonstrate an absence of Oct2:__entity__ and/or BOB.1/OBF.1:__entity__ in cHD and a striking overexpression of Oct2:__entity__ in LPHD .
Immunoglobulin expression was lacking in cHD but present in LPHD .
Furthermore , the reintroduction of BOB.1/OBF.1:__entity__ and Oct2:__entity__ into cultured HRS cells restored the activity of cotransduced immunoglobulin:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ constructs:__entity__ .
Our findings dismiss the concept that the different immunoglobulin expression in cHD and LPHD is due to disrupting mutations of immunoglobulin:__entity__ V:__entity__ genes:__entity__ in cHD but is most likely due to a down-regulation of Oct2:__entity__ and/or BOB.1/OBF.1:__entity__ .
This study further revealed Oct2:__entity__ as a new and valuable marker for the identification of L & H cells and their distinction from HRS cells .
The impairment of immunoglobulin transcription with a down-regulated synthesis of Oct2:__entity__ and BOB.1/OBF.1:__entity__ is the first established general recurrent defect found in HRS cells .
Constitutive expression of NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ is a characteristic feature of mycosis fungoides : implications for apoptosis resistance and pathogenesis .
The NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ family:__entity__ of:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ is an important regulator of genes expressed during inflammatory responses , immunoglobulin ( Ig ) class switching , cellular differentiation , and apoptosis .
Recently , members of the NF-kappaB:__entity__ family:__entity__ , including p65:__entity__ (:__entity__ Rel:__entity__ A:__entity__ ):__entity__ , have been implicated in promoting survival of various hematopoeitic neoplasms , including T cell malignancies such as adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma .
We investigated the expression of active:__entity__ NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ p65:__entity__ (:__entity__ Rel:__entity__ A:__entity__ ):__entity__ in cases of mycosis fungoides ( MF ) and the effect of chemical inhibitors of NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ on apoptosis in cutaneous T cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) cell lines .
Paraffin-embedded tissues from 23 cutaneous lesions and a single lymph node biopsy from patients diagnosed with MF were evaluated for p65 ( Rel A ) expression by using a monoclonal:__entity__ mouse:__entity__ antibody:__entity__ that detects the activated form of p65:__entity__ (:__entity__ Rel:__entity__ A:__entity__ ):__entity__ .
Apoptosis after treatment with the NF-kappa B inhibitors gliotoxin , MG132 , BAY 11-7082 , and BAY 11-7085 was quantitatively measured in the CTCL cell lines HuT-78 and HH by propidium iodide ( PI ) /cell cycle analysis for detection of a hypodiploid ( sub-G ( 0 ) ) population and by determination of increased Annexin V/7-amino-actinomycin D ( 7-AAD ) expression .
Nuclear extracts from CTCL cells before and after chemical inhibition were analyzed for NF-kappa B nuclear DNA-binding activity by electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) with quantitative densitometry .
Nuclear expression of p65:__entity__ (:__entity__ Rel:__entity__ A:__entity__ ):__entity__ before and after treatment with the various inhibitory compounds was measured by immunofluorescence staining in each CTCL cell line .
Neoplastic T lymphocytes from 22 of 24 cases of MF showed strong nuclear and cytoplasmic expression of active:__entity__ p65:__entity__ (:__entity__ Rel:__entity__ A:__entity__ ):__entity__ .
Compared with untreated control cells , a marked increase in apoptosis , a significant decrease in NF-kappa B DNA-binding activity , and a marked decrease in nuclear p65 ( Rel A ) expression were seen in cells from both CTCL cell lines after chemical NF-kappa B inhibition .
These data show that the active form of NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ p65:__entity__ (:__entity__ Rel:__entity__ A:__entity__ ):__entity__ is commonly expressed in neoplastic T lymphocytes in patients with MF .
In CTCL cell lines , the significant decrease in nuclear NF-kappa B expression and the marked increase in spontaneous apoptosis caused by chemical NF-kappa B inhibition suggest a critical role for NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ in the pathogenesis and tumor cell maintenance of CTCLs .
HUM PATHOL 31 : 1482-1490 .
Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 tax:__entity__ protein:__entity__ activates transcription through AP-1:__entity__ site:__entity__ by inducing DNA binding activity in T cells .
Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) Tax:__entity__ protein:__entity__ induces the expression of various family members of the transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ AP-1:__entity__ , such as c-Jun:__entity__ , JunD:__entity__ , c-Fos:__entity__ , and Fra-1:__entity__ , at the level of RNA expression in T cells .
We examined the activity of Tax:__entity__ in transcription through AP-1-binding:__entity__ sites:__entity__ ( AP-1:__entity__ site:__entity__ ) in T cells .
Transient transfection studies showed that Tax:__entity__ activated the expression of a luciferase:__entity__ gene:__entity__ regulated by two copies of an AP-1:__entity__ site:__entity__ in the human Jurkat T-cell line .
Tax:__entity__ activates the expression of viral:__entity__ and:__entity__ cellular:__entity__ genes:__entity__ through two different enhancers : a cAMP-responsive:__entity__ (:__entity__ CRE:__entity__ ):__entity__ -like:__entity__ element:__entity__ and a kappaB:__entity__ element:__entity__ .
Two Tax:__entity__ mutants:__entity__ differentially activated expression of these two elements .
Tax703:__entity__ preferentially activated the kappaB:__entity__ element:__entity__ but not the CRE-like one , whereas TaxM22:__entity__ showed the reverse .
In addition , Tax703:__entity__ and Tax:__entity__ , but not TaxM22:__entity__ , converted cell growth of a mouse T-cell line from being interleukin ( IL ) -2-dependent to being IL-2-independent .
Unlike the wild-type:__entity__ Tax:__entity__ , Tax703:__entity__ and TaxM22:__entity__ only weakly activated the AP-1:__entity__ site:__entity__ in the T-cell line .
Thus , Tax:__entity__ seems to activate the AP-1:__entity__ site:__entity__ via mechanisms distinct from those of kappaB:__entity__ or:__entity__ CRE-like:__entity__ elements:__entity__ , and the activation of the AP-1:__entity__ site:__entity__ is dispensable for IL-2-independent growth of CTLL-2 .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that Tax:__entity__ induced strong binding activity to an AP-1:__entity__ site:__entity__ in CTLL-2 , whereas Tax703:__entity__ did not , indicating that the induction of binding activity to the AP-1:__entity__ site:__entity__ is essential for the transcriptional activation by Tax:__entity__ .
The binding:__entity__ complex:__entity__ induced by Tax:__entity__ in CTLL-2 contained JunD:__entity__ and Fra-2:__entity__ .
Other AP-1:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ were undetectable .
Activation of transcription through the AP-1:__entity__ site:__entity__ in Jurkat cells by JunD:__entity__ and/or Fra-2:__entity__ was weak .
c-Jun:__entity__ , JunB:__entity__ , and c-Fos:__entity__ activation was greater , although the level was still less than that with Tax:__entity__ .
Thus , the induction of AP-1:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ by Tax:__entity__ may not be sufficient for a complete activation of AP-1:__entity__ site:__entity__ by Tax:__entity__ .
Our results suggest that Tax:__entity__ activates the transcription of cellular:__entity__ genes:__entity__ with AP-1:__entity__ sites:__entity__ by inducing the DNA-binding activity of AP-1:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ in T cells , a mechanism distinct from those of CRE-like:__entity__ and:__entity__ kappaB:__entity__ elements:__entity__ .

Strict control of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication by a genetic switch : Tet for Tat .
Live-attenuated human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) variants have shown great promise as AIDS vaccines , but continued replication can lead to the selection of faster-replicating variants that are pathogenic .
We therefore designed HIV-1:__entity__ genomes:__entity__ that replicate exclusively upon addition of the nontoxic effector doxycycline ( dox ) .
This was achieved by replacement of the viral TAR-Tat system for transcriptional activation by the Escherichia coli-derived Tet system for inducible gene expression .
These designer `` HIV-rtTA '' viruses replicate in a strictly dox-dependent manner both in a T-cell line and in primary blood cells , and the rate of replication can be fine-tuned by simple variation of the dox concentration .
These HIV-rtTA viruses provide a tool to perform genetics , e.g. , selection and optimization experiments , with the E. coli-derived Tet reagents in a eukaryotic background .
Furthermore , such viruses may represent improved vaccine candidates because their replication can be turned on and off at will .
Synovial fluid induced nuclear:__entity__ factor-kappaB:__entity__ DNA binding in a monocytic cell line .
OBJECTIVE : To determine the effects of synovial fluids ( SF ) on DNA binding activity of transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ nuclear:__entity__ factor-kappaB:__entity__ ( NF-kappaB:__entity__ ) in the Mono Mac 6 monocytic/macrophage cell line as a model for the interaction between SF and synovial tissue macrophages in arthritis .
METHODS : Mono Mac 6 cells were incubated with SF from the knee joints of human subjects with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , undifferentiated seronegative oligoarthritis , and osteoarthritis ( OA ) .
Nuclear extracts prepared from the Mono Mac 6 cells and RA synovial tissue were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift analysis ( EMSA ) for NF-kappaB:__entity__ DNA:__entity__ binding:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ .
RESULTS : Induction of NF-kappaB:__entity__ DNA binding by the p65:__entity__ (:__entity__ RelA:__entity__ ):__entity__ /p50:__entity__ heterodimer:__entity__ was observed in response to incubation of Mono Mac 6 cells with SF ( 20 % in culture medium ) from 5 of 8 subjects with RA , 4 of 5 with OA , and none of 3 with undifferentiated seronegative oligoarthritis .
Incubation of SF with neutralizing:__entity__ antibodies:__entity__ against tumor:__entity__ necrosis:__entity__ factor-alpha:__entity__ (:__entity__ TNF-alpha:__entity__ ):__entity__ , but not antibodies:__entity__ against interleukin:__entity__ 6:__entity__ (:__entity__ IL-6:__entity__ ):__entity__ , significantly reduced the induction of p65/p50 binding activity in SF from subjects with RA and OA .
Unexpectedly , a slowly migrating SF inducible NF-kappaB:__entity__ -binding complex was observed in EMSA of Mono Mac 6 cells after incubation with SF from 5 of 8 RA and 2 of 5 OA subjects .
The induction of this complex by SF was not affected by neutralization of TNF-alpha:__entity__ or IL-6:__entity__ in SF , and the complex was not inducible by TNF-alpha:__entity__ , IL-1beta , TNF-alpha:__entity__ / IL-1beta:__entity__ , IL-6:__entity__ , platelet:__entity__ derived:__entity__ growth:__entity__ factor:__entity__ , lipopolysaccharide , or tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate .
The slowly migrating:__entity__ complex:__entity__ could not be supershifted with antibodies:__entity__ against NF-kappaB:__entity__ , Jun:__entity__ , or the transcriptional coactivators p300:__entity__ or CBP:__entity__ .
A NF-kappaB-binding:__entity__ complex:__entity__ with similar slow mobility was observed in nuclear extracts prepared from fresh human RA synovial tissue .
CONCLUSION : Biological activity of TNF-alpha:__entity__ in SF from RA and OA subjects is capable of inducing p65/p50:__entity__ NF-kappaB:__entity__ DNA binding activity in macrophages .
A property of SF that is independent of TNF-alpha:__entity__ and other cytokines:__entity__ is responsible for the induction of a novel slowly migrating NF-kappaB-binding:__entity__ complex:__entity__ .
Soluble mediators in SF of subjects with RA and OA can therefore modulate binding of nuclear:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ to the NF-kappaB:__entity__ binding:__entity__ site:__entity__ in macrophages and may play a role in inflammatory gene expression in arthritis .
Peroxisome:__entity__ proliferator:__entity__ activator:__entity__ receptor-gamma:__entity__ agonists and 15-deoxy-Delta ( 12 , 14 ) ( 12 , 14 ) -PGJ ( 2 ) induce apoptosis in normal and malignant B-lineage cells .
The research described herein evaluates the expression and functional significance of peroxisome:__entity__ proliferator:__entity__ activator:__entity__ receptor-gamma:__entity__ (:__entity__ PPAR-gamma:__entity__ ):__entity__ on B-lineage cells .
Normal mouse B cells and a variety of B lymphoma cells reflective of stages of B cell differentiation ( e.g. , 70Z/3 , CH31 , WEHI-231 , CH12 , and J558 ) express PPAR-gamma:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ and , by Western blot analysis , the 67-kDa:__entity__ PPAR-gamma:__entity__ protein:__entity__ .
15-Deoxy-Delta ( 12 , 14 ) -PGJ ( 2 ) ( 15d-PGJ ( 2 ) ) , a PPAR-gamma agonist , has a dose-dependent antiproliferative and cytotoxic effect on normal and malignant B cells as shown by [ ( 3 ) H ] thymidine and 3- [ 4 , 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl ] -2 , 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays .
Only PPAR-gamma agonists ( thiazolidinediones ) , and not PPAR-alpha agonists , mimicked the effect of 15d-PGJ ( 2 ) on B-lineage cells , indicating that the mechanism by which 15d-PGJ ( 2 ) negatively affects B-lineage cells involves in part PPAR-gamma:__entity__ .
The mechanism by which PPAR-gamma agonists induce cytotoxicity is via apoptosis , as shown by annexin V staining and as confirmed by DNA fragmentation detected using the TUNEL assay .
Interestingly , addition of PGF ( 2alpha ) , which was not known to affect lymphocytes , dramatically attenuated the deleterious effects of PPAR-gamma agonists on B lymphomas .
Surprisingly , 15d-PGJ ( 2 ) induced a massive increase in nuclear mitogen-activated protein kinase activation , and pretreatment with PGF ( 2alpha ) blunted the mitogen-activated protein kinase activation .
This is the first study evaluating PPAR-gamma expression and its significance on B lymphocytes .
PPAR-gamma agonists may serve as a counterbalance to the stimulating effects of other PGs , namely PGE ( 2 ) , which promotes B cell differentiation .
Finally , the use of PGs , such as 15d-PGJ ( 2 ) , and synthetic PPAR-gamma agonists to induce apoptosis in B-lineage cells may lead to the development of novel therapies for fatal B lymphomas
Inhibition of STAT3 signaling leads to apoptosis of leukemic large granular lymphocytes and decreased Mcl-1 expression .
Large granular lymphocyte ( LGL ) leukemia is characterized by the expansion of antigen-activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes .
These leukemic cells are resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis despite expressing high levels of Fas:__entity__ .
We found that leukemic LGL from 19 patients displayed high levels of activated:__entity__ STAT3:__entity__ .
Treatment of leukemic LGL with the JAK-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG-490 induced apoptosis with a corresponding decrease in STAT:__entity__ -DNA binding activity .
Moreover , using an antisense oligonucleotide approach to diminish STAT3 expression , we found that Fas sensitivity was restored in leukemic LGL .
AG-490-induced apoptosis in leukemic LGL was independent of Bcl-xL or Bcl-2 expression .
However , we found that the Bcl-2-family:__entity__ protein:__entity__ Mcl-1:__entity__ was significantly reduced by AG-490 treatment .
Activated:__entity__ STAT3:__entity__ was shown to bind an SIE-related:__entity__ element:__entity__ in the murine:__entity__ mcl-1:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ .
Using a luciferase reporter assay , we demonstrated that v-src overexpression in NIH3T3 induced STAT3:__entity__ -dependent transcriptional activity from the mcl-1:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ and increased endogenous Mcl-1 protein levels .
We conclude that STAT3:__entity__ activation contributed to accumulation of the leukemic LGL clones .
These findings suggest that investigation should focus on novel strategies targeting STAT3:__entity__ in the treatment of LGL leukemia .
Decreased immediate inflammatory:__entity__ gene:__entity__ induction in activating:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factor-2:__entity__ mutant mice .
Transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ activating:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ (:__entity__ ATF:__entity__ ):__entity__ -2:__entity__ is activated by inflammatory signals transduced by the JNK and p38 MAP kinase pathways .
To better define the role of ATF-2:__entity__ in inflammation , adult mice expressing small amounts of a mutant:__entity__ ATF-2:__entity__ protein:__entity__ were challenged with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , anti-CD3:__entity__ antibody:__entity__ or virus .
Within 3 h of challenge by LPS , ATF-2 mutant mice had decreased induction of the adhesion:__entity__ molecules:__entity__ E-selectin:__entity__ , P-selectin:__entity__ and VCAM-1:__entity__ as well as the cytokines:__entity__ tumor:__entity__ necrosis:__entity__ factor-alpha:__entity__ , IL-1beta:__entity__ and IL-6:__entity__ compared with control mice .
Stimulation of T lymphocytes by anti-CD3:__entity__ antibody:__entity__ also showed less induction of IL-1:__entity__ and IL-6:__entity__ in ATF-2 mutant tissues .
ATF-2 mutant thymocytes treated with anti-CD3:__entity__ antibody:__entity__ in vitro demonstrated reduced induction of c-Jun:__entity__ , JunB:__entity__ , JunD:__entity__ and Fra-2:__entity__ .
However , similar to what was observed after p38 kinase inhibition in normal mice , relative ATF-2 deficiency did not prevent the development of a mononuclear cell infiltrate in the week following an inflammatory stimulus .
ATF-2 mutant mice proved more susceptible to death than control mice from LPS plus D-galactosamine injection or Coxsackievirus B3 infection and had a higher incidence of mononuclear pulmonary infiltrates after exposure to Herpes simplex virus-1 .
ATF-2:__entity__ is essential for maximal immediate induction of adhesion:__entity__ molecules:__entity__ and cytokine:__entity__ genes:__entity__ , but at later time points may even protect against overactive immune responses .
LIGHT:__entity__ , a TNF-like:__entity__ molecule:__entity__ , costimulates T cell proliferation and is required for dendritic cell -mediated allogeneic T cell response .
LIGHT:__entity__ is a recently identified member of the TNF:__entity__ superfamily:__entity__ and its receptors , herpesvirus:__entity__ entry:__entity__ mediator:__entity__ and lymphotoxin:__entity__ beta:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ , are found in T cells and stromal cells .
In this study , we demonstrate that LIGHT:__entity__ is selectively expressed on immature dendritic cells ( DCs ) generated from human PBMCs .
In contrast , LIGHT:__entity__ is not detectable in DCs either freshly isolated from PBMCs or rendered mature in vitro by LPS treatment .
Blockade of LIGHT:__entity__ by its soluble:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ , lymphotoxin:__entity__ beta:__entity__ receptor-Ig:__entity__ or HVEM-Ig:__entity__ , inhibits the induction of DC -mediated primary allogeneic T cell response .
Furthermore , engagement of LIGHT:__entity__ costimulates human T cell proliferation , amplifies the NF-kappaB signaling pathway , and preferentially induces the production of IFN-gamma:__entity__ , but not IL-4:__entity__ , in the presence of an antigenic signal .
Our results suggest that LIGHT:__entity__ is a costimulatory:__entity__ molecule:__entity__ involved in DC -mediated cellular immune responses .
Suppression of HIV type 1 replication by a dominant-negative:__entity__ Ets-1:__entity__ mutant:__entity__ .
Activity of the distal:__entity__ region:__entity__ of the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV-1 ) long:__entity__ terminal:__entity__ repeat:__entity__ ( LTR:__entity__ ) , which contains binding:__entity__ sites:__entity__ for the Ets-1:__entity__ and:__entity__ USF-1:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ , is integral for HIV-1 replication .
The Ets-1:__entity__ and:__entity__ USF-1:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ play a critical role in the activity of the HIV-1:__entity__ LTR:__entity__ distal:__entity__ enhancer:__entity__ region:__entity__ , as indicated by the potent dominant negative effect of a mutant:__entity__ Ets-1:__entity__ lacking:__entity__ trans-activation:__entity__ domains:__entity__ on the transcriptional activity of the LTR:__entity__ .
To determine the biological relevance of the Ets-1:__entity__ and:__entity__ USF-1:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ in HIV-1 replication , we examined the effect of expression of the dominant-negative mutant of Ets-1:__entity__ ( dnEts-1:__entity__ ) on HIV-1 infection of T cells .
We demonstrated that expression of dnEts:__entity__ markedly suppressed HIV-1 infection of a T cell line .
This finding indicates that formation of a transcriptionaly:__entity__ active:__entity__ USF-1/Ets-1:__entity__ complex:__entity__ is important in the productive infection of cells by HIV-1 , and suggests that inhibition of the interaction between USF-1:__entity__ and Ets-1:__entity__ with the HIV-1:__entity__ LTR:__entity__ may provide a new target for anti-HIV-1 gene therapy .
Human eosinophils constitutively express nuclear:__entity__ factor:__entity__ of:__entity__ activated:__entity__ T:__entity__ cells:__entity__ p:__entity__ and:__entity__ c:__entity__ .
BACKGROUND : Eosinophils are now known to produce a variety of proinflammatory:__entity__ cytokines:__entity__ , although the molecular factors that regulate their production are poorly understood .
The expression of almost all of the cytokines:__entity__ produced by eosinophils , including the proallergic:__entity__ cytokine:__entity__ IL-4:__entity__ , is now known to be regulated at the level of transcription by members of the nuclear:__entity__ factor:__entity__ of:__entity__ activated:__entity__ T:__entity__ cells:__entity__ ( NFAT:__entity__ ) family of transcription factors .
OBJECTIVE : We sought to characterize the expression of different NFAT:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ in resting and activated eosinophils .
METHODS : Nuclear and whole cell extracts were obtained from both peripheral blood eosinophils and those obtained from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of asthmatic subjects after endobronchial allergen challenge .
NFAT:__entity__ expression was determined by using immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis , DNA-binding assays , and RT-PCR analysis of eosinophil:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ .
RESULTS : Both peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid eosinophils expressed NFATp:__entity__ and:__entity__ NFATc:__entity__ protein:__entity__ .
Unlike activated T cells , which express multiple NFATc isoforms , eosinophils preferentially express the approximately 85-kd isoform .
In addition , eosinophils were found to constitutively express NFATc:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ .
A brief incubation with the T:__entity__ (:__entity__ H:__entity__ ):__entity__ 2:__entity__ cytokines:__entity__ IL-4:__entity__ and IL-5:__entity__ was sufficient to induce the nuclear translocation of NFATc:__entity__ .
Eosinophil nuclear extracts contain multiple factors that can specifically recognize the IL-4:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ P1:__entity__ NFAT:__entity__ site:__entity__ in DNA-binding assays , including NFATp:__entity__ .
CONCLUSION : NFATp:__entity__ and NFATc:__entity__ can regulate the expression of cytokines:__entity__ and other genes in eosinophils but appear to be regulated by a novel signal transduction mechanism in these cells .
BLyS:__entity__ BINDS TO B CELLS WITH HIGH AFFINITY AND INDUCES ACTIVATION OF THE TRANSCRIPTION:__entity__ FACTORS:__entity__ NF-kappaB:__entity__ AND ELF-1:__entity__ .
B:__entity__ lymphocyte:__entity__ stimulator:__entity__ ( BLyS:__entity__ ) is a novel member of the TNF:__entity__ family:__entity__ of:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ expressed by myeloid cells as membrane-bound and soluble forms .
BLyS:__entity__ was shown to act specifically on B cells , inducing proliferation and immunoglobulin production both in vitro and in vivo .
The present study was undertaken to characterize binding of radiolabeled:__entity__ BLyS:__entity__ to its cognate:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ on human B lymphocytes and examine intracellular events initiated by BLyS:__entity__ binding .
Similar to other TNF:__entity__ family:__entity__ members:__entity__ , BLyS:__entity__ is present in solution as a homotrimer:__entity__ as determined by gel filtration chromatography and light scattering analysis .
BLyS:__entity__ binding to B cells is specific as other TNF:__entity__ family:__entity__ members:__entity__ tested did not compete for ( 125 ) I- BLyS:__entity__ binding .
Analysis of equilibrium binding of (:__entity__ 125:__entity__ ):__entity__ I-labeled:__entity__ BLyS:__entity__ to purified human tonsillar B cells demonstrated saturable binding .
Scatchard analysis of the binding data revealed a single class of high-affinity binding on human B cells with approximately 2600 binding sites per cell and an apparent dissociation constant ( K ( D ) ) of about 0.1 nM .
In addition we report that BLyS:__entity__ binding to B cells results in the activation of NF-kappaB:__entity__ and the Ets:__entity__ family:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ , ELF-1:__entity__ , and in the induction of mRNA for Polo-like:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ ( PLK:__entity__ ) .

Design and use of an inducibly activated human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Nef:__entity__ to study immune modulation .
The Nef:__entity__ protein:__entity__ of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) has been shown to enhance the infectivity of virus particles , downmodulate cell:__entity__ surface:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ , and associate with many intracellular:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ that are thought to facilitate HIV infection .
One of the challenges in defining the molecular events regulated by Nef:__entity__ has been obtaining good expression of Nef:__entity__ protein:__entity__ in T cells .
This has been attributed to effects of Nef:__entity__ on cell proliferation and apoptosis .
We have designed a Nef:__entity__ protein:__entity__ that is readily expressed in T-cell lines and whose function is inducibly activated .
It is composed of a fusion between full-length:__entity__ Nef:__entity__ and the estrogen:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ hormone-binding:__entity__ domain:__entity__ ( Nef-ER:__entity__ ) .
The Nef-ER:__entity__ is kept in an inactive state due to steric hindrance , and addition of the membrane-permeable drug 4-hydroxytamoxifen ( 4-HT ) , which binds to the ER:__entity__ domain:__entity__ , leads to inducible activation of Nef-ER:__entity__ within cells .
We demonstrate that Nef-ER:__entity__ inducibly associates with the 62-kDa:__entity__ Ser/Thr:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ and is localized to specific membrane microdomains ( lipid rafts ) only after activation .
Using this inducible Nef:__entity__ , we also compared the specific requirements for CD4:__entity__ and HLA-A2:__entity__ downmodulation in a SupT1 T-cell line .
Half-maximal downmodulation of cell:__entity__ surface:__entity__ CD4:__entity__ required very little active Nef-ER:__entity__ and occurred as early as 4 h after addition of 4-HT .
In contrast , 50 % downmodulation of HLA-A2:__entity__ by Nef:__entity__ required 16 to 24 h and about 50- to 100-fold-greater concentrations of 4-HT .
These data suggest that HLA-A2:__entity__ downmodulation may require certain threshold levels of active Nef:__entity__ .
The differential timing of CD4:__entity__ and HLA-A2:__entity__ downmodulation may have implications for HIV pathogenesis and immune evasion .
Regulation of chemokine mRNA expression in a rat model of vanadium-induced pulmonary inflammation .
Environmental and occupational exposure to vanadium dusts results in toxic effects mainly confined to the respiratory system .
Using a rat model of acute lung inflammation induced by intratracheal instillation of sodium metavanadate ( NaVO3 ) at the dose of 200 microg V/kg , we investigated the relationship between the cytologic characterization of pulmonary inflammation and the expression of chemokine:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ .
Significant polymorphonuclear leukocyte ( PMN ) influx ( P < 0.01 ) into the lung was noted 4 h after NaVO3 instillation , whereas alveolar macrophages ( AMs ) in bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) cells appeared to decrease significantly .
In contrast , neither PMNs nor AMs changed substantially 1 h after NaVO3 instillation .
By Northern analysis , macrophage:__entity__ inflammatory:__entity__ protein:__entity__ (:__entity__ MIP:__entity__ ):__entity__ -2:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ in BAL cells increased markedly 1 h after NaVO3 instillation and reduced a little bit at 4 h , whereas MIP-1alpha:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ in BAL cells was expressed relatively high 1 h after NaVO3 instillation , although a basal expression was detected in control group , and returned rapidly nearly to control level at 4 h .
Since MIP-2:__entity__ is a potent PMN chemoattractant and MIP-1alpha:__entity__ is a potent macrophage/monocyte chemoattractant has been well known .
The facts that PMN influx was preceded by increased MIP-2 mRNA expression , suggesting that MIP-2:__entity__ is involved in the development of NaVO3-induced pulmonary inflammation , whereas increased MIP-1alpha:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ expression was followed by decreased AMs in BAL cells , suggesting AMs might be activated by MIP-1alpha:__entity__ , adherent to the lining surface of the airways and then resistant to be washed out .
To delineate the mechanisms of transcriptional activation , we recently cloned the 5'-flanking:__entity__ region:__entity__ of the MIP-2:__entity__ gene:__entity__ .
The promotor:__entity__ region:__entity__ contains consensus:__entity__ binding:__entity__ sites:__entity__ for transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ nuclear:__entity__ factor:__entity__ kappaB:__entity__ ( NF-kappaB:__entity__ ) and activator:__entity__ protein-1:__entity__ ( AP-1:__entity__ ) .
Using electrophoretic mobility shift assay , increased nuclear NF-kappaB:__entity__ , not AP-1:__entity__ , binding activity was detected 1 h after NaVO3 instillation , which correlated with the induction of MIP-2:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ .
p65:__entity__ (:__entity__ Rel:__entity__ A:__entity__ ):__entity__ and p50:__entity__ protein:__entity__ appears to be involved in MIP-2 NF-kappaB:__entity__ binding .
Taken together , our studies suggest that MIP-2:__entity__ is an important mediator of NaVO3-induced pulmonary inflammation in the rat model .
In addition , elevated MIP-2:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ levels are accompanied by increased NF-kappaB:__entity__ binding activity in BAL cells , suggesting possible MIP-2:__entity__ transcriptional regulation through NF-kappaB:__entity__ .
Activation of signal transduction and apoptosis in healthy lymphomonocytes exposed to bystander HIV-1-infected cells .
Persistent activation of the immune system is one of the hallmarks of HIV-1 infection .
In this study we analysed the induction of factors involved in cytokine signal transduction , such as STAT:__entity__ 1:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ and IRF-1:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ , in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) exposed to HIV-infected cells , and the induction of apoptosis .
Western blot analyses and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction results indicate that both cells infected with a X4 strain and cells infected with a R5 strain are able to increase intracellular levels of STAT:__entity__ 1alpha:__entity__ and:__entity__ beta:__entity__ proteins as well as IRF-1:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ .
This effect was prevented by neutralizing antibodies against interferon-alpha:__entity__ ( IFN-alpha:__entity__ ) .
HIV-1-infected cells dose-dependently induced apoptotic commitment in normal PBMC , as revealed by DNA fragmentation analysis , but this was not accompanied by an increase of caspase-3 activity , even if a slight up-regulation of IL-1beta-converting:__entity__ enzyme:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ was detected .
Apoptosis induction could be abrogated mainly by antibodies:__entity__ against tumour:__entity__ necrosis:__entity__ factor-alpha:__entity__ ( TNF-alpha:__entity__ ) and , to a lesser extent , by antibodies:__entity__ against IFN-gamma:__entity__ .
All these findings suggest that uninfected PBMC can undergo activation of signal transduction and apoptosis after exposure to bystander HIV-infected cells , subsequent to the induction of cytokines:__entity__ such as IFNs:__entity__ and TNF-alpha:__entity__ .
The physical association of protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ C:__entity__ theta:__entity__ with a lipid raft-associated inhibitor of kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ factor:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ (:__entity__ IKK:__entity__ ):__entity__ complex:__entity__ plays a role in the activation of the NF-kappa B cascade by TCR:__entity__ and CD28:__entity__ .
We investigated the role of protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ C:__entity__ theta:__entity__ ( PKCtheta:__entity__ ) in the activation of the NF-kappaB:__entity__ cascade in primary human CD4 ( + ) lymphocytes .
Among six or so PKC:__entity__ isoforms:__entity__ expressed in T cells , only PKCtheta:__entity__ participates in the assembly of the supramolecular activation clusters at the contact site of the TCR:__entity__ with Ag:__entity__ .
Signaling via both the TCR:__entity__ and CD28:__entity__ is required for optimal activation of the multisubunit:__entity__ IkappaB:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ (:__entity__ IKK:__entity__ ):__entity__ complex:__entity__ in primary human T lymphocytes ; this activation could be inhibited by a Ca ( 2+ ) -independent PKC isoform inhibitor , rottlerin .
Moreover , endogenous PKCtheta:__entity__ physically associates with activated IKK:__entity__ complexes:__entity__ in CD3/CD28-costimulated primary CD4 ( + ) T cells .
The same set of stimuli also induced relocation of endogenous PKCtheta:__entity__ and IKKs:__entity__ to a GM1 ganglioside-enriched , detergent-insoluble membrane compartment in primary T cells .
IKKs:__entity__ recruited to these lipid rafts were capable of phosphorylating a recombinant IkappaBalpha sustrate .
Confocal microscopy further demonstrated that exogenously expressed PKCtheta:__entity__ and IKKss:__entity__ colocalize in the membrane of CD3/CD28-costimulated Jurkat T cells .
Constitutively active but not kinase-inactive:__entity__ PKCtheta:__entity__ activated IKKbeta:__entity__ in Jurkat T cells .
Expression of dominant-active:__entity__ PKCtheta:__entity__ also had stimulatory effects on the CD28:__entity__ response:__entity__ element:__entity__ of the IL-2:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ .
Taken together , these data show that the activation of PKCtheta:__entity__ by the TCR:__entity__ and CD28:__entity__ plays an important role in the assembly and activation of IKK:__entity__ complexes:__entity__ in the T cell membrane
T-cell -mediated regulation of osteoclastogenesis by signalling cross-talk between RANKL:__entity__ and IFN-gamma:__entity__ .
Bone resorption is regulated by the immune system , where T-cell expression of RANKL:__entity__ ( receptor:__entity__ activator:__entity__ of:__entity__ nuclear:__entity__ factor:__entity__ (:__entity__ NF:__entity__ ):__entity__ -kappaB:__entity__ ligand:__entity__ ) , a member of the tumour-necrosis:__entity__ factor:__entity__ family:__entity__ that is essential for osteoclastogenesis , may contribute to pathological conditions , such as autoimmune arthritis .
However , whether activated T cells maintain bone homeostasis by counterbalancing the action of RANKL:__entity__ remains unknown .
Here we show that T-cell production of interferon:__entity__ (:__entity__ IFN:__entity__ ):__entity__ -gamma:__entity__ strongly suppresses osteoclastogenesis by interfering with the RANKL:__entity__ -RANK signalling pathway .
IFN-gamma:__entity__ induces rapid degradation of the RANK:__entity__ adapter:__entity__ protein:__entity__ , TRAF6:__entity__ ( tumour:__entity__ necrosis:__entity__ factor:__entity__ receptor-associated:__entity__ factor:__entity__ 6:__entity__ ) , which results in strong inhibition of the RANKL:__entity__ -induced activation of the transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ NF-kappaB:__entity__ and JNK:__entity__ .
This inhibition of osteoclastogenesis is rescued by overexpressing TRAF6:__entity__ in precursor cells , which indicates that TRAF6:__entity__ is the target critical for the IFN-gamma:__entity__ action .
Furthermore , we provide evidence that the accelerated degradation of TRAF6:__entity__ requires both its ubiquitination , which is initiated by RANKL:__entity__ , and IFN-gamma:__entity__ -induced activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system .
Our study shows that there is cross-talk between the tumour:__entity__ necrosis:__entity__ factor:__entity__ and IFN:__entity__ families:__entity__ of cytokines:__entity__ , through which IFN-gamma:__entity__ provides a negative link between T-cell activation and bone resorption .
Our results may offer a therapeutic approach to treat the inflammation-induced tissue breakdown .
Stromal-derived:__entity__ factor:__entity__ 1:__entity__ and thrombopoietin:__entity__ regulate distinct aspects of human megakaryopoiesis .
The role of the chemokine:__entity__ binding stromal-derived:__entity__ factor:__entity__ 1:__entity__ ( SDF-1:__entity__ ) in normal human megakaryopoiesis at the cellular and molecular levels and its comparison with that of thrombopoietin:__entity__ ( TPO:__entity__ ) have not been determined .
In this study it was found that SDF-1:__entity__ , unlike TPO:__entity__ , does not stimulate alpha ( IIb ) beta ( 3 ) ( + ) cell proliferation or differentiation or have an antiapoptotic effect .
However , it does induce chemotaxis , trans-Matrigel migration , and secretion of matrix metalloproteinase:__entity__ 9:__entity__ ( MMP-9:__entity__ ) and vascular:__entity__ endothelial:__entity__ growth:__entity__ factor:__entity__ ( VEGF:__entity__ ) by these cells , and both SDF-1:__entity__ and TPO:__entity__ increase the adhesion of alpha ( IIb ) beta ( 3 ) ( + ) cells to fibrinogen:__entity__ and vitronectin:__entity__ .
Investigating the intracellular signaling pathways induced by SDF-1:__entity__ and TPO:__entity__ revealed some overlapping patterns of protein phosphorylation/activation ( mitogen-activated:__entity__ protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ [:__entity__ MAPK:__entity__ ]:__entity__ p42/44:__entity__ , MAPK:__entity__ p38:__entity__ , and AKT:__entity__ [:__entity__ protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ B:__entity__ ]:__entity__ ) and some that were distinct for TPO:__entity__ ( eg , JAK-STAT:__entity__ ) and for SDF-1:__entity__ ( eg , NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ ) .
It was also found that though inhibition of phosphatidyl-inositol:__entity__ 3-kinase:__entity__ ( PI-3K:__entity__ ) by LY294002 in alpha ( IIb ) beta ( 3 ) ( + ) cells induced apoptosis and inhibited chemotaxis adhesion and the secretion of MMP-9:__entity__ and VEGF:__entity__ , the inhibition of MAPK:__entity__ p42/44:__entity__ ( by the MEK inhibitor U0126 ) had no effect on the survival , proliferation , and migration of these cells .
Hence , it is suggested that the proliferative effect of TPO:__entity__ is more related to activation of the JAK-STAT pathway ( unique to TPO:__entity__ ) , and the PI-3K-AKT axis is differentially involved in TPO- and SDF-1-dependent signaling .
Accordingly , PI-3K:__entity__ is involved in TPO:__entity__ -mediated inhibition of apoptosis , TPO- and SDF-1-regulated adhesion to fibrinogen:__entity__ and vitronectin:__entity__ , and SDF-1:__entity__ -mediated migration .
This study expands the understanding of the role of SDF-1:__entity__ and TPO:__entity__ in normal human megakaryopoiesis and indicates the molecular basis of the observed differences in cellular responses .

Adhesion of immature and mature T cells induces in human thymic epithelial cells ( TEC ) activation of IL-6:__entity__ gene:__entity__ trascription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ ( NF-kappaB:__entity__ and NF-IL6:__entity__ ) and IL-6 gene expression : role of alpha3beta1:__entity__ and:__entity__ alpha6beta4:__entity__ integrins:__entity__ .
T cell precursors homed to thymus develop in close contact with stromal cells .
Among them , thymic epithelial cells ( TEC ) are known to exert dominant roles in their survival and functional shaping .
Key molecules mediating TEC / thymocytes interactions include cytokines:__entity__ and growth:__entity__ factors:__entity__ secreted by the two cell types and adhesion:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ mediating cell contact .
Signaling events triggered in thymocytes by adhesion to epithelial cells have been extensively investigated , whereas little is known on the opposite phenomenon .
We have previously investigated this issue in a co-culture system composed of TEC cultures derived from human normal thymus and heterologous thymocytes .
We demonstrated that thymocytes adhere to TEC involving beta1:__entity__ and:__entity__ beta4:__entity__ integrins:__entity__ and induce the clustering of alpha3beta1:__entity__ and:__entity__ alpha6beta4:__entity__ heterodimers:__entity__ at the TEC surface .
In addition thymocyte adhesion was followed by activation of NF-kappaB:__entity__ and NF-IL6:__entity__ gene:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ and enhanced IL-6 production .
The two latter phenomena were reproduced by the cross-linking of the alpha3:__entity__ , alpha6:__entity__ , beta1:__entity__ and:__entity__ beta4:__entity__ integrins:__entity__ , thus implying that the alpha3beta1:__entity__ and:__entity__ alpha6beta4:__entity__ heterodimers:__entity__ can signal during thymocyte adhesion .
We have extended our previous work investigating in the same experimental setting the inducing activity of non stimulated or activated policlonal or clonal mature T cells as representative of the more mature thymocyte subset .
We found that adhesion of unstimulated T cell i ) involved beta1 , but not beta4 integrin functions at the surface ii ) induced the clustering of alpha3beta1:__entity__ , but not alpha2beta1:__entity__ heterodimers:__entity__ at the TEC surface and iii ) up-regulated the nuclear binding activity of NF-kappaB:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ and the IL-6 secretion .
We propose that alpha3beta1:__entity__ and:__entity__ alpha6beta4:__entity__ heterodimers:__entity__ are induced to cluster at the TEC surface recognizing yet unknown cellular:__entity__ ligands:__entity__ differentially expressed during T cell development .
Identification and characterization of SKAT-2:__entity__ , a novel Th2-specific:__entity__ zinc:__entity__ finger:__entity__ gene:__entity__ .
We have identified a novel Kruppel-type:__entity__ zinc:__entity__ finger:__entity__ (:__entity__ ZF:__entity__ ):__entity__ gene:__entity__ , SKAT-2:__entity__ , which is selectively expressed by murine Th2 cells .
The protein encoded by this gene has 14 C2H2-type ZF tandemly arrayed at its C:__entity__ terminus:__entity__ and N-terminal:__entity__ SCAN:__entity__ box:__entity__ and KRAB:__entity__ domains:__entity__ .
SKAT-2:__entity__ is tissue restricted in expression at the RNA level , detectable only in brain and at low levels in kidney and spleen and few hematopoietic cell lines .
By in situ hybridization , SKAT-2:__entity__ expression was found to peak in antigen-stimulated CD4 ( + ) T cells after 2-3 days of culture under Th2 but not Th1 biasing conditions .
This pattern of expression closely mirrored that of GATA-3:__entity__ in the same cells .
In transient transfection experiments in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin-stimulated EL4 cells , SKAT-2:__entity__ was found to up-regulate the activity of the IL-4:__entity__ but:__entity__ not:__entity__ the:__entity__ IL-5:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ , contrasting with the ability of GATA-3:__entity__ to activate both promoters:__entity__ .
This result was confirmed using clones of EL4 cells stably expressing an inducible form of SKAT-2:__entity__ , thus SKAT-2:__entity__ is a novel Th2-specific:__entity__ gene:__entity__ that may play a role in selective regulation of cytokine:__entity__ genes:__entity__ in T cells .
hsp70:__entity__ interacting:__entity__ protein:__entity__ Hip:__entity__ does not affect glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ folding by the hsp90-based chaperone machinery except to oppose the effect of BAG-1:__entity__ .
Reticulocyte lysate contains a chaperone system that assembles glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ (:__entity__ GR:__entity__ ):__entity__ .hsp90:__entity__ heterocomplexes:__entity__ .
Using purified:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ , we have prepared a five-protein heterocomplex assembly system consisting of two proteins essential for heterocomplex assembly- hsp90:__entity__ and hsp70:__entity__ -and three proteins that act as co-chaperones to enhance assembly- Hop:__entity__ , hsp40:__entity__ , p23:__entity__ [ Morishima , Y. , Kanelakis , K. C. , Silverstein , A. M. , Dittmar , K. D. , Estrada , L. , and Pratt , W. B. ( 2000 ) J. Biol. Chem. 275 , 6894-6900 ] .
The hsp70:__entity__ co-chaperone:__entity__ Hip:__entity__ has been recovered in receptor.hsp90:__entity__ heterocomplexes:__entity__ at an intermediate stage of assembly in reticulocyte lysate , and Hip:__entity__ is also thought to be an intrinsic component of the assembly machinery .
Here we show that immunodepletion of Hip:__entity__ from reticulocyte lysate or addition of high levels of Hip:__entity__ to the purified five-protein system does not affect GR.hsp90 heterocomplex assembly or the activation of steroid binding activity that occurs with assembly .
Despite the fact that Hip:__entity__ does not affect assembly , it is recovered in GR.hsp90:__entity__ heterocomplexes:__entity__ assembled by both systems .
In the five-protein system , Hip:__entity__ prevents inhibition of assembly by the hsp70:__entity__ co-chaperone:__entity__ BAG-1:__entity__ , and cotransfection of Hip:__entity__ with BAG-1:__entity__ opposes BAG-1:__entity__ reduction of steroid binding activity in COS cells .
We conclude that Hip:__entity__ is not a component of the assembly machinery but that it could play a regulatory role in opposition to BAG-1:__entity__ .
Cutting edge : STAT6-deficient mice have enhanced tumor immunity to primary and metastatic mammary carcinoma .
STAT4:__entity__ and STAT6:__entity__ are essential for the development of CD4 ( + ) Th1 and Th2 development , respectively .
Tumor immunologists have hypothesized that Th1 cells are critical in tumor immunity because they facilitate differentiation of CD8 ( + ) T cells , which are potent anti-tumor effectors .
We have used STAT4 ( -/- ) and STAT6 ( -/- ) mice to test this hypothesis .
BALB/c and knockout mice were challenged in the mammary gland with the highly malignant and spontaneously metastatic BALB/c-derived 4T1 mammary carcinoma .
Primary tumor growth and metastatic disease are reduced in STAT6 ( -/- ) mice relative to BALB/c and STAT4 ( -/- ) mice .
Ab depletions demonstrate that the effect is mediated by CD8 ( + ) T cells , and immunized STAT6 ( -/- ) mice have higher levels of 4T1-specific CTL than BALB/c or STAT4 ( -/- ) mice .
Surprisingly , Th1 or Th2 cells are not involved , because CD4 depletion does not diminish the anti-tumor effect .
Therefore , deletion of the STAT6:__entity__ gene:__entity__ facilitates development of potent anti-tumor immunity via a CD4 ( + ) -independent pathway .
Activation of oncogenic:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ AP-1:__entity__ in T cells infected with human T cell leukemia virus type 1 .
Human T cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) Tax:__entity__ protein:__entity__ transforms primary human T cells in vitro .
We previously showed that Tax:__entity__ induces the expression of various family members of the transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ AP-1:__entity__ such as c-Jun:__entity__ , JunD:__entity__ , c-Fos:__entity__ , and Fra-1:__entity__ at the mRNA level in T cells .
In this study , we have examined the ability of Tax:__entity__ to activate transcription through the AP-1-binding:__entity__ site:__entity__ ( AP-1:__entity__ site:__entity__ ) .
A transient transfection study showed that Tax:__entity__ can activate transcription through the AP-1-binding:__entity__ site:__entity__ in a human T cell line , whereas any combination of AP-1:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ did so much less than Tax:__entity__ , indicating that the activation of the AP-1:__entity__ site:__entity__ by Tax:__entity__ may require a mechanism other than the induction of AP-1:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ .
Fresh peripheral blood leukemia cells of all surveyed ATL patients displayed constitutive AP-1 DNA-binding activity , whereas no normal individuals did .
However , the HTLV-1:__entity__ genes:__entity__ , including tax:__entity__ , are not significantly expressed in fresh leukemia cells from ATL patients .
Our present results suggest that activation of AP-1:__entity__ occurs through Tax-dependent and -independent mechanisms in HTLV-1-infected T cells , which may play some roles in dysregulated phenotypes of HTLV-1-infected cells .
2 , 2 ' , 4 , 6 , 6'-pentachlorobiphenyl induces apoptosis in human monocytic cells .
Polychlorinatedbiphenyls ( PCBs ) are a group of persistent and widely dispersed environmental pollutants , some of which may be immunotoxic .
In the present study , we investigated the effect of PCBs on immune system by assessing apoptotic cell death in human monocytic U937 cells .
Among the various congeners tested , 2 , 2 ' , 4 , 6 , 6'-pentachlorobiphenyl ( PeCB ) , a highly ortho-substituted congener , specifically induced DNA fragmentation , a hallmark of apoptosis , while the other examined di- , tri- , tetra- , and pentachlorobiphenyls did not .
To further study the 2 , 2 ' , 4 , 6 , 6'-PeCB-induced cell death , various features of apoptosis were examined .
2 , 2 ' , 4 , 6 , 6'-PeCB caused a decrease in cell viability and induced cellular morphologic features characteristic of apoptosis such as chromatin aggregation and apoptotic bodies .
In addition , caspase-3:__entity__ , an executioner of apoptosis , was activated and its substrate , poly:__entity__ (:__entity__ ADP-ribose:__entity__ ):__entity__ polymerase:__entity__ ( PARP:__entity__ ) , was cleaved during 2 , 2 ' , 4 , 6 , 6'-PeCB-induced apoptosis .
In contrast , 3 , 3 ' , 4 , 4 ' , 5-PeCB , a congener of coplanar structure , as well as 2 , 3 , 7 , 8-TCDD did not induce apoptosis in these human monocytic cells , although they potently induced CYP:__entity__ 1A1:__entity__ in human hepatoma Hep G2 cells .
Taken together , the data indicate that 2 , 2 ' , 4 , 6 , 6'-PeCB induces apoptosis in human monocytic cells through a mechanism that is independent of the arylhydrocarbon:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ .
This suggests a possibly separate mechanism by which PCBs cause immunosuppression .
Effects of deregulated Raf activation on integrin:__entity__ , cytokine-receptor expression and the induction of apoptosis in hematopoietic cells .
The effects of deregulated Raf activation on the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic cells were investigated .
The cytokine-dependent murine myeloid FDC-P1 and human erythroleukemic TF-1 cell lines were transformed to grow in response to deregulated Raf expression in the absence of exogenous:__entity__ cytokines:__entity__ .
The conditionally active Raf:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ were regulated by beta-estradiol as cDNAs:__entity__ containing the Raf:__entity__ catalytic:__entity__ , but lacking negative-regulatory:__entity__ domains:__entity__ , were ligated to the hormone:__entity__ binding:__entity__ domain:__entity__ of the estrogen:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ ( deltaRaf:__entity__ ::__entity__ ER:__entity__ ) .
Continuous deltaRaf:__entity__ expression prevented apoptosis in the absence of exogenous:__entity__ cytokines:__entity__ and altered the morphology of the FD/deltaRaf : ER cells as they grew in large aggregated masses ( > 100 cells ) whereas the parental cytokine-dependent FDC-P1 cells grew in smaller grape-like clusters ( < 10 cells ) .
FD/deltaRaf-1 : ER cells growing in response to Raf activation displayed decreased levels of the Mac-2:__entity__ and:__entity__ Mac-3:__entity__ molecules:__entity__ on their cell surface .
In contrast , when these cells were cultured in IL-3:__entity__ , higher levels of these adhesion:__entity__ molecules:__entity__ were detected .
Expression of activated Raf:__entity__ oncoproteins:__entity__ also abrogated cytokine dependency and prevented apoptosis of TF-1 cells .
Moreover , the differentiation status of these Raf-responsive cells was more immature upon Raf activation as culture with the differentiation-inducing agent phorbol 12 myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) and beta-estradiol resulted in decreased levels of the CD11b:__entity__ and:__entity__ CD18:__entity__ integrin:__entity__ molecules:__entity__ on the cell surface .
In contrast when the Raf-responsive cells were induced to differentiate with PMA and GM-CSF:__entity__ , in the absence of deltaRaf:__entity__ ::__entity__ ER:__entity__ activation , increased levels of the CD11b:__entity__ and:__entity__ CD18:__entity__ molecules:__entity__ were detected .
Retinoic acid ( RA ) inhibited 3H-thymidine incorporation in response to GM-CSF:__entity__ .
Interestingly , Raf activation counterbalanced the inhibition of DNA synthesis caused by RA but not PMA .
Thus deregulated Raf expression can alter cytokine dependency , integrin expression and the stage of differentiation .
These Raf-responsive cell lines will be useful in elucidating the roles of the MAP kinase cascade on hematopoietic cell differentiation and malignant transformation
Cyclic AMP activates p38:__entity__ mitogen-activated:__entity__ protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ in Th2 cells : phosphorylation of GATA-3:__entity__ and stimulation of Th2 cytokine gene expression .
cAMP is an important second messenger with immunomodulatory properties .
Elevation of intracellular cAMP in T cells , induced by agents such as IL-1alpha:__entity__ or PGs:__entity__ , inhibits T cell activation .
In effector T cells , an increase in the level of intracellular cAMP inhibits cytokine:__entity__ production in Th1 cells but stimulates cytokine:__entity__ production in Th2 cells .
Here we report that cAMP-induced effects in Th2 cells occur independently of the protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ A:__entity__ pathway , which is the major mediator of cAMP-induced signaling events in most cell types .
Instead , cAMP stimulates activation of p38:__entity__ mitogen-activated:__entity__ protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ in Th2 cells .
This appears to be a Th2 -selective event because cAMP barely increased p38:__entity__ phosphorylation in Th1 cells .
We show that in Th2 cells , cAMP promotes the production of both IL-5:__entity__ and IL-13:__entity__ , which play distinct but critical roles in asthma pathogenesis .
Our data also show that cAMP causes increased phosphorylation of the transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ GATA-3:__entity__ , which we have shown is a critical regulator of Th2 cytokine gene expression and , in turn , of airway inflammation in mice .
Thus , Th2 -specific GATA-3:__entity__ expression and p38:__entity__ mitogen-activated:__entity__ protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ activation together provide a molecular basis for the differential effects of cAMP in the two T helper cell subsets .
Characterization of IL-4:__entity__ and IL-13:__entity__ signals dependent on the human:__entity__ IL-13:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ chain:__entity__ 1:__entity__ : redundancy of requirement of tyrosine residue for STAT3 activation .
IL-4:__entity__ and IL-13:__entity__ are pleiotropic:__entity__ cytokines:__entity__ whose biological activities overlap with each other .
IL-13:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ chain:__entity__ 1:__entity__ ( IL-13R:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ 1:__entity__ ) is necessary for binding to IL-13:__entity__ , and the heterodimer composed of IL-13R:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ 1:__entity__ and IL-4R:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ chain:__entity__ transduces IL-13:__entity__ and IL-4:__entity__ signals ; however , the functional mapping of the intracellular:__entity__ domain:__entity__ of IL-13R:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ 1:__entity__ is not fully understood .
In this study , we constructed wild and mutated types of human:__entity__ IL-13R:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ 1:__entity__ , and analyzed IL-4:__entity__ and IL-13:__entity__ signals using an IL-13R:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ 1:__entity__ -transfected human B cell line .
Expression of IL-13R:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ 1:__entity__ evoked STAT3:__entity__ activation by IL-4:__entity__ and IL-13:__entity__ , and in stimulated human B cells , on which IL-13R:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ 1:__entity__ was highly expressed , IL-4:__entity__ and IL-13:__entity__ induced STAT3:__entity__ activation .
Replacement of the two tyrosine residues completely abolished STAT3:__entity__ activation , although replacing either tyrosine residue alone retained it .
Furthermore , we found that the Box1:__entity__ region:__entity__ and the C-terminal:__entity__ tail:__entity__ of IL-13R:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ 1:__entity__ were critical for binding to Tyk2:__entity__ , and activation of Jak1:__entity__ , Tyk2:__entity__ , the insulin:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ substrate-1:__entity__ and STAT6:__entity__ respectively .
These results suggest that STAT3:__entity__ activation is involved with IL-4:__entity__ and IL-13:__entity__ signals in human B cells along with the activation of STAT6:__entity__ , and that there is a unique sequence in IL-13R:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ 1:__entity__ to activate STAT3:__entity__ .
Functional uncoupling of the Janus kinase 3-Stat5 pathway in malignant growth of human T cell leukemia virus type 1-transformed human T cells .
Human T cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) transforms cytokine:__entity__ -dependent T lymphocytes and causes adult T cell leukemia .
Janus:__entity__ tyrosine:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ (:__entity__ Jak:__entity__ ):__entity__ 3:__entity__ and transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ Stat5a:__entity__ and Stat5b:__entity__ are essential for the proliferation of normal T cells and are constitutively hyperactivated in both HTLV-1-transformed human T cell lines and lymphocytes isolated from HTLV-1-infected patients ; therefore , a critical role for the Jak3-Stat5 pathway in the progression of this disease has been postulated .
We recently reported that tyrphostin AG-490 selectively blocked IL-2 activation of Jak3/Stat5:__entity__ and growth of murine T cell lines .
Here we demonstrate that disruption of Jak3/Stat5a/b signaling with AG-490 ( 50 & mgr ; M ) blocked the proliferation of primary human T lymphocytes , but paradoxically failed to inhibit the proliferation of HTLV-1-transformed human T cell lines , HuT-102 and MT-2 .
Structural homologues of AG-490 also inhibited the proliferation of primary human T cells , but not HTLV-1-infected cells .
Disruption of constitutive Jak3/Stat5 activation by AG-490 was demonstrated by inhibition of 1 ) tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak3:__entity__ , Stat5a:__entity__ ( Tyr ( 694 ) ) , and Stat5b:__entity__ ( Tyr ( 699 ) ) ; 2 ) serine phosphorylation of Stat5a:__entity__ ( Ser ( 726 ) ) as determined by a novel phosphospecific:__entity__ Ab:__entity__ ; and 3 ) Stat5a/b DNA binding to the Stat5-responsive:__entity__ beta-casein:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ .
In contrast , AG-490 had no effect on DNA binding by p50/p65:__entity__ components:__entity__ of NF-kappaB:__entity__ , a transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ activated by the HTLV-1-encoded:__entity__ phosphoprotein:__entity__ ,:__entity__ Tax:__entity__ .
Collectively , these data suggest that the Jak3-Stat5 pathway in HTLV-1-transformed T cells has become functionally redundant for proliferation .
Reversal of this functional uncoupling may be required before Jak3/Stat5 inhibitors will be useful in the treatment of this malignancy .
The Epstein-Barr:__entity__ virus:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ initiating B-cell transformation is activated by RFX:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ and the B-cell-specific:__entity__ activator:__entity__ protein:__entity__ BSAP/Pax5:__entity__ .
Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) -induced B-cell growth transformation , a central feature of the virus ' strategy for colonizing the human B-cell system , requires full virus latent gene expression and is initiated by transcription from the viral:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ Wp:__entity__ .
Interestingly , when EBV accesses other cell types , this growth-transforming program is not activated .
The present work focuses on a region of Wp:__entity__ which in reporter assays confers B-cell -specific activity .
Bandshift studies indicate that this region contains three factor binding sites , termed sites:__entity__ B:__entity__ ,:__entity__ C:__entity__ ,:__entity__ and:__entity__ D:__entity__ , in addition to a previously characterized CREB:__entity__ site:__entity__ .
Here we show that site:__entity__ C:__entity__ binds members of the ubiquitously expressed RFX:__entity__ family:__entity__ of:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ , notably RFX1:__entity__ , RFX3:__entity__ , and the associated factor MIBP1:__entity__ , whereas sites:__entity__ B:__entity__ and:__entity__ D:__entity__ both bind the B-cell-specific:__entity__ activator:__entity__ protein:__entity__ BSAP/Pax5:__entity__ .
In reporter assays with mutant:__entity__ Wp:__entity__ constructs:__entity__ , the loss of factor binding to any one of these sites severely impaired promoter activity in B cells , while the wild-type:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ could be activated in non-B cells by ectopic BSAP expression .
We suggest that Wp:__entity__ regulation by BSAP:__entity__ helps to ensure the B-cell specificity of EBV 's growth-transforming function .
Activation of the Lck:__entity__ tyrosine:__entity__ protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ by the Herpesvirus saimiri tip:__entity__ protein:__entity__ involves two binding interactions .
The Tip:__entity__ protein:__entity__ of Herpesvirus saimiri strain 484C binds to and activates the Lck:__entity__ tyrosine:__entity__ protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ .
Two sequences in the Tip:__entity__ protein:__entity__ were previously shown to be involved in binding to Lck:__entity__ .
A proline-rich:__entity__ region:__entity__ , residues 132-141 , binds to the SH3:__entity__ domain:__entity__ of the Lck:__entity__ protein:__entity__ .
We show here that the other Lck-binding:__entity__ domain:__entity__ , residues 104-113 , binds to the carboxyl-terminal:__entity__ half:__entity__ of Lck:__entity__ and that this binding does not require the Lck:__entity__ SH3:__entity__ domain:__entity__ .
Mutated Tip:__entity__ containing only one functional Lck-binding:__entity__ domain:__entity__ can bind stably to Lck:__entity__ , although not as strongly as wild-type:__entity__ Tip:__entity__ .
Interaction of Tip:__entity__ with Lck:__entity__ through either Lck-binding:__entity__ domain:__entity__ increases the activity of Lck:__entity__ in vivo .
Simultaneous binding of both domains is required for maximal activation of Lck:__entity__ .
The transient expression of Tip:__entity__ in T cells was found to stimulate both Stat3:__entity__ -dependent and NF-AT:__entity__ -dependent transcription .
Mutant forms of Tip:__entity__ lacking one or the other of the two Lck-binding:__entity__ domains:__entity__ retained the ability to stimulate Stat3:__entity__ -dependent transcription .
Tip:__entity__ lacking the proline-rich Lck-binding:__entity__ domain:__entity__ exhibited almost wild-type activity in this assay .
In contrast , ablation of either Lck-binding:__entity__ domain:__entity__ abolished the ability of Tip:__entity__ to stimulate NF-AT:__entity__ -dependent transcription .
Full biological activity of Tip:__entity__ , therefore , appears to require both Lck-binding:__entity__ domains:__entity__ .
Accumulation of RXR:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ during activation of cycling human T lymphocytes : modulation of RXRE transactivation function by mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways .
We have previously reported that the activation of resting human immature peripheral blood T ( PBT ) lymphocytes is associated with the loss of retinoid:__entity__ X:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ ( RXRalpha:__entity__ ) expression .
In the present study , we have demonstrated that , unlike resting cells , activation of cycling human mature PBT lymphocytes , and T lymphocyte leukemia cell lines is accompanied by the accumulation of RXRalpha:__entity__ mRNA and protein .
Interestingly , cyclosporin A further augmented RXRalpha:__entity__ expression , indicating the involvement of calcineurin pathways in the process .
9-cis retinoic acid inhibited the accumulation , suggesting that retinoids can regulate the synthesis of their own receptors during T cell activation .
Transfection analysis in Jurkat cells , using RXRE-dependent reporter assays , showed that RXRalpha:__entity__ accumulated during T cell activation was transcriptionally inactive .
To investigate the mechanism of such inhibition , the role of two mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways , c-Jun:__entity__ N-terminal:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ ( JNK:__entity__ ) and extracellular:__entity__ signal-regulated:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ ( ERK:__entity__ ) , in modulating RXRE-dependent transcription , was explored .
The expression of constitutively active MAP/ERK:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ 1:__entity__ ( MEKK1:__entity__ ) inhibited RXRE-dependent transcription , whereas dominant:__entity__ negative:__entity__ MEKK1:__entity__ increased the transcription , indicating the involvement of JNK:__entity__ signaling pathways in the process .
In contrast , expression of constitutively:__entity__ active:__entity__ MEK1:__entity__ , which activates ERK:__entity__ pathway , enhanced RXRE-dependent activation .
When both were activated simultaneously , JNK:__entity__ pathway was dominant over ERK:__entity__ pathway and resulted in inhibition of RXRE-mediated transcription .
These data demonstrate a dual regulatory control of RXRalpha:__entity__ expression during the activation of resting and cycling T lymphocytes and indicate a dynamic balance between JNK and ERK pathways in modulating RXRE-mediated transactivation .
The proteasome:__entity__ regulates receptor-mediated endocytosis of interleukin-2:__entity__ .
Recent studies have increasingly implicated the proteasome:__entity__ in the regulation of cell:__entity__ surface:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ .
In the present study , we investigated the role of the proteasome:__entity__ for ligand-dependent endocytosis and degradation of the interleukin-2:__entity__ (:__entity__ IL-2:__entity__ ):__entity__ -interleukin-2:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ (:__entity__ IL-2R:__entity__ ):__entity__ complex:__entity__ .
Proteasome inhibitors impaired internalization of IL-2.IL-2R:__entity__ and prevented the lysosomal degradation of this cytokine:__entity__ .
Based on time-course studies , proteasome:__entity__ activity is primarily required after initial endocytosis of the IL-2.IL-2R:__entity__ .
Proteasome function was also necessary for the lysosomal degradation of IL-2:__entity__ internalized by IL-2R:__entity__ that were comprised of cytoplasmic:__entity__ tailless:__entity__ beta-:__entity__ or:__entity__ gamma:__entity__ c-subunits:__entity__ , suggesting that the target protein for the proteasome:__entity__ is independent of either the cytoplasmic:__entity__ tail:__entity__ of the IL-2R:__entity__ beta-:__entity__ or:__entity__ gamma:__entity__ c-subunits:__entity__ and their associated signaling components .
Therefore , a functional proteasome:__entity__ is required for optimal endocytosis of the IL-2R/ligand:__entity__ complex:__entity__ and is essential for the subsequent lysosomal degradation of IL-2:__entity__ , possibly by regulating trafficking to the lysosome .
Functional characterization of the two alternative promoters of human:__entity__ p45:__entity__ NF-E2:__entity__ gene:__entity__ .
OBJECTIVE : The transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ NF-E2:__entity__ , a heterodimeric:__entity__ protein:__entity__ complex:__entity__ composed of p45:__entity__ and small Maf:__entity__ family:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ , is considered crucial for the proper differentiation of erythrocytes and megakaryocytes in vivo .
We report the results of studies aimed at understanding the regulatory mechanisms controlling p45:__entity__ gene:__entity__ expression in erythroid cells .
MATERIALS AND METHODS : Human:__entity__ p45:__entity__ mRNAs:__entity__ have two alternative isoforms , aNF-E2:__entity__ and fNF-E2:__entity__ , and these isoforms are transcribed from the alternative:__entity__ promoters:__entity__ .
We investigated lineage-specific expression of both isomers in human erythroid and megakaryocytic cells by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or Northern blot analysis .
For functional characterization of both promoters , plasmids in which reporter:__entity__ genes:__entity__ were placed under the control of a series of truncated or mutated promoter:__entity__ fragments:__entity__ were transfected to human hematopoietic cell lines .
RESULTS : When CD34 ( + ) cells isolated from human cord blood were induced to unilineage erythroid or megakaryocytic differentiation in liquid suspension culture , both transcripts , although barely detected at day 0 , were induced in both erythroid and megakaryocytic cultures .
fNF-E2:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ was found to be more abundant in erythroid cells than megakaryocytic cells at day 7 of culture .
Although both isomers were expressed in human erythroid-megakaryocytic cell lines , megakaryocytic maturation with loss of erythroid phenotype induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) resulted in exclusive downregulation of fNF-E2:__entity__ , suggesting that fNF-E2:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ is more erythroid specific .
Functional analysis of fNF-E2:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ showed that the promoter is active only in erythroid-megakaryocytic cells and that the double:__entity__ GATA:__entity__ sit:__entity__ e in the proximal region is necessary for its efficient activity .
CONCLUSION : These results suggest that GATA:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ , which govern the differentiation of erythroid lineage cells , are required for full promoter activity of the p45:__entity__ gene:__entity__ .
Transcriptional activation of heme:__entity__ oxygenase-1:__entity__ and its functional significance in acetaminophen-induced hepatitis and hepatocellular injury in the rat .
BACKGROUND/AIM : Glutathione depletion contributes to acetaminophen hepatotoxicity and is known to induce the oxidative stress reactant heme:__entity__ oxygenase-1:__entity__ .
The metabolites of the heme oxygenase pathway , biliverdin , carbon monoxide , and iron may modulate acetaminophen toxicity .
The aim of this study was to assess cell-type specific expression of heme:__entity__ oxygenase-1:__entity__ and its impact on liver injury and microcirculatory disturbances in a model of acetaminophen-induced hepatitis .
METHODS : Gene expression of heme:__entity__ oxygenase-1:__entity__ was studied by Northern- and Western analysis as well as immunohistochemistry .
The time course of heme:__entity__ oxygenase-1:__entity__ and:__entity__ -2:__entity__ , cytokine-induced:__entity__ neutrophil:__entity__ chemoattractant-1:__entity__ , and intercellular:__entity__ adhesion:__entity__ molecule-1:__entity__ was studied by Northern analysis .
DNA-binding activity of nuclear:__entity__ factor-kappaB:__entity__ was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
Sinusoidal perfusion and leukocyte-endothelial interactions were assessed by intravital microscopy .
RESULTS : Acetaminophen caused a moderate sinusoidal perfusion failure ( -15 % ) and infiltration of neutrophils along with activation of nuclear:__entity__ factor-kappaB:__entity__ and intercellular:__entity__ adhesion:__entity__ molecule-1:__entity__ and cytokine-induced:__entity__ neutrophil:__entity__ chemoattractant-1:__entity__ mRNAs .
Induction of heme:__entity__ oxygenase-1:__entity__ mRNA and protein ( approximately 30-fold ) in hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells paralleled the inflammatory response .
Blockade of heme oxygenase activity with tin-protoporphyrin-IX abrogated acetaminophen-induced hepatic neutrophil accumulation and nuclear:__entity__ factor-kappaB:__entity__ activation , but failed to affect sinusoidal perfusion and liver injury .
CONCLUSIONS : The inflammatory response associated with acetaminophen hepatotoxicity is modulated by the parallel induction of the heme:__entity__ oxygenase-1:__entity__ gene:__entity__ .
However , heme:__entity__ oxygenase-1:__entity__ has no permissive effect on sinusoidal perfusion and does not affect liver injury in this model .
These data argue against a central role of nuclear:__entity__ factor-kappaB:__entity__ activation and neutrophil infiltration as perpetuating factors of liver injury in acetaminophen toxicity .
Tumor:__entity__ necrosis:__entity__ factor-alpha:__entity__ -induced proliferation requires synthesis of granulocyte-macrophage:__entity__ colony-stimulating:__entity__ factor:__entity__ .
OBJECTIVE : Tumor:__entity__ necrosis:__entity__ factor-:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ ( TNF-alpha:__entity__ ) induces a variety of cellular responses , some of them being at least seemingly contradictory .
Thus , we set out to find differences in the modes of proliferative and apoptotic responses to TNF-:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ .
MATERIALS AND METHODS : We screened a panel of acute myeloid leukemia-derived cell lines for TNF-:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ -responsiveness .
In two lines ( OCI-AML-1 , OCI-AML-11 ) , TNF-:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ acted as an apoptotic agent ; in others ( HU-3 , M-07e , TF-1 ) , it had the opposite effect , preventing apoptosis and inducing proliferation .
Direct and indirect signaling mechanisms , including NF-kappaB:__entity__ activation and cytokine synthesis , were analyzed .
RESULTS : All cell lines tested expressed TNF-:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ I:__entity__ and:__entity__ II:__entity__ and responded to TNF-:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ by upregulation of intercellular:__entity__ adhesion:__entity__ molecule-1:__entity__ .
In contrast to granulocyte-macrophage:__entity__ colony-stimulating:__entity__ factor:__entity__ ( GM-CSF:__entity__ ) , TNF-:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ did not activate the MAP:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ and p70S6 kinase pathways .
Nevertheless , inhibitors of these pathways clearly reduced the TNF-alpha:__entity__ -induced cell growth , indicating that TNF- alpha-proliferative cells produced a growth factor that induced proliferation upon stimulation of the above pathways .
Anti-GM-CSF:__entity__ antibodies:__entity__ inhibited the TNF-alpha:__entity__ -induced growth , suggesting the presence of an autocrine loop for cell proliferation mediated by GM-CSF:__entity__ .
Supporting this notion , TNF-alpha:__entity__ -induced upregulation of GM-CSF:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ levels and protein secretion in the TNF-alpha:__entity__ -proliferative , but not in the TNF-alpha-apoptotic cell lines .
CONCLUSION : These data identify GM-CSF:__entity__ synthesis as an early and essential step in TNF- alpha-induced proliferation .
We show for the first time that TNF-alpha-treated cell lines producing no or only minimal amounts of GM-CSF:__entity__ demonstrate an apoptotic phenotype , while cell lines with high GM-CSF:__entity__ expression rates can escape from growth arrest or even apoptosis .
In this context , we discuss arguments pointing at NF-kappaB:__entity__ as regulator of GM-CSF:__entity__ synthesis and thus indirectly as regulator for the escape of TNF-alpha:__entity__ -induced apoptosis
Glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ content of T lymphocytes : evidence for heterogeneity .
Glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ were measured in T lymphocytes that were isolated from peripheral blood by either nylon wool filtration or E-rosette sedimentation .
T cells isolated by nylon wool filtration specifically bind 6.7 +/- 0.2 fmol of dexamethasone per million cells ( equivalent to 4000 +/- 200 receptors per cell ) , whereas T cells isolated by E-rosette sedimentation bind 12.0 +/- 0.7 fmol of dexamethasone per million cells ( equivalent to 7200 +/- 400 receptors per cell ) .
This difference in the amount of dexamethasone bound by the two T cell preparations was significant ( p less than .001 ) and was present immediately after cell isolation .
The binding affinities of the different T cell preparations for dexamethasone were similar .
T cells that are isolated by a combination of nylon wool filtration followed by E-rosette sedimentation bind the same amount of dexamethasone as T cells isolated by nylon wool filtration alone .
T cells isolated by a combination of E-rosette sedimentation following by nylon wool filtration bind less dexamethasone than do T cells isolated by E-rosette sedimentation alone .
These findings suggest that T cells are heterogeneous with respect to their quantity of glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ .
Isolation of T cells by E-rosette sedimentation enriches for T cells that have a greater number of glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ , and isolation of T cells by nylon wool filtration enriches for T cells that have a lesser number of glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ .
Glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ and glucocorticoid sensitivity of human leukemic cells .
We have established optimal conditions for the measurement of glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ ( GR:__entity__ ) in human white cells using a whole-cell binding assay with [ 3H ] dexamethasone as the ligand , and the subsequent determination of the GR:__entity__ content in normal human lymphocytes and in leukemic cells of patients with various forms of acute and chronic leukemia .
A number of leukemia cell lines in continuous culture were also subjected to the GR:__entity__ assay , and the results were correlated with the sensitivity of these cell lines to glucocorticoid steroids in vitro .
The GR:__entity__ content of normal human lymphocytes amounted to 4 , 850 +/- 1 , 340 ( mean +/- SD ) receptors/cell .
The mean equilibrium dissociation constant ( KD ) of the interaction of [ 3H ] dexamethasone with the GR:__entity__ was 1.2 x 10 ( -8 ) M .
Steroidal compounds with a known glucocorticoid potency effectively competed for the binding , whereas steroids devoid of glucocorticoid activity ( e.g. estradiol-17 beta and testosterone ) were ineffective .
The GR:__entity__ content of the blast cells obtained from eight patients suffering from acute leukemia and four patients with a blast crisis of chronic myelocytic leukemia was found to be highly variable ( 3 , 230-29 , 900 receptors/cell ) , while the lymphocytes of six patients with chronic lymphatic leukemia contained a rather stable GR:__entity__ content ( 2 , 930-5 , 120 receptors/cell ) , which was comparable with that of normal lymphocytes .
GR:__entity__ was identified in all the 12 malignant continuous white cell lines studied .
Large cells contained more GR:__entity__ than the smaller ones .
There was no apparent correlation between the GR:__entity__ concentration and the sensitivity of the cells in vitro to glucocorticoids as judged by [ 3H ] thymidine incorporation studies .
Distribution of the surface markers in the leukemic cell lines did not relate to the GR:__entity__ concentration .
We conclude that the presence of GR:__entity__ is probably a universal feature of the leukemic cells , and , from a clinical standpoint , probably does not alone imply steroid responsiveness .
Evidence for a steroid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ in rheumatoid synovial tissue cells .
One mechanism by which glucocorticoids could exert their anti-inflammatory action is via rapidly saturable , stereo-specific:__entity__ cytoplasmic:__entity__ protein:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ .
This report is of an investigation into such a possibility in synovial cells .
Synovium , obtained from knee joints of rheumatoid patients undergoing surgery , was incubated with clostridiopeptidase:__entity__ A:__entity__ and trypsin-EDTA:__entity__ to obtain cell suspensions .
These , together with cells obtained from synovial fluid aspirated from patients with rheumatoid arthritis , were identified by electron microscopy .
Duplicate samples of these cell suspensions were incubated with increasing concentrations of H3Dexamethasone ( 1 x 10 ( -10 ) M-1 x 10 ( -9 ) M ) for 30 minutes at 37 degrees C .
Analysis of the proportion of steroid bound to whole cells showed evidence for specific , rapidly saturable , receptors in the cells obtained from synovial tissue , but this was not found in synovial fluid cells .
Electron micrographs showed that cells obtained from synovial tissue consisted of synovial fibroblast - and macrophage-types , lymphocytes , monocytes and macrophages .
Polymorphonuclear leucocytes appeared to be absent .
However , in synovial fluid cell type polymorphonuclear leucocytes were the predominant cell type .
We concluded from this , that one or more of the cell types present in synovial tissue contain a specific:__entity__ steroid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ , but that this is lacking in synovial fluid polymorphonuclear leucocytes .
Clinical implications of glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ in human leukemia .
Glucorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ were studied in various populations of normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes and leukemic lymphoblasts .
Normal lymphocytes contain low levels of glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ ( approximately 2 , 500 sites/cell ) which are identical in T- and non-T-fractions .
Phytohemagglutinin:__entity__ treatment increases levels about 3-fold .
Leukemic lymphoblasts contain larger numbers of receptor sites .
Presence of receptor is correlated with in vitro sensitivitiy to glucocorticoids and in vivo response to therapy .
Quantity of receptor is also correlated with complete remission duration independently of leukemic cell type ( T or null ) , initial WBC , or age of patient .
Quantitative determination of glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ levels in acute lymphoblastic leukemia may be of value both as an independent prognostic variable and in suggesting which patients should receive glucocorticoid therapy .
Functional and physical interaction of protein-tyrosine:__entity__ kinases:__entity__ Fyn:__entity__ and:__entity__ Csk:__entity__ in the T-cell signaling system .
The Src-like:__entity__ protein-tyrosine:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ Fyn:__entity__ is associated with T-cell:__entity__ antigen:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ .
Transient expression of actively mutated Fyn:__entity__ , having Phe-528 instead of Tyr-528 or Thr-338 instead of Ile-338 , in Jurkat T-cells stimulated:__entity__ the:__entity__ serum:__entity__ response:__entity__ element:__entity__ ( SRE:__entity__ ) , 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate:__entity__ response:__entity__ element:__entity__ , cyclic:__entity__ AMP:__entity__ response:__entity__ element:__entity__ , and c-fos:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ .
The stimulation of SRE:__entity__ was particularly prominent not only with active Fyn:__entity__ but also with normal:__entity__ (:__entity__ wild-type:__entity__ ):__entity__ Fyn:__entity__ .
SRE:__entity__ was also stimulated by both normal:__entity__ and:__entity__ active:__entity__ Lck:__entity__ .
Furthermore , normal:__entity__ and:__entity__ active:__entity__ Fyn:__entity__ stimulated transcription from the IL-2:__entity__ gene:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ when transfected cells were stimulated by concanavalin:__entity__ A:__entity__ plus 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate .
Under the same conditions , Lck:__entity__ did not stimulate IL-2:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ unless it was activated by mutation .
Interestingly , a mutant:__entity__ Fyn:__entity__ , which has deletions within the SH2:__entity__ region:__entity__ and so is able to transform chicken embryo fibroblasts , did not stimulate either the c-fos:__entity__ or:__entity__ IL-2:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ , suggesting the importance of this region in T-cell signaling .
Csk:__entity__ , which phosphorylates tyrosine residues in the negative regulatory sites of Src:__entity__ family:__entity__ kinases:__entity__ , down-regulated Fyn- and Lck-mediated stimulation of the serum:__entity__ response:__entity__ element:__entity__ and Fyn-mediated enhancement of IL-2:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ activity .
These data suggest that Fyn:__entity__ and Lck:__entity__ , whose activities are regulated by Csk:__entity__ , are involved in different phases of T-cell activation .
A novel NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ complex:__entity__ containing p65:__entity__ homodimers:__entity__ : implications for transcriptional control at the level of subunit dimerization .
The predominant inducible form of the NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ is a heteromeric:__entity__ complex:__entity__ containing two Rel-related:__entity__ DNA-binding:__entity__ subunits:__entity__ , termed:__entity__ p65:__entity__ and p50:__entity__ .
Prior transfection studies have shown that when these p65:__entity__ and:__entity__ p50:__entity__ subunits:__entity__ are expressed independently as stable:__entity__ homodimers:__entity__ , p65:__entity__ stimulates kappa B-directed transcription , whereas p50:__entity__ functions as a kappa B-specific repressor .
While authentic p50:__entity__ homodimers:__entity__ ( previously termed KBF1:__entity__ ) have been detected in nuclear extracts from nontransfected cells , experimental evidence supporting the existence of p65:__entity__ homodimers:__entity__ in vivo was lacking .
We now provide direct biochemical evidence for the presence of an endogenous pool of inducible p65:__entity__ homodimers:__entity__ in intact human T cells .
As with the prototypical NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ p50-p65:__entity__ heterodimer:__entity__ , this novel p65:__entity__ homodimeric:__entity__ form:__entity__ of NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ is functionally sequestered in the cytoplasm but rapidly appears in the nuclear compartment following cellular stimulation .
Site-directed mutagenesis studies indicate that the homodimerization function of p65:__entity__ is dependent upon the presence of cysteine 216 and a conserved recognition motif for protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ A:__entity__ ( RRPS:__entity__ ; amino acids 273 to 276 ) , both of which reside within a 91-amino-acid segment of the Rel:__entity__ homology:__entity__ domain:__entity__ that mediates self-association .
In contrast , mutations at these two sites do not affect heterodimerization of p65:__entity__ with p50:__entity__ or its functional interaction with I kappa B alpha .
These later findings indicate that neither homo- nor heterodimer formation is an absolute prerequisite for I:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ recognition of p65:__entity__ .
Taken together with prior in vivo transcription studies , these results suggest that the biological activities of p65:__entity__ and:__entity__ p50:__entity__ homodimers:__entity__ are independently regulated , thereby providing an integrated and flexible control mechanism for the rapid activation and repression of NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ / Rel:__entity__ -directed gene expression .
Carrier determination for X-linked agammaglobulinemia using X inactivation analysis of purified B cells .
We report the development of a relatively quick and simple method for the assessment of X inactivation status for carrier determination in families affected by X-linked agammaglobulinemia ( XLA ) .
This method utilises an immunomagnetic separation technique for B cell purification and a polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) based assay for the determination of methylation status at the androgen:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ (:__entity__ AR:__entity__ ):__entity__ gene:__entity__ locus:__entity__ to assess whether X inactivation is random or non-random at this locus .
We report the results we have obtained using this assay to investigate females known to be carriers of various X-linked immunodeficiency disorders .
In addition , we investigated four females from different families affected by XLA , two of whom were of unknown carrier status , and we discuss the results obtained with this and other X-inactivation assays .
A similar assay has recently been described by Allen et al. ( 1992 ) and applied to members of one family affected by XLA .
Effects of IL-4:__entity__ and Fc:__entity__ gamma:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ II:__entity__ engagement on Egr-1:__entity__ expression during stimulation of B lymphocytes by membrane immunoglobulin crosslinking .
Egr-1:__entity__ is an immediate:__entity__ early:__entity__ gene:__entity__ that is rapidly upregulated in response to mitogenic signals induced by antigen receptor crosslinking on murine B lymphocytes .
It has been shown that levels of Egr-1:__entity__ expression are closely correlated with B cell proliferation in several models of B cell activation and tolerance .
We compared the expression of Egr-1:__entity__ during B cell stimulation with Fab'2:__entity__ and IgG:__entity__ anti-immunoglobulin:__entity__ ( anti-Ig:__entity__ ) , since it is known that Fab'2:__entity__ anti-Ig:__entity__ is mitogenic while IgG:__entity__ anti-Ig:__entity__ is not , owing to a dominant inhibitory effect of crosslinking the B:__entity__ cell:__entity__ Fc:__entity__ gamma:__entity__ RII:__entity__ to membrane:__entity__ Ig:__entity__ .
While mitogenic doses of Fab'2:__entity__ anti-Ig:__entity__ induce large and rapid increases in Egr-1 expression , IgG:__entity__ anti-Ig:__entity__ results in smaller increases in Egr-1:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ , comparable to that seen with submitogenic concentrations of Fab'2:__entity__ anti-Ig:__entity__ .
However , the correlation between Egr-1 expression and B cell proliferation breaks down when IL-4:__entity__ is added as a co-mitogen to induce B cell proliferation with IgG:__entity__ anti-Ig:__entity__ or submitogenic concentrations of Fab'2:__entity__ anti-Ig:__entity__ .
No corresponding increases in Egr-1:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ levels are observed when IL-4:__entity__ is added .
Therefore , IL-4:__entity__ overcomes Fc receptor-mediated inhibition of B cell proliferation without affecting inhibition of Egr-1:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ induction , as demonstrated earlier for c-myc:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ in this system .
Identification of a novel cyclosporin-sensitive:__entity__ element:__entity__ in the human:__entity__ tumor:__entity__ necrosis:__entity__ factor:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ gene:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ .
Tumor:__entity__ necrosis:__entity__ factor:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ ( TNF-alpha:__entity__ ) , a cytokine:__entity__ with pleiotropic biological effects , is produced by a variety of cell types in response to induction by diverse stimuli .
In this paper , TNF-alpha:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ is shown to be highly induced in a murine T cell clone by stimulation with T:__entity__ cell:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ ( TCR:__entity__ ) ligands or by calcium ionophores alone .
Induction is rapid , does not require de novo protein synthesis , and is completely blocked by the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A ( CsA ) .
We have identified a human:__entity__ TNF-alpha:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ element:__entity__ , kappa:__entity__ 3:__entity__ , which plays a key role in the calcium-mediated inducibility and CsA sensitivity of the gene .
In electrophoretic mobility shift assays , an oligonucleotide containing kappa:__entity__ 3:__entity__ forms two DNA protein complexes with proteins that are present in extracts from unstimulated T cells .
These complexes appear in nuclear extracts only after T cell stimulation .
Induction of the inducible nuclear:__entity__ complexes:__entity__ is rapid , independent of protein synthesis , and blocked by CsA , and thus , exactly parallels the induction of TNF-alpha:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ by TCR ligands or by calcium ionophore .
Our studies indicate that the kappa:__entity__ 3:__entity__ binding:__entity__ factor:__entity__ resembles the preexisting component of nuclear:__entity__ factor:__entity__ of activated T cells .
Thus , the TNF-alpha:__entity__ gene:__entity__ is an immediate early gene in activated T cells and provides a new model system in which to study CsA-sensitive:__entity__ gene:__entity__ induction in activated T cells .
Differences in expression of transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ AP-1:__entity__ in human promyelocytic HL-60 cells during differentiation towards macrophages versus granulocytes .
Commitment of HL-60 cells to macrophage or granulocytic differentiation was achieved by incubation with 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) for 30-60 min or with dimethyl sulphoxide ( DMSO ) for 24 h respectively .
The commitment stage towards PMA-induced macrophage differentiation was associated with increases in jun B and c-fos mRNA levels , as well as with an increase in the binding activity of transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ AP-1:__entity__ .
Nevertheless , gel retardation analysis indicated that the AP-1:__entity__ activity detected in untreated cells was drastically reduced during the commitment stage of DMSO-induced HL-60 differentiation towards granulocytes .
When HL-60 cells were treated with sodium butyrate , which induced monocytic differentiation , a remarkable increase in AP-1 binding activity was detected .
Treatment of HL-60 cells with 1 alpha , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 , another monocytic differentiation agent , induced a weak , but appreciable , increase in AP-1:__entity__ activity .
Furthermore , addition of sodium butyrate or 1 alpha , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 to HL-60 cells induced the expression of c-fos:__entity__ ,:__entity__ c-jun:__entity__ ,:__entity__ jun:__entity__ B:__entity__ and:__entity__ jun:__entity__ D:__entity__ proto-oncogenes:__entity__ .
In contrast , when HL-60 cells were treated with retinoic acid , a granulocytic differentiation inducer , no enhanced AP-1 binding activity was observed , and only a weak increase in jun:__entity__ D:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ level was detected .
These data indicate that formation of AP-1:__entity__ is not required for the induction of HL-60 differentiation towards granulocytes , whereas induction of monocytic differentiation is correlated with an increase in AP-1:__entity__ activity .
The differential expression of AP-1:__entity__ activity may be critical in the differentiation of HL-60 cells towards monocytic or granulocytic lineages
Glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ and sensitivity in leukemias .
In an attempt to investigate the utility of glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ determination to predict clinical responsiveness in human leukemias we have studied glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ in the leukemic cells from 46 patients and in the lymphocytes from 18 normal donors .
In the normal lymphocytes there were 3 , 875 ( Median ) specific binding sites per cell .
The blasts from 17 patients with ANLL had on average higher levels of binding:__entity__ sites:__entity__ per cell ( Median = 7 , 250 , range : 0 to 15 , 295 ) than the other leukemias .
Of the 15 patients with CLL , six had received glucocorticoid treatment for 3 to 5 years .
Their lymphocytes had lower number of receptors ( Median = 2 , 000 ) than the other cases which were newly diagnosed ( Median = 4 , 500 ) .
Four patients had ALL/AUL , three patients had blast crisis as terminal phase of CML , and seven had leukemic Non-Hodgkin lymphomas ( Median = 3 , 500 sites/cell ) .
In 24 patients we have also studied the in vitro sensitivity of the leukemic cells to dexamethasone .
There was no marked correlation between glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ levels and in vitro sensitivity .
An attempt to correlate receptor levels with clinical responsiveness demonstrated that glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ determination might be of value in patients with lymphoid malignancies but probably not in patients with other leukemias .
'Activation-labile:__entity__ ':__entity__ glucocorticoid-receptor:__entity__ complexes:__entity__ of a steroid-resistant variant of CEM-C7 human lymphoid cells .
For cytoplasmic:__entity__ glucocorticoid-receptor:__entity__ complexes:__entity__ to enter and accumulate in the nucleus a temperature-dependent event , 'activation ' is required .
Activation can be achieved in vitro by increased ionic strength , dilution or gel filtration and is manifested by an increased affinity of steroid-receptor:__entity__ complex:__entity__ for DNA:__entity__ and an altered elution profile from ion-exchange resins .
Munck and Foley have shown that activated:__entity__ complexes:__entity__ isolated from thymocytes elute from DEAE-cellulose in a manner identical to complexes activated in vitro .
We report here that DEAE-cellulose chromatography of steroid-receptor:__entity__ complexes:__entity__ from CEM-C7 , a cloned human leukaemic T-cell line sensitive to the cytolytic action of glucocorticoids , and its steroid-resistant subclone 4R4 demonstrated that steroid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ of clone 4R4 can not form stable activated complexes .
This defines a new defect in receptor action , activation lability ( r+act1 ) , which is unlike either the r- , r+nt- , or r+nti phenotypes previously described for mouse lymphoid variants .
Granulocytes in the endometrium of post-partum women .
Endometrial samples of women at various stages of gonadal activity after parturition were examined for the presence and numbers of endometrial granulocytes .
Although samples at all the stages contained significant numbers of the granulocytes ( i.e. greater than 7/high-power field ) , the 100 % values for late-proliferative and adaptation hyperplasia were significantly higher than the values for the resting ( 81.8 % ) , early ( 82.4 % ) and mid- ( 87.9 % ) proliferative and secretory ( 83.3 % ) phases .
We suggest that this correlates with the suggestion that the granulocytes constitute a receptor system for oestrogens .
Interaction of glucocorticoids with macrophages .
Identification of glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ in monocytes and macrophages .
Glucocorticoid binding was measured in resident and thioglycollate-elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages , rabbit alveolar macrophages , and human monocytes .
Two assays of binding were used -- an assay with intact cells in suspension or monolayers , and an assay of cytosol and nuclear forms of glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ .
The mononuclear phagocytes contained approximately equal to 4 -- 10 X 10 ( 3 ) high:__entity__ affinity:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ sites:__entity__ per cell , with dissociation constants of approximately equal to 2 -- 8 nM dexamethasone .
The binding to the saturable:__entity__ sites:__entity__ was specific for steroids with glucocorticoid or antiglucocorticoid activity .
Cortisol , corticosterone , and progesterone competed with dexamethasone for binding , whereas estradiol , dihydrotestosterone , and 11-epicortisol competed very little .
Binding of dexamethasone to cytosol and nuclear forms of the receptor:__entity__ complex:__entity__ and temperature-sensitive translocation of cytosol forms to nuclear forms were shown .
At 37 degrees C the predominant form of the hormone-receptor:__entity__ complex:__entity__ was nuclear .
These results demonstrate that corticosteroids interact with macrophages at physiological concentrations .
Nitric oxide signaling : a possible role for G:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ .
We have previously reported various inductive effects of nitric oxide on human PBMC .
We describe a novel and potentially important mechanism of nitric oxide signaling-through direct activation of guanine:__entity__ nucleotide-binding:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ ( G:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ ) .
We have found that nitric oxide treatment of membranes isolated from fresh human PBMC enhances the ability of these membranes to hydrolyze [ gamma-32P ] GTP and bind [ gamma-35S ] GTP .
In addition , treatment of whole cells with nitric oxide yielded membranes with enhanced GTPase activity .
Furthermore , the GTPase activity of pure , recombinant Gs:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ , Gi:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ 1:__entity__ , and p21ras:__entity__ was greatly enhanced by nitric oxide .
In support of the existence of this pathway in whole cells , we found that the G protein inhibitor , GDP-beta-S , blocked NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ translocation induced by nitric oxide or LPS in permeabilized cells .
In addition , nitric oxide greatly reduced the pertussis toxin-mediated ADP-ribosylation of 45-:__entity__ and:__entity__ 41-kDa:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ in membranes of these cells .
Because G:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ play a central role in many diverse signaling systems , activation by an endogenous and inducible oxidant may represent a novel signaling pathway .
The granulocyte-macrophage:__entity__ colony-stimulating:__entity__ factor:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ cis-acting:__entity__ element:__entity__ CLE0:__entity__ mediates induction signals in T cells and is recognized by factors related to AP1:__entity__ and NFAT:__entity__ .
Expression of the granulocyte-macrophage:__entity__ colony-stimulating:__entity__ factor:__entity__ (:__entity__ GM-CSF:__entity__ ):__entity__ gene:__entity__ in T cells is activated by the combination of phorbol ester ( phorbol myristate acetate ) and calcium ionophore ( A23187 ) , which mimic antigen stimulation through the T-cell:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ .
We have previously shown that a fragment containing bp:__entity__ -95:__entity__ to:__entity__ +27:__entity__ of the mouse:__entity__ GM-CSF:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ can confer inducibility to reporter:__entity__ genes:__entity__ in the human Jurkat T-cell line .
Here we use an in vitro transcription system to demonstrate that a cis-acting:__entity__ element:__entity__ ( positions:__entity__ -54:__entity__ to:__entity__ -40:__entity__ ) , referred to as CLE0:__entity__ , is a target for the induction signals .
We observed induction with templates containing intact CLE0:__entity__ but not with templates with deleted:__entity__ or:__entity__ mutated:__entity__ CLE0:__entity__ .
We also observed that two distinct signals were required for the stimulation through CLE0:__entity__ , since only extracts from cells treated with both phorbol myristate acetate and A23187 supported optimal induction .
Stimulation probably was mediated by CLE0-binding:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ because depletion of these proteins specifically reduced GM-CSF:__entity__ transcription .
One of the binding:__entity__ factors:__entity__ possessed biochemical and immunological features identical to those of the transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ AP1:__entity__ .
Another factor resembled the T-cell-specific:__entity__ factor:__entity__ NFAT:__entity__ .
The characteristics of these two factors are consistent with their involvement in GM-CSF induction .
The presence of CLE0-like:__entity__ elements:__entity__ in the promoters:__entity__ of interleukin-3:__entity__ (:__entity__ IL-3:__entity__ ):__entity__ ,:__entity__ IL-4:__entity__ ,:__entity__ IL-5:__entity__ ,:__entity__ GM-CSF:__entity__ ,:__entity__ and:__entity__ NFAT:__entity__ sites:__entity__ in the IL-2:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ suggests that the factors we detected , or related factors that recognize these sites , may account for the coordinate induction of these genes during T-cell activation .
Identification and characterization of an Alu-containing:__entity__ ,:__entity__ T-cell-specific:__entity__ enhancer:__entity__ located in the last intron:__entity__ of the human:__entity__ CD8:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ gene:__entity__ .
Expression of the human:__entity__ CD8:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ gene:__entity__ is restricted to cells of the lymphoid lineage and developmentally regulated during thymopoiesis .
As an initial step towards understanding the molecular basis for tissue-specific expression of this gene , we surveyed the surrounding chromatin structure for potential cis-acting:__entity__ regulatory:__entity__ regions:__entity__ by DNase:__entity__ I:__entity__ hypersensitivity mapping and found four hypersensitive sites , three of which were T cell restricted .
By using a reporter-based expression approach , a T-cell-specific:__entity__ enhancer:__entity__ was identified by its close association with a prominent T-cell-restricted:__entity__ hypersensitive:__entity__ sites:__entity__ in the last intron of the CD8:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ gene:__entity__ .
Deletion studies demonstrated that the minimal enhancer is adjacent to a negative regulatory element .
DNA sequence analysis of the minimal:__entity__ enhancer:__entity__ revealed a striking cluster of consensus:__entity__ binding:__entity__ sites:__entity__ for Ets-1:__entity__ ,:__entity__ TCF-1:__entity__ ,:__entity__ CRE:__entity__ ,:__entity__ GATA-3:__entity__ ,:__entity__ LyF-1:__entity__ ,:__entity__ and:__entity__ bHLH:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ which were verified by electrophoretic mobility shift assays .
In addition , the 5:__entity__ ':__entity__ end:__entity__ of the enhancer:__entity__ was composed of an Alu repeat which contained the GATA-3:__entity__ ,:__entity__ bHLH:__entity__ ,:__entity__ and:__entity__ LyF-1:__entity__ binding:__entity__ sites:__entity__ .
Site-directed mutation of the Ets-1:__entity__ and:__entity__ GATA-3:__entity__ sites:__entity__ dramatically reduced enhancer activity .
The functional importance of the other binding sites only became apparent when combinations of mutations were analyzed .
Taken together , these results suggest that the human:__entity__ CD8:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ gene:__entity__ is regulated by the interaction of multiple T-cell:__entity__ nuclear:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ with a transcriptional enhancer located in the last intron:__entity__ of the gene .
Comparison of the CD8:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ enhancer:__entity__ with other recently identified T-cell-specific:__entity__ regulatory:__entity__ elements:__entity__ suggests that a common set of transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ regulates several T-cell:__entity__ genes:__entity__ .
Molecular regulation of the human:__entity__ IL-3:__entity__ gene:__entity__ : inducible T cell-restricted expression requires intact AP-1:__entity__ and:__entity__ Elf-1:__entity__ nuclear:__entity__ protein:__entity__ binding:__entity__ sites:__entity__ .
Interleukin:__entity__ 3:__entity__ ( IL-3:__entity__ ) is a hematopoietic:__entity__ stem-cell:__entity__ growth:__entity__ and:__entity__ differentiation:__entity__ factor:__entity__ that is expressed solely in activated T and NK cells .
Studies to date have identified elements 5 ' to the IL-3:__entity__ coding:__entity__ sequences:__entity__ that regulate its transcription , but the sequences that confer T cell-specific expression remain to be clearly defined .
We have now identified DNA:__entity__ sequences:__entity__ that are required for T cell-restricted IL-3:__entity__ gene:__entity__ transcription .
A series of transient transfections performed with human:__entity__ IL-3-chloramphenicol:__entity__ acetyltransferase:__entity__ (:__entity__ CAT:__entity__ ):__entity__ reporter:__entity__ plasmids:__entity__ in T and non-T cells revealed that a plasmid:__entity__ containing 319 bp of 5:__entity__ ':__entity__ flanking:__entity__ sequences:__entity__ was active exclusively in T cells .
Deletion analysis revealed that T cell specificity was conferred by a 49-bp:__entity__ fragment:__entity__ ( bp:__entity__ -319:__entity__ to:__entity__ -270:__entity__ ) that included a potential:__entity__ binding:__entity__ site:__entity__ for AP-1:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ 6 bp upstream of a binding:__entity__ site:__entity__ for:__entity__ Elf-1:__entity__ , a member of the Ets:__entity__ family:__entity__ of transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ .
DNaseI:__entity__ footprint and electrophoretic mobility shift assay analyses performed with MLA-144 T cell nuclear extracts demonstrated that this 49-bp:__entity__ region:__entity__ contains a nuclear:__entity__ protein:__entity__ binding:__entity__ region:__entity__ that includes consensus:__entity__ AP-1:__entity__ and:__entity__ Elf-1:__entity__ binding:__entity__ sites:__entity__ .
In addition , extracts prepared from purified human T cells contained proteins that bound to synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to the AP-1:__entity__ and:__entity__ Elf-1:__entity__ binding:__entity__ sites:__entity__ .
In vitro-transcribed and -translated Elf-1:__entity__ protein:__entity__ bound specifically to the Elf-1:__entity__ site:__entity__ , and Elf-1 antisera competed and super shifted nuclear protein complexes present in MLA-144 nuclear extracts .
Moreover , addition of anti-Jun family antiserum in electrophoretic mobility shift assay reactions completely blocked formation of the AP-1-related:__entity__ complexes:__entity__ .
Transient transfection studies in MLA-144 T cells revealed that constructs containing mutations in the AP-1:__entity__ site:__entity__ almost completely abolished CAT activity while mutation of the Elf-1:__entity__ site:__entity__ or the NF-IL-3:__entity__ site:__entity__ , a previously described nuclear:__entity__ protein:__entity__ binding:__entity__ site:__entity__ ( bp.:__entity__ -155:__entity__ to:__entity__ -148:__entity__ ) in the IL-3:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ , reduced CAT activity to < 25 % of the activity given by wild-type constructs .
We conclude that expression of the human:__entity__ IL-3:__entity__ gene:__entity__ requires the AP-1:__entity__ and:__entity__ Elf-1:__entity__ binding:__entity__ sites:__entity__ ; however , unlike other previously characterized cytokine:__entity__ genes:__entity__ such as IL-2:__entity__ , the AP-1:__entity__ and:__entity__ Elf-1:__entity__ factors:__entity__ can bind independently in the IL-3:__entity__ gene:__entity__ .
( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS )
Combination IL-2:__entity__ and IL-4:__entity__ reduces glucocorticoid receptor-binding affinity and T cell response to glucocorticoids .
The mechanisms contributing to persistent T cell activation and poor response to glucocorticoids in chronic inflammatory illnesses such as steroid resistant ( SR ) asthma are poorly defined .
We examined the possibility that certain cytokines , specifically IL-2:__entity__ and IL-4:__entity__ , could affect T cell response to glucocorticoids .
A [ 3H ] dexamethasone radioligand-binding assay was used to measure the number of glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ ( GR:__entity__ ) and dissociation constant ( Kd ) in PBMC from normal donors and patients with SR asthma , cultured in the absence and presence of these cytokines:__entity__ .
PBMC from normal donors incubated for 48 h in the presence of combination IL-2:__entity__ + IL-4:__entity__ had nuclear GR with significantly reduced binding affinity ( GR Kd = 36.1 +/- 1.63 nM , mean +/- SEM ; p = 0.0001 ) as compared with PBMC incubated with medium alone ( GR Kd = 6.74 +/- 0.46 nM ) .
The cytosolic GR Kd remained unchanged .
However , when PBMC were incubated with IL-2:__entity__ alone or IL-4:__entity__ alone , no change in GR-binding affinity was observed .
Furthermore , when T cells and non-T cells were individually stimulated with combination IL-2 + IL-4 , a significant reduction in GR-binding affinity was observed only in the T cell population ( p = 0.0001 ) .
The IL-2 + IL-4-induced alteration in PBMC GR Kd was associated with an increase in GR number ( 8348 +/- 964 vs 1710 +/- 228 sites/cell ; p = 0.0003 ) .
More importantly , the alteration in PBMC GR-binding affinity with IL-2:__entity__ + IL-4:__entity__ was associated with a functional change in T cell response to methylprednisolone MPN , i.e. , a reduced inhibitory effect of MPN on PMA/ionomycin-induced T cell proliferation .
These effects of IL-2:__entity__ + IL-4:__entity__ on PBMC GR:__entity__ affinity and response to MPN were blocked by co-incubation with IFN-gamma:__entity__ .
Freshly isolated PBMC from four patients with SR asthma had a significantly reduced GR-binding affinity ( Kd = 40.0 +/- 2.68 nM ; p = 0.0001 ) when compared with seven normal subjects ( 7.15 +/- 0.41 nM ) .
The altered PBMC GR binding from patients with SR asthma reversed to normal when incubated with medium alone , but was sustained with IL-2:__entity__ + IL-4:__entity__ .
These observations suggest that with persistent inflammation certain cytokines:__entity__ may contribute to an impaired response to glucocorticoids .
Furthermore , the effects of IL-2:__entity__ and IL-4:__entity__ were blocked by IFN-gamma:__entity__ .
Characterization of the human:__entity__ CD4:__entity__ gene:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ : transcription from the CD4:__entity__ gene:__entity__ core:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ is tissue-specific and is activated by Ets:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ .
We analyzed the 5:__entity__ ':__entity__ transcription:__entity__ control:__entity__ sequences:__entity__ of the human:__entity__ CD4:__entity__ gene:__entity__ .
We located the transcription:__entity__ initiation:__entity__ site:__entity__ and showed that the CD4:__entity__ core:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ ( positions:__entity__ -40:__entity__ to:__entity__ +16:__entity__ ) lacks a classical `` TATA '' or initiator:__entity__ positioning:__entity__ consensus:__entity__ sequence:__entity__ but directs precise and efficient transcription when coupled to the ubiquitously active simian:__entity__ virus:__entity__ 40:__entity__ enhancer:__entity__ .
The transcriptional activity of the CD4:__entity__ gene:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ correlated with CD4 expression in various cell types .
Interestingly , the CD4:__entity__ core:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ also displayed a tissue-specific transcriptional activity .
Within this fragment , three nucleic acid sequences are completely conserved in the murine:__entity__ CD4:__entity__ gene:__entity__ .
One of these sequences contains a perfect:__entity__ ETS:__entity__ consensus:__entity__ sequence:__entity__ .
Another ETS:__entity__ consensus:__entity__ sequence:__entity__ is located 1060 nt upstream .
Electrophoretic-mobility-shift assays showed that the core promoter ETS motif binds an Ets-related:__entity__ protein:__entity__ specifically expressed at high levels in CD4+ cells .
Moreover , in CD4- cells , overexpression of Ets-1:__entity__ or Ets-2:__entity__ efficiently and specifically activated transcription from the CD4:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ and core:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ .
These data indicate that Ets:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ play a central role in controlling CD4 gene expression , by binding to both a classical:__entity__ remote:__entity__ site:__entity__ and an unusual proximal:__entity__ activator:__entity__ sequence:__entity__
Glucocorticoid receptor activation and inactivation in c ultured human lymphocytes .
Although glucocorticoids are not cytolytic for and do not inhibit the growth of the IM-9 line of cultured human lymphoblasts , these cells have a high steroid-binding capacity .
We have used IM-9 cells in order to examine whether unoccupied:__entity__ glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ are inactivated and activated in intact cells .
when IM-9 cells are incubated in glucose-free medium in a nitrogen atmosphere , both their ability to bind triamcinolone acetonide and their ATP levels decline and , when glucose and oxygen are reintroduced , ATP levels and receptor activity return .
The specific glucocorticoid-binding activity of cytosol prepared from cells exposed to various degrees of energy limitation is directly correlated with the ATP content .
Receptor activation in intact cells is rapid and independent of protein synthesis .
Cytosol prepared from inactivated cells can not be activated by addition of ATP .
The inactivation of glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ that occurs when cytosol from normal IM-9 cells is incubated at 25 degrees C is inhibited by molybdate , vanadate , fluoride , ATP , and several other nucleotides .
The experiments with intact human lymphoblasts suggest that assays of specific glucocorticoid-binding capacity do not necessarily reflect the cellular content of receptor:__entity__ protein:__entity__ .
Glucocorticoids and lymphocytes .
II .
Cell cycle-dependent changes in glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ content .
To study variations in glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ levels during the cell cycle , we have separated mitogen-stimulated human peripheral lymphocytes and rat lymph node cells by unit gravity sedimentation and measured glucocorticoid binding in the resultant fractions .
By morphologic criteria and thymidine incorporation , the fractions were separated into populations of G0 and G1 phase and S and post-S phase cells .
A 2- to 3-fold increase in glucocorticoid receptor sites per cell , for cells in the S and post-S phase over those in G0 and G1 , was observed with both nonstimulated rat lymph node cell suspensions and concanavalin A-stimulated human peripheral lymphocytes .
These observations together with those from other studies indicate that formation of new glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ near the S phase may be a general phenomenon in proliferating cells .
We propose that this increase in glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ during the cell cycle may explain the increase in glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ in mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes .
The leukocyte migration inhibition response to certain breast:__entity__ cancer-related:__entity__ antigens:__entity__ ( MCF-7:__entity__ and MuMTV:__entity__ ) : their potential as discriminants .
Certain oncogenic viruses have been implicated in human breast cancer , including the murine mammary tumor virus ( MuMTV ) and the Mason-Pfizer monkey virus ( MPMV ) .
We have used the leukocyte migration inhibition ( LMI ) response to assay the response to several potential breast cancer-related antigens , including MuMTV:__entity__ , MPMV:__entity__ , and a breast cancer cultured cell line , MCF-7 , in 96 breast cancer patients , in 32 women with benign breast disease , and in 67 normal women .
The lowest tenth percentile of control ( LMI ) responses was used as the cutoff point to designate responders .
Breast cancer patients showed significant responses to MuMTV:__entity__ ( 49 % and to MCF-7 ( 50 % ) , but not to MPMV:__entity__ ( 29 % ) .
In a paired-antigen study using MuMTV:__entity__ and MCF-7:__entity__ , 75 % of the breast cancer patients responded , versus 18 % of the normal women ( P less than 0.0050 ) .
The potential for this assay to distinguish `` normal '' from `` breast cancer '' was analyzed using a migration index derived from discriminant analysis .
The ability of the assay to discriminate `` normal '' from `` cancer '' was significant ( P less than 0.001 ) and showed a sensitivity of detecting `` cancer '' of 75 % .
The overall responses to MuMTV:__entity__ and MCF-7:__entity__ were analyzed with reference to certain prognostic factors , but showed no relation to age , menstrual status , estrogen receptor status , or stage of disease .
The above reactions suggest that a large proportion of breast cancer patients exhibit presensitization to antigenfs found in MuMTV:__entity__ and MCF-7:__entity__ , which may be cross-reactive with antigens in the primary cancer .
These responses appear to be independent of major prognostic variables .
Further refinement of this assay may yield one which is more highly discriminating for breast cancer .
Chronic lymphatic leukaemia : cellular effects of glucocorticoids in vitro .
Glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ levels and steroid induced inhibition of nucleic acid precursors have been examined in lymphocytes from 27 patients at different stages of chronic lymphatic leukaemia .
No correlation can be found between the level of glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ and the stage of the disease .
On the other hand , a significant difference ( P less than 0.02 ) was found between stage O and stage III/IV patients , in terms of the in vitro effect of dexamethasone on [ 3H ] uridine incorporation .
Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate inhibits NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ mobilization and TNF production in human monocytes .
The human:__entity__ TNF:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ contains four potential nuclear:__entity__ factor-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ (:__entity__ NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ ):__entity__ -binding:__entity__ sites:__entity__ , with the strongest binding seen for the -605 motif .
Nuclear extracts from unstimulated cells of the human monocytic cell line , Mono Mac 6 , contain one specific:__entity__ binding:__entity__ protein:__entity__ ( complex:__entity__ II:__entity__ ) , consistent with a constitutive:__entity__ p50:__entity__ homodimer:__entity__ .
Stimulation of Mono Mac 6 cells with LPS will increase complex:__entity__ II:__entity__ and will strongly induce a second specific complex ( complex:__entity__ I:__entity__ ) , which represents the p50/65:__entity__ heterodimer:__entity__ .
Treatment of Mono Mac 6 cells with pyrrolidine-dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) at 300 microM will block the LPS-induced:__entity__ complex:__entity__ I:__entity__ almost completely and will reduce complex:__entity__ II:__entity__ to the constitutive level .
Binding activity of other nuclear:__entity__ factors:__entity__ that recognize the SP-1 and c/EBP motifs of the human:__entity__ TNF:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ is not affected by such treatment .
Northern blot analysis demonstrates that PDTC treatment will strongly reduce LPS-induced:__entity__ TNF:__entity__ transcripts:__entity__ .
Secreted TNF:__entity__ protein:__entity__ as detected in the Wehi 164S/ActD bioassay and in a sandwich immunoassay was similarly reduced by PDTC .
Kinetic analyses show that after LPS stimulation , NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ will peak at 1 h , TNF transcript prevalence at 2 h , and TNF:__entity__ protein:__entity__ at 4 h .
PDTC did not shift this response to LPS to a later time , but suppressed NF-kappa B mobilization , TNF:__entity__ transcripts:__entity__ , and TNF:__entity__ protein:__entity__ over the entire 8-h observation period .
Analysis of freshly isolated , LPS-stimulated blood monocytes showed a similar blockade of NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ .
Furthermore , in these primary cells , induction of TNF:__entity__ transcripts:__entity__ , as determined by Northern blot analysis and by quantitative polymerase chain reaction , was prevented by PDTC as was TNF:__entity__ protein:__entity__ production .
These data show that dithiocarbamates can profoundly affect cytokine expression and suggest that NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ is involved in LPS-induced TNF gene expression in human monocytes .
Comparing regions of the Epstein-Barr:__entity__ virus:__entity__ ZEBRA:__entity__ protein:__entity__ which function as transcriptional:__entity__ activating:__entity__ sequences:__entity__ in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in B cells .
The ZEBRA:__entity__ protein:__entity__ activates expression of Epstein-Barr virus early-lytic-cycle:__entity__ genes:__entity__ in human B lymphocytes .
Here it is shown that ZEBRA:__entity__ also behaves as a sequence-specific:__entity__ transcriptional:__entity__ activator:__entity__ in Saccharomyces cerevisiae .
Deletional mutagenesis defined three regions of ZEBRA:__entity__ that participate in activation in S. cerevisiae .
These regions are designated YI:__entity__ ( amino:__entity__ acids:__entity__ [:__entity__ aa:__entity__ ]:__entity__ 1:__entity__ to:__entity__ 25:__entity__ ) , YII:__entity__ ( aa:__entity__ 51:__entity__ to:__entity__ 102:__entity__ ) , and YIII:__entity__ ( aa:__entity__ 228:__entity__ to:__entity__ 245:__entity__ ) .
Two of the three regions of the native ZEBRA:__entity__ protein:__entity__ act together to mediate activation when assayed on ZEBRA:__entity__ binding:__entity__ sites:__entity__ .
However , when fused to the DNA:__entity__ binding:__entity__ domain:__entity__ of GAL:__entity__ 4 and assayed on GAL4:__entity__ binding:__entity__ sites:__entity__ , regions:__entity__ YII:__entity__ and:__entity__ YIII:__entity__ were each sufficient to confer activation in S. cerevisiae .
Regions of ZEBRA:__entity__ which affected activation in S. cerevisiae were also required in human B lymphocytes .
The amino-terminal:__entity__ region:__entity__ of ZEBRA:__entity__ ( aa:__entity__ 1:__entity__ to:__entity__ 98:__entity__ ) was required for activation both in S. cerevisiae and in human B cells ; deletion of the carboxy-terminal:__entity__ 18:__entity__ aa:__entity__ also significantly reduced activation in both cell types .
Thus , the behavior of ZEBRA:__entity__ in human B cells and S. cerevisiae suggests that the protein contains universal:__entity__ activation:__entity__ motifs:__entity__ that interact with conserved components of the transcription machinery .
However , certain deletion:__entity__ mutants:__entity__ of ZEBRA:__entity__ containing mutations in the N-terminal:__entity__ region:__entity__ exhibited discordant behaviors in S. cerevisiae and in B cells .
For example , deletion of ZEBRA:__entity__ aa:__entity__ 26:__entity__ to:__entity__ 51:__entity__ impaired activation to a great extent in B cells but had little or no effect in S. cerevisiae .
The discordant mutants may reflect interactions with a variable:__entity__ domain:__entity__ of a conserved component or unique interactions with specialized components of the basal transcription apparatus in different cells .
Functional interaction of the v-Rel:__entity__ and:__entity__ c-Rel:__entity__ oncoproteins:__entity__ with the TATA-binding:__entity__ protein:__entity__ and association with transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ IIB:__entity__ .
Rel:__entity__ family:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ regulate the expression of genes linked to kappa B-binding motifs .
Little is known , however , of the mechanism by which they enhance transcription .
We have investigated the ability of the v-Rel:__entity__ and:__entity__ c-Rel:__entity__ oncoproteins:__entity__ to interact with components of the basal transcription machinery .
Here we report that both the acidic transcription activation domain mapping to the unique C:__entity__ terminus:__entity__ of chicken:__entity__ c-Rel:__entity__ and the F9:__entity__ cell-specific:__entity__ activation:__entity__ region:__entity__ common to both v-Rel:__entity__ and c-Rel:__entity__ interact with the TATA-binding:__entity__ protein:__entity__ ( TBP:__entity__ ) and transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ IIB:__entity__ ( TFIIB:__entity__ ) in vitro and in vivo .
We also demonstrate that TPB:__entity__ interaction with Rel:__entity__ activation:__entity__ regions:__entity__ leads to synergistic activation of transcription of a kappa:__entity__ B-linked:__entity__ reporter:__entity__ gene:__entity__ .
Combined with the observation that the mouse:__entity__ c-Rel:__entity__ and:__entity__ human:__entity__ RelA:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ also interact with TBP:__entity__ and TFIIB:__entity__ in vitro , these results suggest that association with basal:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factors:__entity__ is important for the transcriptional activities of Rel:__entity__ family:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ .
p21ras:__entity__ and calcineurin synergize to regulate the nuclear:__entity__ factor:__entity__ of activated T cells .
In T lymphocytes , triggering of the T:__entity__ cell:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ ( TCR:__entity__ ) induces several signaling cascades which ultimately synergize to induce the activity of the nuclear:__entity__ factor:__entity__ of activated T cells ( NFAT ) , a DNA:__entity__ binding:__entity__ complex:__entity__ critical to the inducibility and T cell specificity of the T:__entity__ cell:__entity__ growth:__entity__ factor:__entity__ interleukin:__entity__ 2:__entity__ .
One immediate consequence of T cell activation via the TCR:__entity__ is an increase in cytosolic calcium .
Calcium signals are important for NFAT induction , and recent studies have identified calcineurin:__entity__ , a calcium-calmodulin:__entity__ dependent:__entity__ serine-threonine:__entity__ phosphatase:__entity__ , as a prominent component of the calcium signaling pathway in T cells .
A second important molecule in TCR signal transduction is the guanine:__entity__ nucleotide:__entity__ binding:__entity__ protein:__entity__ , p21ras:__entity__ , which is coupled to the TCR:__entity__ by a protein:__entity__ tyrosine:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ dependent mechanism .
The experiments presented here show that expression by transfection of mutationally activated calcineurin:__entity__ or activated p21ras:__entity__ alone is insufficient for NFAT transactivation .
However , coexpression of the activated calcineurin with activated p21ras could mimic TCR signals in NFAT induction .
These data identify calcineurin:__entity__ and p21ras:__entity__ as cooperative partners in T cell activation .
Expression of the chicken:__entity__ GATA:__entity__ factor:__entity__ family:__entity__ during early erythroid development and differentiation .
The DNA motif WGATAR has been identified within transcriptional:__entity__ regulatory:__entity__ domains:__entity__ of globin:__entity__ and other erythroid-specific:__entity__ genes:__entity__ and the activator:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ that bind to this regulatory:__entity__ element:__entity__ , the GATA:__entity__ factors:__entity__ , belong to a multi-gene:__entity__ family:__entity__ that is expressed in chicken erythroid cells .
Here we show that , as in chickens , multiple members of the GATA:__entity__ factor:__entity__ family:__entity__ are expressed in human and murine erythroid cells .
During the early stages of chicken embryogenesis ( well before blood island formation ) , each of the GATA:__entity__ family:__entity__ members:__entity__ is transcribed with a unique temporal and spatial pattern .
In the primitive erythroid lineage , transcription of the embryonic:__entity__ epsilon-globin:__entity__ gene:__entity__ parallels GATA-1 expression while the switch to beta-globin transcription in definitive erythroid cells is directly preceded by a pronounced increase in GATA-3:__entity__ accumulation .
The timing and pattern of expression of these different mRNAs:__entity__ during avian erythroid development and differentiation suggests that temporally regulated changes in GATA:__entity__ factor:__entity__ expression are required for vertebrate hematopoiesis .
Molecular regulation of human:__entity__ interleukin:__entity__ 2:__entity__ and T-cell function by interleukin:__entity__ 4:__entity__ .
Distinct functional T-cell subsets , differing in the patterns of lymphokines:__entity__ produced , regulate cell-mediated and humoral immune responses .
The two major types and their principal products , interleukin:__entity__ 4:__entity__ and interferon:__entity__ gamma:__entity__ ( IL-4:__entity__ and IFN-gamma:__entity__ ) , are reciprocally negatively interactive .
To analyze the molecular mechanism of IL-4-mediated suppression of cell-mediated immunity we studied its effects on expression of interleukin:__entity__ 2:__entity__ ( IL-2:__entity__ ) and IFN-gamma:__entity__ .
IL-4:__entity__ pretreatment of Jurkat cells prior to stimulation resulted in a decrease in transcription of the IL2:__entity__ gene:__entity__ .
IL-4:__entity__ suppressed IL-2 and IFN-gamma mRNA levels in primary human T cells , and addition of anti-CD28:__entity__ antibodies:__entity__ relieved this suppression .
Using enhancer-reporter:__entity__ constructs:__entity__ , IL-4:__entity__ specifically down-regulated the NFIL-2B:__entity__ element:__entity__ .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using a DNA oligomer containing the NFIL-2B:__entity__ binding:__entity__ site:__entity__ indicated that IL-4:__entity__ inhibited the NFIL-2B:__entity__ complex:__entity__ and that the NFIL-2B:__entity__ DNA:__entity__ binding:__entity__ factor:__entity__ is distinct from AP-:__entity__ 1 .
These results suggest that IL-4:__entity__ may regulate development and function of T-cell subsets involved in cell-mediated immunity in part by inhibiting:__entity__ factors:__entity__ required for transcription of the IL2:__entity__ gene:__entity__
Immunochemical differences between glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ from corticoid-sensitive and -resistant malignant lymphocytes .
We have explored the possibility of using antibodies:__entity__ against purified rat liver glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ to study the immunochemical properties of glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ from murine and human malignant lymphocytes .
For this purpose , purified:__entity__ immune:__entity__ immunoglobulin:__entity__ G:__entity__ was covalently linked to Sepharose:__entity__ CL-4B:__entity__ .
We then examined the ability of the affinity gel to recognize cytosolic:__entity__ [:__entity__ 3H:__entity__ ]:__entity__ triamcinolone:__entity__ acetonide-receptor:__entity__ complexes:__entity__ from the corticoid-sensitive ( CS ) and -resistant strains of mouse lymphoma P1798 , from CS lymphocytes of patients with chronic lymphatic leukemia , and from a CS clone of human leukemic lymphoblasts in tissue culture ( CH6 ) .
Mouse thymus was used as a source of glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ from normal CS lymphocytes .
Whereas the immunoaffinity column retained 70 to 84 % of the 58- to 62-A ( Stokes radius ) [:__entity__ 3H:__entity__ ]:__entity__ triamcinolone:__entity__ acetonide-receptor:__entity__ complexes:__entity__ characteristic of the CS mouse and human lymphocytes , it failed to recognize the 27- to 28-A ( Stokes radius ) glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ present in corticoid-resistant mouse lymphoma P1798 cells .
Therefore , under appropriate experimental conditions , it was possible to demonstrate cross-reactivity between the antiserum against rat:__entity__ liver:__entity__ glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ and the 58- to 62-A ( Stokes radius ) glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ from species as diverse as mouse and humans .
Heterogeneity of the in vitro responses to glucocorticoids in acute leukemia .
In leukocyte population freshly isolated from the blood of 26 patients with acute leukemia , we have measured several parameters including glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ , nucleoside incorporation , percentage of cells in S phase , and steroid-induced cell lysis .
In addition , in some cases , the short-term response to steroid therapy was determined .
Although , in all the patients studied , leukocytes were found to contain glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ , we failed to demonstrate any correlation between the level of binding sites and the in vitro or in vivo response to glucocorticoids .
This absence of correlation could be in part explained by the marked heterogeneity of the steroid response demonstrated in leukocyte subpopulations .
It appears , however , that the degree of steroid action in vitro as well as the extent of spontaneous and dexamethasone-induced cell death may be related to the number of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle .
Glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ in cytosol and nuclear extract of human leukocytes .
Cortisol binding by cytosol and 0.4 M KCl extract of the nuclear fraction of human leukocytes were studied by gel chromatography and ion exchange filtration on DEAE cellulose .
The cytoplasmic:__entity__ cortisol:__entity__ binding:__entity__ protein:__entity__ has a molecular weight 95 000 and the soluble:__entity__ nuclear:__entity__ binding:__entity__ protein:__entity__ 50 000 .
The absence of the uptake of radioactive cortisol by isolated nuclei and the apparent requirement of the cytosol for glucocorticoid specific binding in nuclear receptor sites was observed .
The association constant characterising the binding of cortisol to cytosol was KA = 3.5 . 10 ( 9 ) l/mol .
Corticosteroid-induced lymphopenia , immunosuppression , and body defense .
The apparent paradox of heightened adrenal corticosteroid levels associated with reduction in the competence of the body 's defensive apparatus to cope with exposure to new microbial:__entity__ antigens:__entity__ is considered .
The question is asked how this lowered defensive capability , which occurs in the face of a threat to body integrity , is consistent with Cannon 's principals of the `` wisdom of the body. ''
The suggestion is offered that the immunologic response to self-antigens:__entity__ exposed by disease or trauma may be suppressed by corticosteroid to offset the likelihood of autoimmune attack .
Protein:__entity__ tyrosine:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ activation is required for lipopolysaccharide induction of cytokines:__entity__ in human blood monocytes .
Bacterial LPS induce production of cytokines:__entity__ such as IL-1:__entity__ , IL-6:__entity__ , and TNF:__entity__ in mononuclear phagocytes , and this represents a central component in the pathogenesis of septic shock syndrome .
However , the mechanisms by which LPS activates these cells to express cytokines:__entity__ are not completely characterized .
The present study addressed the role of different protein:__entity__ kinases:__entity__ in the LPS induction of cytokines:__entity__ .
It is shown that LPS induced a 12- to 16-fold increase in IL-1 beta , IL-6 , and TNF-alpha mRNA levels , and this was completely or more than 80 % blocked by the protein tyrosine kinase specific inhibitors herbimycin A and genistein at the concentrations of 1.7 and 37 microM , respectively .
Protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ C:__entity__ inhibition by staurosporine reduced LPS induction of TNF-alpha:__entity__ , whereas it had no effects on IL-6:__entity__ and IL-1 beta .
Inhibition of protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ A:__entity__ by H89 reduced IL-6:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ levels but did not detectably change IL-1 beta or TNF-alpha mRNA levels .
In contrast , LPS did not increase leukemia:__entity__ inhibitory:__entity__ factor:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ , which was constitutively expressed and not significantly reduced by these inhibitors .
In addition to cytokine:__entity__ mRNA:__entity__ levels , LPS-induced IL-6 protein synthesis and IL-6 bioactivity were also reduced to baseline levels by the PTK inhibitors herbimycin A and genistein .
Both PTK inhibitors also reduced the LPS activation of nuclear:__entity__ factor-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ ( NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ ) , which is a transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ involved in the expression of cytokine:__entity__ genes:__entity__ such as IL-6:__entity__ and TNF-alpha:__entity__ .
The activation of NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ was also reduced by H89 , whereas staurosporine had no effect on this response .
In summary , these findings suggest that protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ C:__entity__ and protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ A:__entity__ appear to have selective effects in the LPS induction of cytokines:__entity__ , whereas PTK:__entity__ is required for LPS induction of a broad spectrum of cytokines:__entity__ and NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ activation in monocytes .
In vivo control of NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ activation by I:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ .
The transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ is stored in the cytoplasm in complexes with the inhibitor:__entity__ protein:__entity__ I:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ .
It has been shown in vitro that dissociation of I:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ from these complexes results in active:__entity__ NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ .
In this report we show that lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -induced activation of B or pre-B cells results in loss of I:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ from NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ complexes:__entity__ in vivo .
Many liberated NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ dimers:__entity__ reached the nucleus , where increased c-rel:__entity__ , p65 and p50 were detected by immunoblotting and by DNA binding assays .
Some liberated:__entity__ dimers:__entity__ were retained in the cytoplasm , however , through binding to newly synthesized I:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ , a finding which strongly suggests ( i ) that the LPS-induced signal causes dissociation of complexes rather than preventing their association and ( ii ) that dissociation results from modification of I:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ and not of c-rel:__entity__ or p65:__entity__ .
No effect of LPS treatment was detected on p105:__entity__ or p100:__entity__ , which also retain rel:__entity__ family:__entity__ members:__entity__ in the cytoplasm .
Quite unexpectedly , we also found that in unstimulated cells there is a constant ongoing process of degradation and replacement of complexed:__entity__ I:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ .
We propose that this turnover results in the low level of active:__entity__ NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ presumably necessary even in the unstimulated cell , and that the high rate of synthesis of I:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ provides the ability to turn off NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ activity rapidly as soon as the activating signal ceases .
Identification of a killer:__entity__ cell-specific:__entity__ regulatory:__entity__ element:__entity__ of the mouse:__entity__ perforin:__entity__ gene:__entity__ : an Ets-binding site-homologous motif that interacts with Ets-related:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ .
The gene encoding the cytolytic:__entity__ protein:__entity__ perforin:__entity__ is selectively expressed by activated killer lymphocytes .
To understand the mechanisms underlying the cell-type-specific expression of this gene , we have characterized the regulatory functions and the DNA-protein interactions of the 5'-flanking:__entity__ region:__entity__ of the mouse:__entity__ perforin:__entity__ gene:__entity__ ( Pfp:__entity__ ) .
A region extending from residues:__entity__ +62:__entity__ through:__entity__ -141:__entity__ , which possesses the essential promoter activity , and regions further upstream , which are able to either enhance or suppress gene expression , were identified .
The region between residues:__entity__ -411:__entity__ and:__entity__ -566:__entity__ was chosen for further characterization , since it contains an enhancer-like activity .
We have identified a 32-mer sequence ( residues:__entity__ -491:__entity__ to:__entity__ -522:__entity__ ) which appeared to be capable of enhancing gene expression in a killer cell-specific manner .
Within this segment , a 9-mer motif ( 5'-ACAGGAAGT-3 ' , residues:__entity__ -505:__entity__ to:__entity__ -497:__entity__ ; designated NF-P motif ) , which is highly homologous to the Ets:__entity__ proto-oncoprotein-binding:__entity__ site:__entity__ , was found to interact with two proteins , NF-P1:__entity__ and NF-P2:__entity__ .
NF-P2:__entity__ appears to be induced by reagents known to up-regulate the perforin message level and is present exclusively in killer cells .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and UV cross-linking experiments revealed that NF-P1:__entity__ and NF-P2:__entity__ may possess common DNA-binding:__entity__ subunits:__entity__ .
However , the larger native molecular mass of NF-P1:__entity__ suggests that NF-P1:__entity__ contains an additional non-DNA-binding:__entity__ subunit:__entity__ ( s ) .
In view of the homology between the NF-P:__entity__ motif:__entity__ and other Ets:__entity__ proto-oncoprotein-binding:__entity__ sites:__entity__ , it is postulated that NF-P1:__entity__ and NF-P2:__entity__ belong to the Ets:__entity__ protein:__entity__ family:__entity__ .
Results obtained from the binding competition assay , nevertheless , suggest that NF-P1:__entity__ and NF-P2:__entity__ are related to but distinct from Ets:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ , e.g. , Ets-1:__entity__ , Ets-2:__entity__ , and NF-AT/Elf-1:__entity__ , known to be expressed in T cells .
The role of NF-kappa:__entity__ B1:__entity__ (:__entity__ p50/p105:__entity__ ):__entity__ gene:__entity__ expression in activation of human blood T-lymphocytes via CD2:__entity__ and:__entity__ CD28:__entity__ adhesion:__entity__ molecules:__entity__ .
Stimulation of primary human T-lymphocytes via CD2:__entity__ and:__entity__ CD28:__entity__ adhesion:__entity__ molecules:__entity__ induces a long-lasting proliferation ( > 3 weeks ) .
This potent activation does not require accessory cells , such as monocytes , but depends on persistent interleukin:__entity__ 2:__entity__ ( IL-2:__entity__ ) secretion and receptivity , which is associated with high and prolonged expression of the inducible CD25/IL-2:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ (:__entity__ IL-2R:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ ):__entity__ chain:__entity__ gene:__entity__ .
The transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ participates in the regulation of both IL-2:__entity__ and:__entity__ IL-2R:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ genes:__entity__ , as well as multiple:__entity__ cellular:__entity__ genes:__entity__ involved in T-cell proliferation .
To evaluate the role of NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ in human peripheral blood T-lymphocytes , we previously analyzed the activation of NF-kappa:__entity__ B-related:__entity__ complexes:__entity__ in response to CD2+CD28 costimulation .
We demonstrated a long-term induction of p50/p65:__entity__ heterodimer:__entity__ , a putative:__entity__ p65/c-Rel:__entity__ heterodimer:__entity__ , and a constitutive nuclear expression of KBF1/p50:__entity__ homodimers:__entity__ .:__entity__
As the role of p50:__entity__ remains unclear , we focused our present study on NF-kappa:__entity__ B1:__entity__ ( p50/p105:__entity__ ) gene regulation .
Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and Western and Northern blot analyses , we studied NF-kappa:__entity__ B1:__entity__ gene:__entity__ expression during T-cell stimulation via CD2+CD28:__entity__ .
We observed a transient 4- to 5-fold increase of NF-kappa B1 gene expression at both the mRNA and protein levels , lasting for at least 24 h .
p50 DNA-binding activity apparently stays highly controlled when p105 expression is enhanced by a physiological stimulus of peripheral blood T-cells .
Partial inhibition of p50 and p105 expression by NF-kappa:__entity__ B1:__entity__ antisense oligonucleotides significantly reduced T-cell proliferation and CD25/IL-2R:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ cell surface expression .
( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
Vitamin:__entity__ D:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ quantitation in human blood mononuclear cells in health and disease .
Vitamin:__entity__ D:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ ( VDR ) concentration was quantitated in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) from patients with absorptive hypercalciuria ( AH ) and patients with high 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 due to acquired or transient disease states and the results compared to those in normal subjects .
VDR concentration in resting cells was not different between the three groups and represented constitutive receptor expression of monocytes .
Following activation with phytohemagglutinin:__entity__ , patients with hypercalcitriolemia demonstrated significantly greater VDR concentrations .
Patients with AH demonstrated a normal value for the group , but 6 patients had significantly greater concentrations of VDR:__entity__ despite normal plasma 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 in four of the patients .
Proliferation , as assessed from [ 3H ] thymidine incorporation was inversely correlated with serum 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 and was significant ( R = -0.299 , p = 0.048 ) .
Taken together , the results suggest that PBMC provide a useful system for studying VDR:__entity__ status in transient or acquired states of hypercalcitriolemia .
Furthermore , the studies in patients with absorptive hypercalciuria disclosed it to be a heterogeneous disorder , characterized by both vitamin D-dependent and D-independent forms of receptor up-regulation .
Reactive oxygen intermediates activate NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ in a tyrosine kinase-dependent mechanism and in combination with vanadate activate the p56lck:__entity__ and:__entity__ p59fyn:__entity__ tyrosine:__entity__ kinases:__entity__ in human lymphocytes .
We have previously observed that ionizing radiation induces tyrosine phosphorylation in human B-lymphocyte precursors by stimulation of unidentified tyrosine:__entity__ kinases:__entity__ and this phosphorylation is substantially augmented by vanadate .
Ionizing radiation generates reactive oxygen intermediates ( ROI ) .
Because H2O2 is a potent ROI generator that readily crosses the plasma membrane , we used H2O2 to examine the effects of ROI on signal transduction .
We now provide evidence that the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A and the free radical scavenger N-acetyl-cysteine inhibit both radiation-induced and H2O2-induced activation of NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ , indicating that activation triggered by ROI is dependent on tyrosine kinase activity .
H2O2 was found to stimulate Ins-1:__entity__ ,:__entity__ 4:__entity__ ,:__entity__ 5-P3:__entity__ production in a tyrosine kinase-dependent manner and to induce calcium signals that were greatly augmented by vanadate .
The synergistic induction of tyrosine phosphorylation by H2O2 plus vanadate included physiologically relevant proteins such as PLC:__entity__ gamma:__entity__ 1:__entity__ .
Although treatment of cells with H2O2 alone did not affect the activity of src:__entity__ family:__entity__ kinases:__entity__ , treatment with H2O2 plus vanadate led to activation of the p56lck:__entity__ and:__entity__ p59fyn:__entity__ tyrosine:__entity__ kinases:__entity__ .
The combined inhibition of phosphatases:__entity__ and activation of kinases:__entity__ provides a potent mechanism for the synergistic effects of H2O2 plus vanadate .
Induction of tyrosine phosphorylation by ROI may thus lead to many of the pleiotropic effects of ROI in lymphoid cells , including downstream activation of PLC:__entity__ gamma:__entity__ 1:__entity__ and NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__
Influence of sex:__entity__ hormone:__entity__ binding:__entity__ globulin:__entity__ and serum:__entity__ albumin:__entity__ on the conversion of androstenedione to testosterone by human erythrocytes .
The influence of human:__entity__ serum:__entity__ albumin:__entity__ and sex:__entity__ hormone:__entity__ binding:__entity__ globulin:__entity__ ( SHBG:__entity__ ) on the enzymic conversion of androstenedione to testosterone in human erythrocytes was investigated in vitro .
Total plasma and albumin:__entity__ delayed the conversion rate of androstenedione , while SHBG:__entity__ increased it markedly .
The effect of SHBG:__entity__ was largely abolished by heating to 60 degrees C for 1 h and by saturating its binding sites by DHT .
The effect of both proteins was found to be related to their concentration .
It appears that the binding sites of albumin:__entity__ provide a mechanism for retarding androstenedione uptake by the erythrocytes and that the high binding affinity of SHBG:__entity__ for testosterone facilitates the diffusion of this steroid out of the cell and thus , displaces the chemical equilibrium within the cell .
Glucocorticoids and lymphocytes .
I .
Increased glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ levels in antigen-stimulated lymphocytes .
Recently a 2- to 3-fold increase in the number of glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ in human peripheral lymphocytes has been noted after in vitro mitogen stimulation .
Here , we extend these observations to in vivo immunization .
After unilateral immunization of adrenalectomized male rats , a 50 % increase in glucocorticoid receptor sites per cell , determined by binding of dexamethasone , was observed in cell suspensions of homolateral lymph nodes over those from the contralateral nonimmunized side of the same animal .
The association constant for dexamethasone was similar in both groups , as was the stereospecificity for various steroids , the time course of cytoplasmic and nuclear association , and cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation .
Despite a 50 % increase in the number of glucocorticoid receptor sites per cell , the cells from the homolateral and controlateral lymph nodes were equally sensitive to the inhibitory effects of dexamethasone , as determined by measurements of the incorporation of radiolabeled precursors of protein , RNA , and DNA , or measurements of in vitro cell survival .
Glucocorticoid receptors and actions in rat thymocytes and immunologically stimulated human peripheral lymphocytes .
After reviewing briefly our earlier studies on glucocorticoid receptors and mechanisms in thymus cells , we have outlined results from the following two areas of current interest in our laboratories : the `` life-cycle '' of glucocorticoid receptors and complexes in thymus cells , and the levels of glucocorticoid receptors and sensitivity in immunologically stimulated human peripheral lymphocytes .
Several of our results on energetics and kinetics of hormone binding to glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptors:__entity__ in rat thymus cells seem to require extension of the simplest model of hormone-receptor transformations in intact cells .
ATP-depletion experiments suggest the existence of a nonbinding form of the receptor ; `` chase '' experiments suggest reaction of hormone directly with nuclear-bound receptor ; experiments on depletion and replenishment of cytoplasmic:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ using cortisol and dexamethasone suggest the existence of at least two subpopulations of nuclear-bound:__entity__ hormone-receptor:__entity__ complex:__entity__ .
We have found that mitogen or immunologic stimulation of human peripheral lymphocytes in culture leads within 24 h or so to a striking increase in the number of glucocorticoid:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ sites per cell .
We believe this increase may be due to partial synchronization of the cell population in a phase of the cell cycle in which receptor content is high .
Contrary to the widely held view that mitogen-stimulated cells become insensitive to glucocorticoids , our experiments show that with respect to inhibition of thymidine and uridine incorporation and glucose uptake , the cells are highly sensitive to dexamethasone at 24 , 48 , and 72 h after stimulation with concanavalin:__entity__ A:__entity__ .
Nuclear glucocorticoid binding in chronic lymphatic leukemia lymphocytes .
A reliable procedure is described for isolating 3H-triamcinolone:__entity__ acetonide:__entity__ (:__entity__ 3H-TA:__entity__ ):__entity__ receptor:__entity__ complexes:__entity__ from purified chronic lymphatic leukemia ( CLL ) lymphocyte nuclei , based on the use of carbobenzoxy-L-phenylalanine ( CBZ-L-phe ) to prevent breakdown of hormone-receptor:__entity__ complexes:__entity__ during extraction of nuclei with 0.6M KCl .
Using this method , specific nuclear glucocorticoid binding was demonstrated in 14/14 patients with untreated CLL .
No correlation was found between levels of nuclear-associated 3H-TA and peripheral white blood cell count or rosetting ability of circulating lymphocytes .
Multiple closely-linked NFAT/octamer:__entity__ and HMG:__entity__ I:__entity__ (:__entity__ Y:__entity__ ):__entity__ binding:__entity__ sites:__entity__ are part of the interleukin-4 promoter .
We show here that the immediate:__entity__ upstream:__entity__ region:__entity__ ( from position -12 to -270 ) of the murine:__entity__ interleukin:__entity__ 4:__entity__ (:__entity__ Il-4:__entity__ ):__entity__ gene:__entity__ harbors a strong cell-type specific transcriptional:__entity__ enhancer:__entity__ .
In T lymphoma cells , the activity of the Il-4:__entity__ promoter/enhancer:__entity__ is stimulated by phorbol esters , Ca++ ionophores and agonists of protein:__entity__ kinase:__entity__ A:__entity__ and inhibited by low doses of the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A .
The Il-4:__entity__ promoter/enhancer:__entity__ is transcriptionally inactive in B lymphoma cells and HeLa cells .
DNase I footprint protection experiments revealed six sites of the Il-4:__entity__ promoter/enhancer:__entity__ to be bound by nuclear:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ from lymphoid and myeloid cells .
Among them are four purine boxes which have been described to be important sequence motifs of the Il-2:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ .
They contain the motif GGAAA and are recognized by the inducible:__entity__ and:__entity__ cyclosporin:__entity__ A-sensitive:__entity__ transcription:__entity__ factor:__entity__ NFAT-1:__entity__ .
Three of the Il-4:__entity__ NFAT-1:__entity__ sites:__entity__ are closely linked to weak binding sites of Octamer:__entity__ factors:__entity__ .
Several purine boxes and an AT-rich:__entity__ protein-binding:__entity__ site:__entity__ of the Il-4 promoter are also recognized by the high:__entity__ mobility:__entity__ group:__entity__ protein:__entity__ HMG:__entity__ I:__entity__ (:__entity__ Y:__entity__ ) .
Whereas the binding of NFAT-1:__entity__ and Octamer:__entity__ factors:__entity__ enhance the activity of the Il-4:__entity__ promoter:__entity__ , the binding of HMG I ( Y ) suppresses its activity and , therefore , appears to be involved in the suppression of Il-4:__entity__ transcription in resting T lymphocytes .
Reversibility of the differentiated state in somatic cells .
Analysis of de novo gene activation in multinucleated heterokaryons has shown that the differentiated state , although stable , is not irreversible , and can be reprogrammed in the presence of appropriate combinations of trans-acting:__entity__ regulatory:__entity__ molecules:__entity__ .
These properties have been exploited to design strategies for identifying novel regulators of cellular differentiation .
Phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis activates NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ and increases human immunodeficiency virus replication in human monocytes and T lymphocytes .
We have tested whether breakdown of phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) initiated by exogenous addition of a PC-specific:__entity__ phospholipase:__entity__ C:__entity__ ( PC-PLC:__entity__ ) from Bacillus cereus or by endogenous overexpression of PC-PLC:__entity__ induces functional activation of NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ and increases human:__entity__ immunodeficiency:__entity__ virus:__entity__ (:__entity__ HIV:__entity__ ):__entity__ enhancer:__entity__ activity .
PC-PLC-activated hydrolysis of PC was found to induce bona fide p50/p65:__entity__ NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ binding activity in three different cell lines of human or murine origin .
No significant changes in the turnover of other cellular phospholipids were detected in PC-PLC-treated cells .
Induction of NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ by PC-PLC:__entity__ did not depend on de novo synthesis of proteins or autocrine secretion of either tumor:__entity__ necrosis:__entity__ factor:__entity__ or interleukin:__entity__ 1:__entity__ .
In human monocytic and lymphoblastoid T-cell lines , induction of NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ by PC-PLC:__entity__ resulted in clear induction of luciferase:__entity__ expression vectors placed under the control of synthetic:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ enhancers:__entity__ or wild type , but not kappa B-mutated , HIV:__entity__ long:__entity__ terminal:__entity__ repeat:__entity__ constructs:__entity__ .
HIV replication was increased by PC-PLC:__entity__ in chronically infected monocytes and T lymphocytes .
NF-kappa B activation promoted by addition of exogenous:__entity__ PC-PLC:__entity__ correlated with an intense production of diacylglycerol .
However , addition of a phosphatidylinositol-specific:__entity__ PLC:__entity__ from B.cereus also induced diacylglycerol but did not activate kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ enhancer-directed:__entity__ vectors:__entity__ .
PC-PLC-induced NF-kappa B activation could not be blocked by a specific inhibitor of phorbol:__entity__ ester-inducible:__entity__ protein:__entity__ kinases:__entity__ C:__entity__ .
These results indicate that a cellular transduction pathway , dependent on specific PC breakdown , is functional in T lymphocytes and monocytes and may be used by various transmembrane receptors to activate HIV transcription through NF-kappa B-dependent induction of the HIV:__entity__ enhancer:__entity__ .
Novel mechanism for inhibition of human T cells by glucocorticoids .
Glucocorticoids inhibit signal transduction through IL-2:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ .
Interaction of IL-2:__entity__ with its high:__entity__ affinity:__entity__ membrane:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ complex:__entity__ ( IL-2R:__entity__ ) present on activated T lymphocytes induces cell proliferation and mediates effector functions .
Glucocorticoids inhibit IL-2:__entity__ production by inhibiting TCR-mediated signal transduction .
We asked whether they also inhibit the action of IL-2:__entity__ by inhibiting signal transduction through IL-2R:__entity__ .
Human peripheral blood T cells , stimulated with PMA for 48 h ( PMA blasts ) , were incubated with IL-2:__entity__ in the presence of incremental dosages of dexamethasone ( Dex ; 10 ( -5 ) -10 ( -9 ) M ) .
Dex inhibited the IL-2-dependent proliferation of PMA blasts in a dose-dependent fashion ( IC50 , 5 x 10 ( -8 ) M ) .
Cell surface expression of IL-2R:__entity__ alpha-:__entity__ and:__entity__ beta-chains:__entity__ as determined by immunofluorescence analysis was not affected by Dex .
In addition , Scatchard plot analysis of 125I-labeled:__entity__ IL-2:__entity__ showed that Dex did not affect the binding of IL-2:__entity__ , thus suggesting that inhibition is due to a postreceptor effect .
Inhibition of T cell proliferation by Dex was associated with decreased IL-2-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of several intracellular:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ and decreased phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma:__entity__ gene:__entity__ product:__entity__ Rb:__entity__ , a protein essential for controlling the progression of cells through the cell cycle .
IL-2-dependent IL-2R alpha expression in PMA blasts and NF-kB:__entity__ induction in resting human T cells were also inhibited by Dex .
These results demonstrate that glucocorticoids inhibit preactivated T cells by down-regulating signal transduction through IL-2R:__entity__ .
Chronic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection stimulates distinct NF-kappa B/rel DNA binding activities in myelomonoblastic cells .
The relationship between human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection and the induction of NF-kappa B binding activity was examined in a myeloid cell model of HIV-1 infection derived from the PLB-985 cell line .
Chronic infection of PLB-985 cells led to increased monocyte-specific surface marker expression , increased c-fms gene transcription , and morphological alterations consistent with differentiation along the monocytic pathway .
PLB-IIIB cells displayed a constitutive NF-kappa B-like binding activity that was distinct from that induced by tumor:__entity__ necrosis:__entity__ factor:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment of the parental PLB-985 cell line .
This unique DNA binding activity consisted of proteins of 70:__entity__ ,:__entity__ 90:__entity__ ,:__entity__ and:__entity__ 100:__entity__ kDa:__entity__ with a high degree of binding specificity for the NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ site:__entity__ within the PRDII:__entity__ domain:__entity__ of beta:__entity__ interferon:__entity__ .
In this report , we characterize the nature of these proteins and demonstrate that binding of these proteins is also induced following Sendai paramyxovirus infection .
The 70-kDa:__entity__ protein:__entity__ corresponds to the NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ RelA:__entity__ (:__entity__ p65:__entity__ ):__entity__ subunit:__entity__ , which is activated in response to an acute paramyxovirus infection or a chronic HIV-1 infection .
Virus infection does not appear to alter the amount of RelA:__entity__ ( p65:__entity__ ) or NFKB1:__entity__ ( p50:__entity__ ) but rather affects the capacity of I:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ alpha:__entity__ to sequester RelA:__entity__ (:__entity__ p65:__entity__ ):__entity__ , therefore leading to constitutive levels of RelA DNA binding activity and to increased levels of NF-kappa B-dependent gene activity .
The virally induced 90-:__entity__ to:__entity__ 100-kDa:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ have a distinct binding specificity for the PRDII:__entity__ domain:__entity__ and an AT-rich:__entity__ sequence:__entity__ but do not cross-react with NF-kappa B subunit-specific antisera directed against NFKB1:__entity__ ( p105:__entity__ or p50:__entity__ ) , NFKB2:__entity__ ( p100:__entity__ or p52:__entity__ ) , RelA:__entity__ ( p65:__entity__ ) , or c-rel:__entity__ .
DNA binding of the 90-:__entity__ to:__entity__ 100-kDa:__entity__ proteins:__entity__ was not inhibited by recombinant:__entity__ I:__entity__ kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ alpha/MAD-3:__entity__ and was resistant to tryptic digestion , suggesting that these proteins may not be NF-kappa:__entity__ B:__entity__ related:__entity__ .
Transient cotransfection experiments demonstrated that RelA and NFKB1 expression maximally stimulated HIV-1:__entity__ LTR-:__entity__ and:__entity__ NF-kappa:__entity__ B-dependent:__entity__ reporter:__entity__ genes:__entity__ ; differences in NF-kappa B-like binding activity were also reflected in higher constitutive levels of NF-kappa B-regulated gene expression in HIV-1-infected myeloid cells .
Presence of estrogen-binding sites on macrophage-like synoviocytes and CD8+ , CD29+ , CD45RO+ T lymphocytes in normal and rheumatoid synovium .
OBJECTIVE .
To study the presence of estrogen-binding sites ( EBS ) in the synovial tissues of male and female patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) and in age- and sex-matched healthy controls .
METHODS .
Both type 1 ( high affinity , low binding capacity ) and type 2 ( reduced affinity , higher binding capacity ) EBS were investigated in both soluble and nuclear fractions of homogenized synovial tissue samples by a dextran-coated charcoal method .
To determine what type of synovial cell was positive for EBS , cryosections of synovial tissues were immunostained with a specific monoclonal:__entity__ anti-estrogen:__entity__ receptor:__entity__ antibody:__entity__ ( anti-ER:__entity__ MAb:__entity__ ) using both immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase techniques .
Double immunostaining with the anti-ER:__entity__ MAb:__entity__ and with specific:__entity__ MAb:__entity__ to detect different macrophage:__entity__ antigens:__entity__ ( Ber-MAC3:__entity__ , MAC387:__entity__ , CD68:__entity__ ) and CD8+ T cell subsets ( CD29+ , CD45RO+ and CD29- , CD45RO- ) was performed .
RESULTS .
Higher affinity EBS were found mostly in nuclear cell fractions of either RA or control synovial tissues ( 28 of the 33 ) .
These EBS were present to a lesser extent in soluble cell fractions ( 11 of the 33 ) .
Immunostaining showed the estrogen receptor-positive cells to be the macrophage-like synoviocytes and the CD8+ , CD29+ T cells both in RA and in control synovial tissues .
Higher nuclear content of EBS was consistent with more intense nuclear staining of synoviocytes and T cells .
CONCLUSION .
It is conceivable that the immunomodulatory activity exerted by estrogens is at least partly mediated through their interaction with EBS that are present on macrophage-like synoviocytes , functioning as antigen-processing and antigen-presenting cells , and on antigen-experienced ( memory ) CD8+ T lymphocytes ( CD29+ , CD45RO+
