Streptococcus:__entity__ ursoris:__entity__ sp:__entity__ .:__entity__ nov:__entity__ .:__entity__ , isolated from the oral cavities of bears .
Three Gram - positive , catalase - negative , coccus - shaped organisms were isolated from the oral cavities of bears .
The isolates were tentatively identified as a streptococcal species based on the results of biochemical tests .
Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies confirmed that the organisms were members of the genus Streptococcus , but they did not correspond to any recognized species of the genus .
The nearest phylogenetic relative of the new isolates was Streptococcus:__entity__ ratti:__entity__ ATCC:__entity__ 19645:__entity__ ( T ) ( 98 . 6 % ) , however , DNA - DNA hybridization analysis showed that the isolates displayed less than 15 % DNA - DNA relatedness with the type strain of S:__entity__ .:__entity__ ratti:__entity__ .
Colonies of the novel strains grown on mitis salivarius agar showed an extracellular polysaccharide - producing colony morphology .
Based on phenotypic and phylogenetic evidence , it is proposed that the novel isolates are classified in the genus Streptococcus as Streptococcus:__entity__ ursoris:__entity__ sp:__entity__ .:__entity__ nov:__entity__ .:__entity__
The type strain of S:__entity__ .:__entity__ ursoris:__entity__ is NUM:__entity__ 1615:__entity__ (:__entity__ T:__entity__ ):__entity__ ( = JCM 16316 ( T ) = DSM 22768 ( T ) ) .
Larkinella:__entity__ bovis:__entity__ sp . nov . , isolated from fermented bovine products , and emended descriptions of the genus Larkinella and of Larkinella:__entity__ insperata:__entity__ Vancanneyt et al .
2006 .
A novel bacterial strain , designated M2T2B15:__entity__ ( T ) , was isolated from fermented bovine products and was characterized by using a polyphasic approach .
Colonies were reddish pink and circular with entire margins .
Cells were strictly aerobic , Gram - reaction - negative , oxidase - and catalase - positive rods that lacked flagella and were motile by gliding .
Flexirubin - type pigments were absent .
16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that strain M2T2B15:__entity__ ( T ) was related most closely to Larkinella:__entity__ insperata:__entity__ LMG 22510 ( T ) ( 94 . 4 % similarity ) but shared & lt ; 87 % similarity with other members of the phylum Bacteroidetes .
The major cellular fatty acids were C ( 16 : 1 ) omega5c , iso - C ( 15 : 0 ) and iso - C ( 17 : 0 ) 3 - OH .
The polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine , phosphatidylserine , two unidentified aminophospholipids and two unidentified polar lipids .
Menaquinone 7 ( MK - 7 ) was the major respiratory quinone .
The G + C content of the DNA of strain M2T2B15:__entity__ ( T ) was 52 & amp ; emsp14 ; mol % .
The phenotypic , genotypic and phylogenetic data presented clearly indicate that strain M2T2B15:__entity__ ( T ) represents a novel species of the genus Larkinella , for which the name Larkinella:__entity__ bovis:__entity__ sp . nov .
is proposed .
The type strain is M2T2B15:__entity__ ( T ) ( = KACC 14040 ( T ) = NBRC 106324 ( T ) ) .
Emended descriptions of the genus Larkinella and of Larkinella:__entity__ insperata:__entity__ Vancanneyt et al .
2006 are also proposed .
Methanobacterium arcticum sp . nov . , a methanogenic archaeon from Holocene Arctic permafrost .
A mesophilic , non - motile , hydrogenotrophic , rod - shaped methanogen , designated M2:__entity__ (:__entity__ T:__entity__ ):__entity__ , was isolated from Holocene permafrost sediments of the Kolyma lowland in the Russian Arctic .
Cells were 3 - 6 mum long and 0 . 45 - 0 . 5 mum wide .
Strain M2:__entity__ (:__entity__ T:__entity__ ):__entity__ grew on H ( 2 ) / CO ( 2 ) and formate .
Optimum conditions for growth were 37 ^ 0C , pH 6 . 8 - 7 . 2 and 0 . 1 M NaCl .
The DNA G + C content was 38 . 1 mol % .
On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence comparison with known methanogens , strain M2:__entity__ (:__entity__ T:__entity__ ):__entity__ was affiliated with the genus Methanobacterium and was most closely related to Methanobacterium:__entity__ veterum:__entity__ MK4:__entity__ (:__entity__ T:__entity__ ):__entity__ and Methanobacterium:__entity__ bryantii:__entity__ DSM:__entity__ 863:__entity__ (:__entity__ T:__entity__ ):__entity__ ( both 99 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity ) .
However , no significant DNA - DNA relatedness was observed between strain M2:__entity__ (:__entity__ T:__entity__ ):__entity__ and these type strains .
We propose that strain M2:__entity__ (:__entity__ T:__entity__ ):__entity__ represents a novel species , with the name Methanobacterium arcticum sp . nov . , with type strain M2:__entity__ (:__entity__ T:__entity__ ):__entity__ ( = DSM 19844 ( T ) = VKM B - 2371 ( T ) ) .
Thiomonas:__entity__ islandica:__entity__ sp . nov . , a moderately thermophilic , hydrogen - and sulfur - oxidizing betaproteobacterium:__entity__ isolated from a hot spring .
A novel , hydrogen - and sulfur - oxidizing bacterium , designated strain 6C:__entity__ (:__entity__ T:__entity__ ):__entity__ , was isolated from a hot spring in Graendalur , south - western Iceland .
Cells of this organism were Gram - reaction - negative , rod - shaped and motile .
The strain grew aerobically and was capable of chemolithotrophic growth on thiosulfate and hydrogen , heterotrophic growth on pyruvate , oxalate , acetate and on glutamate in the presence of yeast extract and mixotrophic growth on several organic compounds , thiosulfate and / or hydrogen .
During growth on thiosulfate , the final product was sulfate , resulting in a drop in pH from 6 . 8 to 2 . 7 .
Heterotrophic growth on pyruvate was observed at pH 4 - 7 ( optimum pH 4 ) and 35 - 50 ^ 0C ( optimum 45 ^ 0C ) .
The DNA G + C content was 65 . 2 mol % .
As determined by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis , strain 6C:__entity__ (:__entity__ T:__entity__ ):__entity__ represents a distinct species belonging to the class Betaproteobacteria:__entity__ and is most closely related to Thiomonas:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ DSM:__entity__ 18155:__entity__ (:__entity__ T:__entity__ ):__entity__ and Thiomonas:__entity__ perometabolis:__entity__ DSM:__entity__ 18570:__entity__ (:__entity__ T:__entity__ ):__entity__ .
DNA - DNA hybridization between strain 6C:__entity__ (:__entity__ T:__entity__ ):__entity__ and Thiomonas:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ DSM:__entity__ 18155:__entity__ (:__entity__ T:__entity__ ):__entity__ and Thiomonas:__entity__ perometabolis:__entity__ DSM:__entity__ 18570:__entity__ (:__entity__ T:__entity__ ):__entity__ gave relatedness values below 32 % .
These results , together with physiological characteristics , showed that strain 6C:__entity__ (:__entity__ T:__entity__ ):__entity__ represents a novel species within the genus Thiomonas , for which the name Thiomonas:__entity__ islandica:__entity__ sp . nov .
is proposed .
The type strain is 6C:__entity__ (:__entity__ T:__entity__ ):__entity__ ( = DSM:__entity__ 21436:__entity__ (:__entity__ T:__entity__ ):__entity__ = JCM:__entity__ 16107:__entity__ (:__entity__ T:__entity__ ):__entity__ ) .
Nocardioides:__entity__ caricicola:__entity__ sp:__entity__ .:__entity__ nov:__entity__ .:__entity__ , an endophytic bacterium isolated from a halophyte , Carex:__entity__ scabrifolia:__entity__ Steud .
A Gram - staining - positive , coccoid to rod - shaped bacterium , designated strain YC6903:__entity__ ( T ) , was isolated from a halophytic plant ( Carex:__entity__ scabrifolia:__entity__ Steud . ) collected from sand dunes at Namhae Island , Korea , and its taxonomic position was investigated by using a polyphasic approach .
Strain YC6903:__entity__ ( T ) grew optimally at 30 ^ 0C and at pH 8 . 0 .
Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain YC6903:__entity__ ( T ) belongs to the genus Nocardioides in the family Nocardioidaceae .
Strain YC6903:__entity__ ( T ) was related most closely to Nocardioides:__entity__ pyridinolyticus:__entity__ OS4:__entity__ ( T ) ( 97 . 0 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity ) , Nocardioides:__entity__ dokdonensis:__entity__ FR1436:__entity__ ( T ) ( 96 . 6 % ) , Nocardioides:__entity__ aquiterrae:__entity__ GW:__entity__ -:__entity__ 9:__entity__ ( T ) ( 96 . 6 % ) and Nocardioides:__entity__ hankookensis:__entity__ DS:__entity__ -:__entity__ 30:__entity__ ( T ) ( 96 . 6 % ) .
The cell - wall peptidoglycan contained LL - diaminopimelic acid and MK - 8 ( H ( 4 ) ) was the major respiratory quinone .
The mean ( + / - SD ) level of DNA - DNA relatedness between strain YC6903:__entity__ ( T ) and N:__entity__ .:__entity__ pyridinolyticus:__entity__ OS4:__entity__ ( T ) was 53 . 5 + / - 5 . 5 % .
The predominant cellular fatty acid of strain YC6903:__entity__ ( T ) was iso - C ( 16 : 0 ) ( 28 . 9 % ) .
The DNA G + C content was 71 . 7 mol % .
Phenotypic , phylogenetic and chemotaxonomic data indicated that strain YC6903:__entity__ ( T ) represents a novel species of the genus Nocardioides , for which the name Nocardioides:__entity__ caricicola:__entity__ sp:__entity__ .:__entity__ nov:__entity__ .:__entity__
is proposed .
The type strain is YC6903:__entity__ ( T ) ( = KACC 13778 ( T ) = DSM 22177 ( T ) ) .
Radionuclide and hybrid imaging of recurrent prostate cancer .
Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in men , leading to substantial morbidity and mortality .
After definitive therapy with surgery or radiation , many patients have biochemical relapse of disease - - ie , an increase in their prostate - specific antigen level - - which often precedes clinically apparent disease by months or even years .
Therefore , imaging of the site and extent of tumour recurrence ( local , regional , distant , or a combination ) is of great interest .
Conventional morphological imaging methods showed limited accuracy for assessment of recurrent prostate cancer ; however , in recent years , functional and molecular imaging have offered the possibility of imaging molecular or cellular processes of individual tumours , often with more accuracy than morphological imaging .
Hybrid imaging modalities ( PET - CT , and single - photon emission CT [ SPECT ] - CT ) have been introduced that combine functional and morphological data and allow whole - body imaging .
Here , we review the contribution of radionuclide imaging and hybrid imaging for assessment of recurrent prostate cancer ( local vs regional vs distant disease ) .
We discuss available data on PET - CT and SPECT - CT , and provide an overview of experimental tracers and their preclinical and clinical development .
Finally , we present a perspective on the potential of future hybrid magnetic resonance - PET imaging .
Fertility - sparing surgery in patients with cervical cancer .
There are several types of fertility saving procedures that can be done in patients with cervical cancer , which differ in terms of surgical approach and extent of paracervical resection .
This review assesses oncological and pregnancy results after different procedures .
The oncological results of vaginal radical trachelectomies ( VRT ) and abdominal radical trachelectomies ( ART ) are similar for tumours less than 2 cm in size , and are now considered safe surgical procedures .
Oncological outcomes of VRT and ART in tumours larger than 2 cm are also identical , but the results cannot be considered satisfactory .
Preliminary findings of less radical procedures ( ie , deep cone and simple trachelectomy ) in patients with tumours less than 2 cm , and negative sentinel and other pelvic lymph nodes , are comparable with the results of VRT and ART .
Downstaging tumours larger than 2 cm by neoadjuvant chemotherapy is still an experimental procedure and will need multicentre cooperation to verify its oncological safety .
Pregnancy results vary statistically with the different methods .
Morphology and ultrastructure of multiple life cycle stages of the photosynthetic relative of apicomplexa , Chromera:__entity__ velia:__entity__ .
Chromera:__entity__ velia:__entity__ is a photosynthetic alga with a secondary plastid that represents the closest known photosynthetic relative of the apicomplexan parasites .
The original description of this organism was based on brownish , immotile coccoid cells , which is the predominating stage of C:__entity__ .:__entity__ velia:__entity__ in the culture .
Here we provide a detailed light and electron microscopy description of coccoid cells of C:__entity__ .:__entity__ velia:__entity__ and a previously undocumented bi - flagellated stage that is highly motile and moves in a characteristic zig - zag pattern .
Transformation from a coccoid into a flagellate stage occurs in exponentially growing cultures , and is accelerated by exposure to light .
The C:__entity__ .:__entity__ velia:__entity__ cells contain a pseudoconoid , which is likely homologous to the corresponding structure in the apical complex of Apicomplexa , cortical alveoli subtended by subpellicular microtubules , mitochondrion with tubular cristae , a micropyle , and a distinctive chromerosome , an apparently novel type of extrusion organelle .
Ultrastructural analysis of the flagellate supports its close association with colpodellids and apicomplexans and provides important insight into their evolution .
Introns , alternative splicing , spliced leader trans - splicing and differential expression of pcna and cyclin in Perkinsus:__entity__ marinus:__entity__ .
To gain understanding on the structure and regulation of growth - related genes of the parasitic alveolate Perkinsus:__entity__ marinus:__entity__ , we analyzed genes encoding proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( pcna ) and cyclins ( cyclin ) .
Comparison of the full - length cDNAs with the corresponding genomic sequences revealedtrans - splicing of the mRNAs of these genes with a conserved 21 - 22 nt spliced leader .
Over 10 copies of pcna were detected , with identical gene structures and similar nucleotide ( nt ) sequences ( 88 - 99 % ) , encoding largely identical amino acid sequences ( aa ) .
Two distinct types ofcyclin ( Pmacyclin1 and Pmacyclin2 ) were identified , with 66 - 69 % nt and 81 - 85 % aa similarities . Pmacyclin2 was organized in tandem repeats , and was alternatively spliced , giving rise to five subtypes of transcripts .
For both pcna and cyclin genes , 6 - 10 introns were found .
Quantitative RT - PCR assays showed that pcna and Pmacyclin2 expression levels were low with small variations during a 28 - h time course , whereas Pmacyclin1 transcript abundance was 10 - 100 times higher , and increased markedly during active cell division , suggesting that it is a mitoticcyclinand can be a useful growth marker for this species .
The gene structure and expression features along with phylogenetic results position this organism between dinoflagellates and apicomplexans , but its definitive affiliation among alveolates requires further studies .
Highly diverse and seasonally dynamic protist community in a pristine peat bog .
Culture - independent molecular methods based on the amplification , cloning and sequencing of small - subunit ribosomal RNA genes ( SSU rDNAs ) are powerful tools to study the diversity of microorganisms .
Despite so , the eukaryotic microbial diversity of many ecosystems , including peatlands has not yet received much attention .
We analysed the eukaryotic diversity by molecular surveys in water from the centre of a pristine Sphagnum - dominated peatland in the Jura Mountains of Switzerland during a complete seasonal cycle .
The clone libraries constructed from five different temporal samplings revealed a high diversity of protists with representatives of all major eukaryotic phyla .
In addition , four sequence types could not be assigned to any known high - level eukaryotic taxon but branched together with a rather good statistic support , raising the possibility of a novel , deep branching eukaryotic clade .
The analysis of seasonal patterns of phylotypes showed a clear change in the eukaryotic communities between the warm period ( late spring and summer ) and the cold period ( autumn and winter ) .
Chrysophytes dominated the samples in the cold period while testate amoebae ( Arcellinida and Euglyphida ) and a few other groups peaked in summer .
A few phylotypes ( such as a cryptomonad and a perkinsid ) were abundant at given sampling times and then almost disappeared , suggesting bloom - like dynamics .
Comparing potential COI and SSU rDNA barcodes for assessing the diversity and phylogenetic relationships of cyphoderiid testate amoebae ( Rhizaria : Euglyphida ) .
The mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase Subunit 1 gene ( COI ) has been promoted as an ideal & quot ; DNA barcode & quot ; for animal species and other groups of eukaryotes .
However , the utility of the COI marker for species level discrimination and for phylogenetic analyses has yet to be tested within the Rhizaria .
Accordingly , we analysed mitochondrial COI gene sequences and nuclear small subunit rDNA ( SSU ) sequences from several morphospecies of euglyphid testate amoebae ( Cercozoa , Rhizaria ) in order to evaluate the utility of these DNA markers for species discrimination and phylogenetic reconstructions .
Sequences were obtained from eleven populations belonging to six Cyphoderia morphospecies that were isolated from field samples in North America and Europe .
Mean inter - population COI sequence dissimilarities were on average 2 . 9 times greater than in the SSU , while the intra - population sequence dissimilarities were higher in the SSU ( 0 - 0 . 95 % ) than in the COI ( 0 % ) ; this suggests that the COI fragment is valuable for discriminating Cyphoderiidae isolates .
Our study also demonstrated that COI sequences are useful for inferring phylogenetic relationships among Cyphoderiidae isolates .
COI and SSU tree topologies were very similar even though the COI fragment used in these analyses ( 500bp ) was much shorter than the SSU sequences ( 1600bp ) .
Altogether , these results demonstrate the utility of the COI as a potential taxonomic DNA barcode for assessing cyphoderiid species diversity and for inferring phylogenetic relationships within the group .
Expanding character sampling for ciliate phylogenetic inference using mitochondrial SSU - rDNA as a molecular marker .
Molecular systematics of ciliates , particularly at deep nodes , has largely focused on increasing taxon sampling using the nuclear small subunit rDNA ( nSSU - rDNA ) locus .
These previous analyses have generally been congruent with morphologically - based classifications , although there is extensive non - monophyly at many levels .
However , caution is needed in interpreting these results as nSSU - rDNA is just a single molecular marker .
Here the mitochondrial small subunit rDNA ( mtSSU - rDNA ) is evaluated for deep ciliate nodes using the Colpodea as an example .
Overall , well - supported nodes in the mtSSU - rDNA and concatenated topologies are well supported in the nSSU - rDNA topology ; e . g . , the non - monophyly of the Cyrtolophosidida .
The two moderately - to well - supported incongruences between the loci are the placement of the Sorogenida and Colpoda:__entity__ aspera:__entity__ . Our analyses of mtSSU - rDNA support the conclusion , originally derived from nSSU - rDNA , that the morphological characters used in taxonomic circumscriptions of the Colpodea represent a mixture of ancestral and derived states .
This demonstration of the efficacy of the mtSSU - rDNA will enable phylogenetic reconstructions of deep nodes in the ciliate tree of life to move from a single - locus to a multi - locus approach .
Diversification and evolution of the avirulence gene AVR - Pita1 in field isolates of Magnaporthe:__entity__ oryzae:__entity__ .
Rice blast disease is the single most destructive plant disease that threatens stable rice:__entity__ production worldwide .
Race - specific resistance to the rice blast pathogen has not been durable and the mechanism by which the resistance is overcome remains largely unknown .
Here we report the molecular mechanisms of diversification and the instability of the avirulence gene AVR - Pita1 in field strains of Magnaporthe:__entity__ oryzae:__entity__ interacting with the host resistance gene Pi - ta and triggering race - specific resistance .
Two - base - pair insertions resulting in frame - shift mutations and partial and complete deletions of AVR - Pita1 were identified in virulent isolates .
Moreover , a total of 38 AVR - Pita1 haplotypes encoding 27 AVR - Pita1 variants were identified among 151 avirulent isolates .
Most DNA sequence variation was found to occur in the exon region resulting in amino acid substitution .
These findings demonstrate that AVR - Pita1 is under positive selection and mutations of AVR - Pita1 are responsible for defeating race - specific resistance in nature .
Analysis of spatial niche structure in coexisting tidepool fishes : null models based on multi - scale experiments .
1 .
Fundamental and realized spatial niches were investigated through a combination of laboratory and mesocosm experiments , field observations and null model analysis in three intertidal gobiid species ( Bathygobius:__entity__ fuscus:__entity__ , Chaenogobius:__entity__ annularis:__entity__ and C:__entity__ .:__entity__ gulosus:__entity__ ) .
Null models based on the results of single - species experiments were used to assess interspecific spatial use and coexistence on two different scales : ( i ) microhabitats within a tidepool ( ' microhabitat ' scale ) ; and ( ii ) distribution among a set of tidepools ( ' habitat - wide ' scale ) .
2 .
Patterns of microhabitat use varied from single to paired treatments , depending on paired species .
Realized overlap of microhabitat use was smaller than would be expected from single - individual situations for intraspecific combinations , but not for interspecific ones .
3 .
Patterns of tidepool occupancy ( a measure of spatial niche breadth ) in the mesocosm were influenced by interspecific interactions .
Two Chaenogobius species , but not B:__entity__ .:__entity__ fuscus:__entity__ , decreased tidepool occupancy in the hetero - specific treatments compared with the mono - specific ones .
For all interspecific combinations , spatial overlap ( habitat - wide scale ) was significantly lower than the values expected from mono - specific situations .
The results also indicated a possible trade - off between competitiveness and growth efficiency in these fishes .
4 .
Interspecific spatial overlap in the field was similar to that in the mesocosm experiment and the pattern of coexistence of gobiids can be explained by the results of our experiments .
5 .
This study demonstrates that niches of intertidal fishes may experience modifications under the influence of species interactions and that null models based on controlled experiments can greatly facilitate the deciphering of such changes in niche structure .
Linking disease and community ecology through behavioural indicators : immunochallenge of white:__entity__ -:__entity__ footed:__entity__ mice:__entity__ and its ecological impacts .
1 .
Pathogens and immune challenges can induce changes in host phenotype in ways that indirectly impact important community interactions , including those that affect host - pathogen interactions .
2 .
To explore host behavioural response to immune challenge , we exposed wild white:__entity__ -:__entity__ footed:__entity__ mice:__entity__ ( Peromyscus:__entity__ leucopus:__entity__ ) to an immunogen from an endemic , zoonotic pathogen , the spirochete Borrelia:__entity__ burgdorferi:__entity__ .
White:__entity__ -:__entity__ footed:__entity__ mice:__entity__ are a major reservoir host of Lyme disease ( LD ) spirochetes in northeastern USA and an abundant member of forest communities .
The activity patterns , foraging behaviour , and space use of white:__entity__ -:__entity__ footed:__entity__ mice:__entity__ have implications for population growth rates of community members upon which mice incidentally prey ( i . e . gypsy moths and native thrushes ) , as well as potentially determining host - vector encounter rates and human:__entity__ risk of LD .
3 .
Immunochallenge led to specific humoral ( antibody ) and cellular ( i . e . elevated neutrophils and eosinophils ) immune responses , supporting use of the immunogen as a surrogate for pathogenic infection .
4 .
Immunochallenged mice had reduced wheel - running activity early in the night when measured in the lab .
However , mouse activity , as measured by track plates in natural field experiments , did not differ between mice exposed to the immunogen and unexposed mice .
5 .
Foraging behaviour of wild mice in the field - assessed with giving - up densities of seed at artificial feeding stations - was affected by exposure to the immunogen .
Whereas immunochallenge did not influence whether foraging mice gained information on patch quality while foraging , it led to reductions in predator avoidance during foraging , suggesting that the proportion of space used by foraging mice may be greater as a result of immunochallenge .
This increased space use is predicted to increase encounter rates with patchily distributed LD vectors ( ticks ) and with incidental prey items .
6 .
Thus , immunochallenge in white:__entity__ -:__entity__ footed:__entity__ mice:__entity__ , and potentially pathogenic infection , have the potential to indirectly impact community interactions , including those important for pathogen transmission .
Amino acid divergence between the CHS domain contributes to the different intracellular behaviour of Family II fungal chitin synthases in Saccharomyces:__entity__ cerevisiae:__entity__ .
Family II chitin synthases ( CS ) , including classes IV and V enzymes , share conserved catalytic domains flanked by transmembrane regions .
Here we addressed the characterization of Family II fungal CSs by heterologous expression in Saccharomyces:__entity__ cerevisiae:__entity__ .
Full - length CSs from classes V or IV were not functional when expressed in S:__entity__ .:__entity__ cerevisiae:__entity__ and accumulated in different intracellular compartments .
However , the exchange between different class IV , but not of class V , CHS domains resulted in functional proteins both in vivo and in vitro .
The different domains afford the chimeric proteins distinct intracellular behaviours , ranging from endoplasmic reticulum retention to reduced endocytic turnover at the plasma membrane .
These results allow a role in chitin synthesis to be assigned to all class IV enzymes , but they also highlight the involvement of the intracellular globular domain of these CSs , not only in enzymatic activity but also in the regulation of their intracellular turnover .
Activation of the heat shock transcription factor Hsf1 is essential for the full virulence of the fungal pathogen Candida:__entity__ albicans:__entity__ .
The evolutionarily conserved heat shock transcription factor Hsf1 plays a central role in thermal adaptation in the major fungal pathogen of humans:__entity__ , Candida:__entity__ albicans:__entity__ .
Hsf1 becomes hyperphosphorylated in response to heat shock and activates the transcription of genes with heat shock elements ( HSEs ) in their promoters , these genes contributing to thermal adaptation .
However , the relevance of Hsf1 activation to C:__entity__ .:__entity__ albicans:__entity__ virulence is not clear as this pathogen is thought to be obligately associated with warm blooded animals , and this issue has not been tested because HSF1 is essential for viability in C:__entity__ .:__entity__ albicans:__entity__ .
In this study , we demonstrate that the HSE regulon is active in C:__entity__ .:__entity__ albicans:__entity__ cells infecting the kidney .
We also show the CE2 region of Hsf1 is required for activation and that the phosphorylation of specific residues in this domain contributes to Hsf1 activation .
C:__entity__ .:__entity__ albicans:__entity__ HSF1 mutants that lack this CE2 region are viable .
However , they are unable to activate HSE - containing genes in response to heat shock , and they are thermosensitive .
Using this HSF1 CE2 deletion mutant we demonstrate that Hsf1 activation , and hence thermal adaptation , contributes significantly to the virulence of C:__entity__ .:__entity__ albicans:__entity__ .
Early response of plant cell to carbon deprivation : in vivo 31P - NMR spectroscopy shows a quasi - instantaneous disruption on cytosolic sugars , phosphorylated intermediates of energy metabolism , phosphate partitioning , and intracellular pHs .
* In plant cells , sugar starvation triggers a cascade of effects at the scale of 1 - 2 days .
However , very early metabolic response has not yet been investigated .
* Soluble phosphorus ( P ) compounds and intracellular pHs were analysed each 2 . 5 min intervals in heterotrophic sycamore:__entity__ ( Acer:__entity__ pseudoplatanus:__entity__ ) cells using in vivo phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance ( ( 31 ) P - NMR ) .
* Upon external - sugar withdrawal , the glucose 6 - P concentration dropped in the cytosol , but not in plastids .
The released inorganic phosphate ( Pi ) accumulated transiently in the cytosol before influx into the vacuole ; nucleotide triphosphate concentration doubled , intracellular pH increased and cell respiration decreased .
It was deduced that the cytosolic free - sugar concentration was low , corresponding to only 0 . 5 mM sucrose in sugar - supplied cells .
* The release of sugar from the vacuole and from plastids is insufficient to fully sustain the cell metabolism during starvation , particularly in the very short term .
Similarly to Pi - starvation , the cell ' s first response to sugar starvation occurs in the cytosol and is of a metabolic nature .
Unlike the cytoplasm , cytosolic homeostasis is not maintained during starvation .
The important metabolic changes following cytosolic sugar exhaustion deliver early endogenous signals that may contribute to trigger rescue metabolism .
Habitat contrasts reveal a shift in the trophic position of ant assemblages .
1 .
Trophic structure within a guild can be influenced by factors such as resource availability and competition .
While ants occupy a wide range of positions in food webs , and ant community composition changes with habitat , it is not well understood if ant genera tend to maintain their position in the trophic structure , or if trophic position varies across habitats .
2 .
We used ratios of stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen to test for differences in the trophic structure and position of assemblages of ants among habitat types .
We tested for differences between assemblages in replicate sites of the land use categories : ( i ) pastures with old large trees ; ( ii ) recently revegetated pastures with small young trees ; and ( iii ) remnant woodlands .
Known insect herbivores and predatory spiders provided baselines for herbivorous and predaceous arthropods .
Soil samples were used to correct for the base level of isotopic enrichment at each site .
3 .
We found no significant interactions between land use and ant genus for isotope enrichment , indicating that trophic structure is conserved across land use categories .
The fixed relative positions of genera in the trophic structure might be re - enforced by competition or some other factor .
However , the entire ant assemblage had significantly lower delta ( 15 ) N values in revegetated sites , suggesting that ants feed lower down in the food chain i . e . they are more ' herbivorous ' in revegetated sites .
This may be a result of the high availability of plant sugars , honeydew and herbivorous arthropod prey .
4 .
Surprisingly , ants in remnants and pastures with trees displayed similar isotopic compositions .
Interactions within ant assemblages are thus likely to be resilient to changes in land use , but ant diets in early successional habitats may reflect the simplicity of communities , which may have comparatively lower rates of saprophagy and predation .
Hypoxia responsive gene expression is mediated by various subsets of transcription factors and miRNAs that are determined by the actual oxygen availability .
* Reduced oxygen availability is not only associated with flooding , but occurs also during growth and development .
It is largely unknown how hypoxia is perceived and what signaling cascade is involved in activating adaptive responses .
* We analysed the expression of over 1900 transcription factors ( TFs ) and 180 microRNA primary transcripts ( pri - miRNAs ) in Arabidopsis roots exposed to different hypoxic conditions by means of quantitative PCR .
We also analysed the promoters of genes induced by hypoxia with respect to over - represented DNA elements that can act as potential TF binding sites and their in vivo interaction was verified .
* We identified various subsets of TFs that responded differentially through time and in an oxygen concentration - dependent manner .
The regulatory potential of selected TFs and their predicted DNA binding elements was validated .
Although the expression of pri - miRNAs was differentially regulated under hypoxia , only one corresponding mature miRNA changed accordingly .
Putative target transcripts of the miRNAs were not significantly affected .
* Our results show that the regulation of hypoxia - induced genes is controlled via simultaneous interaction of various combinations of TFs .
Under anoxic conditions , an additional set of TFs is induced .
Regulation of gene expression via miRNAs appears to play a minor role during hypoxia .
Rarity , life history and scaling of the dynamics in time and space of British birds .
1 .
Many patterns in macroecology are closely related to the total abundance of a species in a region .
Here we show that interspecific differences in the pattern of population fluctuations of British bird species can be predicted from knowledge of their overall abundance and some basic life - history characteristics .
2 .
We identify a rarity syndrome that arises through an increased stochastic influence on population fluctuations with decreasing population size , mainly resulting from an inverse density - dependent effect of demographic stochasticity .
This syndrome involves an increase in the annual changes in population size with increasing rarity in the United Kingdom .
3 .
The relationship between the magnitude of temporal variation and local mean population size differs between species dependent on their life history , i . e . species with larger clutch size and lower survival tended to have larger annual changes in population size than low - reproducing long - lived species .
4 .
The probability of local disappearance from a study plot depended on the population size and was hence closely related to the overall abundance of the species in UK .
For a given population size , this probability was also related to species - specific life - history characteristics , being higher in species with larger clutch sizes and smaller survival rates .
5 .
Rareness results in a spatial decoupling of the temporal variation in population size .
6 .
These patterns show that once a species has become rare , e . g . due to human:__entity__ activities , key population dynamical characteristics will change because of density - dependent stochastic effects , which in turn are dependent on species - specific life - history characteristics .
Mannitol permeation and radial flow of water in maize:__entity__ roots .
* The postulated nonselective hydraulic route through the root apoplast has not yet been supported by experimental findings on solvent drag .
* Therefore , mannitol transport from the medium to the shoot of young maize:__entity__ plants was studied at different rates of transpiration in hydroculture .
The concentration of mannitol was determined by gas chromatography .
* Mannitol utilization in shoot metabolism was not detectable .
Experiments with exuding roots showed that the radial transport of mannitol was mainly apoplastic .
The ratio alpha between the mannitol concentration in xylem vessels and that of the external medium was calculated from mannitol translocation to the shoot or measurement of the mannitol concentration in the root exudate , where it reached c .
0 . 07 in the steady state .
In transpiring plants , alpha decreased with increasing water flux from 0 . 04 to values below 0 . 01 .
These findings demonstrate that the root reflection coefficient for mannitol is above 0 . 99 .
* It is concluded that the radial movement of water to the vessels is under complete protoplastic control , whereas solutes can diffuse on an apoplastic path .
The absence of a significant volume flux through the root apoplast is of physiological importance as it prevents the coupling of the apoplastic permeation of ballast solutes , such as NaCl , to transpiration .
Genomic evidence of repeat - induced point mutation ( RIP ) in filamentous ascomycetes .
The genomes of 49 filamentous ascomycetes ( subphylum Pezizomycotina ) were examined by two independent methods for evidence of multiple C - > T transitions typical of RIP .
At least one transposable element or other repeat family was identified in each genome , and members were assessed for transition and transversion mutations relative to a model of their intact progenitor .
Occurrence of RIP was indicated where family members differed by excess of directional transitions over transversions .
Transition mutations were quantified by an algorithm taking double mutations in CpG and CpC dinucleotides into account .
A second method assessed dinucleotide frequency distribution anomalies in whole genomes , a procedure that allowed quantification of fractions of the non - coding genome that had been subject to extensive directional mutation .
The results of both methods revealed that RIP - like activity varied greatly , both in extent of mutation and in dinucleotide context for C - > T transitions .
In the most extreme case , 75 % of a Blastomyces:__entity__ dermatitidis:__entity__ genome had suffered conspicuous GC - depletion , all of it in the non - coding fraction .
Many genomes carried both intact repeats as well as others that had suffered heavily from transitions .
Only one species , Chaetomium:__entity__ globosum:__entity__ , showed no evidence of directional mutation .
Accelerometry estimates field metabolic rate in giant:__entity__ Australian:__entity__ cuttlefish:__entity__ Sepia:__entity__ apama:__entity__ during breeding .
1 .
Estimating the metabolic rate of animals in nature is central to understanding the physiological , behavioural and evolutionary ecology of animals .
Doubly labelled water and heart - rate methods are the most commonly used approaches , but both have limitations that preclude their application to some systems .
2 .
Accelerometry has emerged as a powerful tool for estimating energy expenditure in a range of animals , but is yet to be used to estimate field metabolic rate in aquatic taxa .
We combined two - dimensional accelerometry and swim - tunnel respirometry to estimate patterns of energy expenditure in giant:__entity__ Australian:__entity__ cuttlefish:__entity__ Sepia:__entity__ apama:__entity__ during breeding .
3 .
Both oxygen consumption rate ( Vo2 ) and swimming speed showed strong positive associations with body acceleration , with coefficients of determination comparable to those using similar accelerometers on terrestrial vertebrates .
Despite increased activity during the day , field metabolic rate rarely approached Vo2 , and night - time Vo2 was similar to that at rest .
4 .
These results are consistent with the life - history strategy of this species , which has a poor capacity to exercise anaerobically , and a mating strategy that is visually based .
With the logistical difficulties associated with observation in aquatic environments , accelerometry is likely to prove a valuable tool for estimating energy expenditure in aquatic animals .
Generation of Se - fortified broccoli:__entity__ as functional food : impact of Se fertilization on S metabolism .
Selenium ( Se ) - fortified broccoli:__entity__ ( Brassica:__entity__ oleracea:__entity__ var:__entity__ .:__entity__ italica:__entity__ ) has been proposed as a functional food for cancer prevention , based on its high glucosinolate ( GSL ) content and capacity for Se accumulation .
However , as selenate and sulphate share the initial assimilation route , Se fertilization could interfere with sulphur metabolism and plant growth .
Consequently , GSL accumulation could be compromised .
To evaluate these potentially adverse effects of Se fertilization , we performed a comprehensive study on sand - grown young broccoli:__entity__ plants ( weekly selenate applications of 0 . 8 mumol plant ( - 1 ) via the root ) and field - grown adult broccoli:__entity__ plants during head formation ( single foliar selenate application : 25 . 3 or 253 mumol plant ( - 1 ) ) .
The results show that under these conditions , Se application does not affect plant growth , contents of cysteine , glutathione , total GSL , glucoraphanin ( major aliphatic GSL ) or the expression of BoMYB28 ( encoding a functionally confirmed master regulator for aliphatic GSL biosynthesis ) .
Conversely , due to the changed expression of sulphate transporters ( BoSULTR1 ; 1 , 1 ; 2 , 2 ; 1 , and 2 ; 2 ) , sulphate and total S contents increased in the shoot of young plants while decreasing in the root .
We conclude that broccoli:__entity__ can be fertilized with Se without reduction in GSL content , even with Se accumulation exceeding the level recommended for human:__entity__ consumption .
Arbuscular mycorrhizal hyphopodia and germinated spore exudates trigger Ca2 + spiking in the legume and nonlegume root epidermis .
* The aim of this study was to investigate Ca ( 2 + ) responses to endosymbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal ( AM ) fungi in the host root epidermis following pre - infection hyphopodium formation in both legumes and nonlegumes , and to determine to what extent these responses could be mimicked by germinated fungal:__entity__ spore exudate .
* Root organ cultures of both Medicago:__entity__ truncatula:__entity__ and Daucus:__entity__ carota:__entity__ , expressing the nuclear - localized cameleon reporter NupYC2 . 1 , were used to monitor AM - elicited Ca ( 2 + ) responses in host root tissues .
* Ca ( 2 + ) spiking was observed in cells contacted by AM hyphopodia for both hosts , with highest frequencies correlating with the epidermal nucleus positioned facing the fungal contact site .
Treatment with AM spore exudate also elicited Ca ( 2 + ) spiking within the AM - responsive zone of the root and , in both cases , spiking was dependent on the M:__entity__ .:__entity__ truncatula:__entity__ common SYM genes DMI1 / 2 , but not on the rhizobial Nod factor perception gene NFP .
* These findings support the conclusion that AM fungal root penetration is preceded by a SYM pathway - dependent oscillatory Ca ( 2 + ) response , whose evolutionary origin predates the divergence between asterid and rosid clades .
Our results further show that fungal symbiotic signals are already generated during spore germination , and that cameleon - expressing root organ cultures represent a novel AM - specific bio - assay for such signals .
The Perigord:__entity__ black:__entity__ truffle:__entity__ responds to cold temperature with an extensive reprogramming of its transcriptional activity .
The Tuber:__entity__ melanosporum:__entity__ genome has been analysed with the aim of identifying and characterizing the genes involved in the environmental stress response .
A whole genome array ( 7496 genes / probe ) was used to verify the fungal transcriptional profiling upon a cold temperature period ( 7 days at 4 ^ 0C ) .
A total of 423 genes resulted to be differentially expressed in a significant manner ( > 2 . 5 - fold ; p - value & lt ; 0 . 05 ) in the mycelia exposed to cold , compared to the control ones : 187 of these genes were up - regulated , while 236 were down - regulated .
Sixty - six and fifty - one percent , respectively , of the up - or down - regulated transcripts had no KOG classification and were clustered as unclassified proteins , which was the most abundant category in the both up - and down - regulated genes .
A gene subset , containing a range of biological functions , was chosen to validate the microarray experiment through quantitative real time PCR ( qRT - PCR ) .
The analysis confirmed the array data for 16 out of 22 of the considered genes , confirming that a cold temperature period influences the truffle global gene expression .
The expressed genes , which mostly resulted to be genes for heat shock proteins ( HSPs ) and genes involved in cell wall and lipid metabolism , could be involved in mechanisms , which are responsible for fungal adaptation .
Since truffle ascomata develop during the winter period , we hypothesize that these differentially expressed genes may help the truffle to adapt to low temperatures and / or perceive environmental signals that regulate the fructification .
The rapid production of high - titer porcine:__entity__ endogenous:__entity__ retrovirus:__entity__ ( PERV ) - B env pseudotype and construction of an EGFP - expressing replication competent PERV - A vector .
Porcine:__entity__ endogenous:__entity__ retroviruses:__entity__ ( PERVs:__entity__ ) present a unique concern associated with xenotransplantation because they have been shown to infect certain human:__entity__ cells in vitro and it is also difficult to generate herds of pigs:__entity__ free of PERVs:__entity__ .
A simple system for the production of high - titer MoMLV - PERV pseudotypes is reported ; an EGFP - expressing replication - competent molecular clone that allows direct measurement of titer was also constructed .
To improve the MLV - based retroviral:__entity__ vector system , a 2 . 1 - kb PERV:__entity__ - B env product was amplified from PK - 15 genomic DNA and cloned into the pCL - Eco retroviral vector .
The titer of lacZ ( PERV:__entity__ -:__entity__ B:__entity__ ) from the 293 cells was about 1 . 0x10 ( 4 ) CFU / ml .
In contrast , the titer of lacZ ( PERV - B ) from a conventional murine retroviral:__entity__ vector ( split genome ) was found to be 1 . 2x10 ( 2 ) CFU / ml when the PERV:__entity__ -:__entity__ B:__entity__ env expression vector was transfected into TELCeB6 cells , which harbor MFGnlslacZ and the gag - pol - expressing vector .
In addition , an infectious PERV:__entity__ -:__entity__ A:__entity__ clone containing enhanced GFP ( EGFP ) by using a PCR - based method was developed .
This EGFP - expressing PERV - A - IRES - EGFP molecular clone was found to be stable genetically on transfection in 293 cells .
Rhizomastix biflagellata sp . nov . , a new amoeboflagellate of uncertain phylogenetic position isolated from frogs .
The genus Rhizomastix contains five species of amoeboflagellates with a single anterior flagellum , which live as intestinal symbionts of insects and amphibians .
Though established in 1911 , Rhizomastix has been neglected for decades and its phylogenetic position is uncertain .
This paper describes the morphology of the first cultivated strain of Rhizomastix .
The organism was isolated from an argentine horned frog and differs from the known Rhizomastix species by the presence of biflagellate cells .
The isolate is described as Rhizomastix biflagellata sp . nov .
A possible relationship of Rhizomastix to Archamoebae is discussed .
Whole - genome sequences of thirteen isolates of Borrelia:__entity__ burgdorferi:__entity__ .
Borrelia:__entity__ burgdorferi:__entity__ is a causative agent of Lyme disease in North America and Eurasia .
The first complete genome sequence of B:__entity__ .:__entity__ burgdorferi:__entity__ strain:__entity__ 31:__entity__ , available for more than a decade , has assisted research on the pathogenesis of Lyme disease .
Because a single genome sequence is not sufficient to understand the relationship between genotypic and geographic variation and disease phenotype , we determined the whole - genome sequences of 13 additional B:__entity__ .:__entity__ burgdorferi:__entity__ isolates that span the range of natural variation .
These sequences should allow improved understanding of pathogenesis and provide a foundation for novel detection , diagnosis , and prevention strategies .
Association between nonsynonymous mutations of starch synthase IIa and starch quality in rice:__entity__ ( Oryza:__entity__ sativa:__entity__ ) .
Starch quality is one of the most important agronomic traits in Asian:__entity__ rice:__entity__ , Oryza:__entity__ sativa:__entity__ .
Starch synthase IIa ( SsIIa ) is a major candidate gene for starch quality variation .
Within SsIIa , three nonsynonymous mutations in exon 8 have been shown to affect enzyme activity when expressed in Escherichia:__entity__ coli:__entity__ .
To search for the variation in SsIIa that is responsible for starch quality variation in rice:__entity__ , we sequenced the SsIIa exon 8 region and measured starch quality as starch disintegration in alkali for 289 accessions of cultivated rice:__entity__ and 57 accessions of its wild ancestor , Oryza:__entity__ rufipogon:__entity__ .
A general linear model and nested clade analysis were used to identify the associations between the three nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) and starch quality .
Among the three nonsynonymous SNPs , we found strong evidence of association at one nucleotide site ( ' SNP 3 ' ) , corresponding to a Leu / Phe replacement at codon 781 .
A second SNP , corresponding to a Val / Met replacement at codon 737 , could potentially show an association with increased sample sizes .
Variation in SsIIa enzyme activity is associated with the cohesiveness of rice:__entity__ grains when cooked , and our findings are consistent with selection for more cohesive grains during the domestication of tropical:__entity__ japonica:__entity__ rice:__entity__ .
Ecological differentiation in xylem cavitation resistance is associated with stem and leaf structural traits .
Cavitation resistance is a critical determinant of drought tolerance in tropical tree species , but little is known of its association with life history strategies , particularly for seasonal dry forests , a system critically driven by variation in water availability .
We analysed vulnerability curves for saplings of 13 tropical dry forest tree species differing in life history and leaf phenology .
We examined how vulnerability to cavitation ( P50 ) related to dry season leaf water potentials and stem and leaf traits .
P50 - values ranged from - 0 . 8 to - 6 . 2 MPa , with pioneers on average 38 % more vulnerable to cavitation than shade - tolerants .
Vulnerability to cavitation was related to structural traits conferring tissue stress vulnerability , being negatively correlated with wood density , and surprisingly maximum vessel length .
Vulnerability to cavitation was negatively related to the Huber - value and leaf dry matter content , and positively with leaf size .
It was not related to SLA .
We found a strong trade - off between cavitation resistance and hydraulic efficiency .
Most species in the field were operating at leaf water potentials well above their P50 , but pioneers and deciduous species had smaller hydraulic safety margins than shade - tolerants and evergreens .
A trade - off between hydraulic safety and efficiency underlies ecological differentiation across these tropical dry forest tree species .
Genetics of lung - cancer susceptibility .
Lung cancer is the most common form of cancer death worldwide .
Although reduction of tobacco:__entity__ consumption remains the most appropriate strategy to reduce lung - cancer burden , identification of genes involved in the cause of disease could contribute to further understanding of the underlying mechanisms , and eventually lead to additional prevention strategies and targeted treatments .
Common gene variants involved in lung cancer have been recently identified through large , collaborative , genome - wide association studies .
These studies identified three separate loci that are associated with lung cancer ( 5p15 , 6p21 , and 15q25 ) and include genes that regulate acetylcholine nicotinic receptors and telomerase production .
However , much about genetic risk remains to be discovered , and rarer gene variants , such as those of the CHEK2 gene , likely account for most of the remaining risk .
There is also a need for studies that investigate how genetic susceptibility is associated with clinical outcome measures , including treatment response and tumour relapse .
The validation of a real - time RT - PCR assay which detects influenza A and types simultaneously for influenza:__entity__ A:__entity__ H1N1:__entity__ ( 2009 ) and oseltamivir - resistant ( H275Y ) influenza A H1N1 ( 2009 ) .
Influenza A H1N1 ( 2009 ) was declared by the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) as the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century .
Rapid detection of influenza A and differentiation of influenza A H1N1 ( 2009 ) and seasonal influenza A is beneficial .
In addition the rapid detection of antiviral resistant strains of influenza A H1N1 ( 2009 ) would be useful for clinicians to allow for change to an effective treatment at a much earlier stage if resistance is found .
It was the aim of this study to develop a real - time RT - PCR that can detect all influenza:__entity__ A:__entity__ viruses:__entity__ and type simultaneously for influenza:__entity__ A:__entity__ H1N1:__entity__ ( 2009 ) and oseltamivir resistant ( H275Y ) influenza:__entity__ A:__entity__ H1N1:__entity__ ( 2009 ) .
This multiplex assay will allow laboratories to screen respiratory samples for all types of influenza:__entity__ A:__entity__ , influenza:__entity__ A:__entity__ H1N1:__entity__ ( 2009 ) virus and oseltamivir resistant ( H275Y ) influenza:__entity__ A:__entity__ H1N1:__entity__ ( 2009 ) virus in a rapid and cost effective format , ensuring that typing methods for seasonal and avian viruses are used on a smaller subset of samples .
Since most virology laboratories already offer a molecular service for influenza A this assay could easily be implemented into most areas at little cost therefore increasing local access to resistance testing .
Comparison of seasonal variations in water - use efficiency calculated from the carbon isotope composition of tree rings and flux data in a temperate forest .
Tree - ring delta ( 13 ) C is often interpreted in terms of intrinsic water - use efficiency ( WUE ) using a carbon isotope discrimination model established at the leaf level .
We examined whether intra - ring delta ( 13 ) C could be used to assess variations in intrinsic WUE ( W ( g ) , the ratio of carbon assimilation and stomatal conductance to water ) and variations in ecosystem WUE ( W ( t ) , the ratio of C assimilation and transpiration ) at a seasonal scale .
Intra - ring delta ( 13 ) C was measured in 30 - to 60 - mum - thick slices in eight oak trees ( Quercus:__entity__ petraea:__entity__ ) .
Canopy W ( g ) was simulated using a physiologically process - based model .
High between - tree variability was observed in the seasonal variations of intra - ring delta ( 13 ) C .
Six trees showed significant positive correlations between W ( g ) calculated from intra - ring delta ( 13 ) C and canopy W ( g ) averaged over several days during latewood formation .
These results suggest that latewood is a seasonal recorder of W ( g ) trends , with a temporal lag corresponding to the mixing time of sugars in the phloem .
These six trees also showed significant negative correlations between photosynthetic discrimination Delta calculated from intra - ring delta ( 13 ) C , and ecosystem W ( t ) , during latewood formation .
Despite the observed between - tree variability , these results indicate that intra - ring delta ( 13 ) C can be used to access seasonal variations in past W ( t ) .
Resistance and recovery of soil microbial communities in the face of Alliaria:__entity__ petiolata:__entity__ invasions .
Invaders can gain ecological advantages because of their evolutionary novelty , but little is known about how these novel advantages will change over time as the invader and invaded community evolve in response to each other .
Invasive plants often gain such an advantage through alteration of soil microbial communities .
In soil communities sampled from sites along a gradient of invasion history with Alliaria:__entity__ petiolata:__entity__ , microbial richness tended to decline , but the community ' s resistance to A:__entity__ .:__entity__ petiolata:__entity__ ' s effects generally increased with increasing history of invasion .
However , sensitive microbial taxa appeared to recover in the two oldest sites , leading to an increase in richness , but consequent decrease in resistance .
This may be because of evolutionary changes in the A:__entity__ .:__entity__ petiolata:__entity__ populations , which tend to reduce their investment to allelopathic compounds over time .
These results show that , over time , microbial communities can develop resistance to an invasive plant but at the cost of lower richness .
However , over longer time - scales evolution in the invasive species may allow for the recovery of soil microbial communities .
Differentiating between effects of invasion and diversity : impacts of aboveground plant communities on belowground fungal communities .
Exotic plant species can affect soil microbial communities with the potential for community and ecosystem feedbacks .
Yet , separating the effects of exotics from confounded changes in plant community diversity still remains a challenge .
We focused on how plant diversity and native or exotic life history affected root fungi because of their significant roles in community and ecosystem processes .
Specifically , we examined how fungi colonizing plant roots were affected by plant richness ( one , two or four species ) replicated across a range of plant community mixtures ( natives , exotics , native - exotic mixtures ) .
Fungal biomass inside roots was affected independently by plant richness and mixture , while root fungal community composition was affected only by plant richness .
Extraradical networks also increased in size with plant richness .
By contrast , plant biomass was a function of plant mixture , with natives consistently smaller than exotics and native - exotic mixtures intermediate .
Plant invasions may have an impact on the belowground community primarily through their effects on diversity , at least in the short - term .
Disentangling the effects of diversity and invasion on belowground microbial communities can help us to understand both the controllers of belowground resilience and mechanisms of successful colonization and spread of exotic plants .
Neuropeptide precursor gene discovery in the Chagas disease vector Rhodnius:__entity__ prolixus:__entity__ .
We show a straightforward workflow combining homology search in Rhodnius:__entity__ prolixus:__entity__ genome sequence with cloning by rapid amplification of cDNA ends and mass spectrometry .
We have identified 32 genes and their transcripts that encode a number of neuropeptide precursors leading to 194 putative peptides .
We validated by mass spectrometry 82 of those predicted neuropeptides in the brain of R:__entity__ .:__entity__ prolixus:__entity__ to achieve the first comprehensive genomic , transcriptomic and neuropeptidomic analysis of an insect disease vector .
Comparisons of available insect neuropeptide sequences revealed that the R:__entity__ .:__entity__ prolixus:__entity__ genome contains most of the conserved neuropeptides in insects , many of them displaying specific features at the sequence level .
Some gene families reported here are identified for the first time in the order Hemiptera , a highly biodiverse group of insects that includes many human:__entity__ , animal and plant disease agents .
The alphaherpesvirus US3 / ORF66 protein kinases direct phosphorylation of the nuclear matrix protein matrin 3 .
The protein kinase found in the short region of alphaherpesviruses , termed US3 in herpes:__entity__ simplex:__entity__ virus:__entity__ type:__entity__ 1:__entity__ ( HSV:__entity__ -:__entity__ 1:__entity__ ) and pseudorabies:__entity__ virus:__entity__ ( PRV:__entity__ ) and ORF66 in varicella:__entity__ -:__entity__ zoster:__entity__ virus:__entity__ ( VZV:__entity__ ) , affects several viral and host cell processes , and its specific targets remain an area of active investigation .
Reports suggesting that HSV:__entity__ -:__entity__ 1:__entity__ US3 substrates overlap with those of cellular protein kinase A ( PKA ) prompted the use of an antibody specific for phosphorylated PKA substrates to identify US3 / ORF66 targets .
HSV:__entity__ -:__entity__ 1:__entity__ , VZV:__entity__ , and PRV:__entity__ induced very different substrate profiles that were US3 / ORF66 kinase dependent .
The predominant VZV:__entity__ - phosphorylated 125 - kDa species was identified as matrin 3 , one of the major nuclear matrix proteins .
Matrin 3 was also phosphorylated by HSV:__entity__ -:__entity__ 1:__entity__ and PRV:__entity__ in a US3 kinase - dependent manner and by VZV:__entity__ ORF66 kinase at a novel residue ( KRRRT150EE ) .
Since VZV:__entity__ - directed T150 phosphorylation was not blocked by PKA inhibitors and was not induced by PKA activation , and since PKA predominantly targeted matrin 3 S188 , it was concluded that phosphorylation by VZV:__entity__ was PKA independent .
However , purified VZV:__entity__ ORF66 kinase did not phosphorylate matrin 3 in vitro , suggesting that additional cellular factors were required .
In VZV:__entity__ - infected cells in the absence of the ORF66 kinase , matrin 3 displayed intranuclear changes , while matrin 3 showed a pronounced cytoplasmic distribution in late - stage cells infected with US3 - negative HSV:__entity__ -:__entity__ 1:__entity__ or PRV:__entity__ .
This work identifies phosphorylation of the nuclear matrix protein matrin 3 as a new conserved target of this kinase group .
Small - molecule inhibition of human:__entity__ immunodeficiency:__entity__ virus:__entity__ type:__entity__ 1:__entity__ infection by virus capsid destabilization .
Human:__entity__ immunodeficiency:__entity__ virus:__entity__ type:__entity__ 1:__entity__ ( HIV:__entity__ -:__entity__ 1:__entity__ ) infection is dependent on the proper disassembly of the viral capsid , or & quot ; uncoating , & quot ; in target cells .
The HIV:__entity__ -:__entity__ 1:__entity__ capsid consists of a conical multimeric complex of the viral capsid protein ( CA ) arranged in a hexagonal lattice .
Mutations in CA that destabilize the viral capsid result in impaired infection owing to defects in reverse transcription in target cells .
We describe here the mechanism of action of a small molecule HIV:__entity__ -:__entity__ 1:__entity__ inhibitor , PF - 3450074 ( PF74 ) , which targets CA .
PF74 acts at an early stage of HIV:__entity__ -:__entity__ 1:__entity__ infection and inhibits reverse transcription in target cells .
We show that PF74 binds specifically to HIV:__entity__ -:__entity__ 1:__entity__ particles , and substitutions in CA that confer resistance to the compound prevent binding .
A single point mutation in CA that stabilizes the HIV:__entity__ -:__entity__ 1:__entity__ core also conferred strong resistance to the virus without inhibiting compound binding .
Treatment of HIV:__entity__ -:__entity__ 1:__entity__ particles or purified cores with PF74 destabilized the viral capsid in vitro .
Furthermore , the compound induced the rapid dissolution of the HIV:__entity__ -:__entity__ 1:__entity__ capsid in target cells .
PF74 antiviral activity was promoted by binding of the host protein cyclophilin A to the HIV:__entity__ -:__entity__ 1:__entity__ capsid , and PF74 and cyclosporine exhibited mutual antagonism .
Our data suggest that PF74 triggers premature HIV:__entity__ -:__entity__ 1:__entity__ uncoating in target cells , thereby mimicking the activity of the retrovirus restriction factor TRIM5alpha .
This study highlights uncoating as a step in the HIV:__entity__ -:__entity__ 1:__entity__ life cycle that is susceptible to small molecule intervention .
PB2 residue 158 is a pathogenic determinant of pandemic H1N1:__entity__ and H5:__entity__ influenza:__entity__ a:__entity__ viruses:__entity__ in mice:__entity__ .
Influenza:__entity__ A:__entity__ viruses:__entity__ are human:__entity__ and animal pathogens that cause morbidity and mortality , which range from mild to severe .
The 2009 H1N1:__entity__ pandemic was caused by the emergence of a reassortant H1N1:__entity__ subtype ( H1N1pdm:__entity__ ) influenza:__entity__ A:__entity__ virus:__entity__ containing gene segments that originally circulated in human:__entity__ , avian , and swine:__entity__ virus reservoirs .
The molecular determinants of replication and pathogenesis of H1N1pdm:__entity__ viruses:__entity__ in humans:__entity__ and other mammals are poorly understood .
Therefore , we set out to elucidate viral determinants critical to the pathogenesis of this novel reassortant using a mouse:__entity__ model .
We found that a glutamate - to - glycine substitution at residue 158 of the PB2 gene ( PB2 - E158G ) increased the morbidity and mortality of the parental H1N1pdm:__entity__ virus:__entity__ .
Results from mini - genome replication assays in human:__entity__ cells and virus titration in mouse:__entity__ tissues demonstrated that PB2 - E158G is a pathogenic determinant , because it significantly increases viral replication rates .
The virus load in PB2 - E158G - infected mouse:__entity__ lungs was 1 , 300 - fold higher than that of the wild - type virus .
Our data also show that PB2 - E158G had a much stronger influence on the RNA replication and pathogenesis of H1N1pdm:__entity__ viruses:__entity__ than PB2 - E627K , which is a known pathogenic determinant .
Remarkably , PB2 - E158G substitutions also altered the pathotypes of two avian H5:__entity__ viruses:__entity__ in mice:__entity__ , indicating that this residue impacts genetically divergent influenza:__entity__ A:__entity__ viruses:__entity__ and suggesting that this region of PB2 could be a new antiviral target .
Collectively , the data presented in this study demonstrate that PB2 - E158G is a novel pathogenic determinant of influenza:__entity__ A:__entity__ viruses:__entity__ in the mouse:__entity__ model .
We speculate that PB2 - E158G may be important in the adaptation of avian PB2 genes to other mammals , and BLAST sequence analysis identified a naturally occurring human:__entity__ H1N1pdm:__entity__ isolate that has this substitution .
Therefore , future surveillance efforts should include scrutiny of this region of PB2 because of its potential impact on pathogenesis .
Hepatitis:__entity__ C:__entity__ virus:__entity__ NS2 protein serves as a scaffold for virus assembly by interacting with both structural and nonstructural proteins .
Many aspects of the assembly of hepatitis:__entity__ C:__entity__ virus:__entity__ ( HCV:__entity__ ) remain incompletely understood .
To characterize the role of NS2 in the production of infectious virus , we determined NS2 interaction partners among other HCV:__entity__ proteins during productive infection .
Pulldown assays showed that NS2 forms complexes with both structural and nonstructural proteins , including E1 , E2 , p7 , NS3 , and NS5A .
Confocal microscopy also demonstrated that NS2 colocalizes with E1 , E2 , and NS5A in dot - like structures near lipid droplets .
However , NS5A did not coprecipitate with E2 and interacted only weakly with NS3 in pulldown assays .
Also , there was no demonstrable interaction between p7 and E2 or NS3 in such assays .
Therefore , NS2 is uniquely capable of interacting with both structural and nonstructural proteins .
Among mutations in p7 , NS2 , and NS3 that prevent production of infectious virus , only p7 mutations significantly reduced NS2 - mediated protein interactions .
These p7 mutations altered the intracellular distribution of NS2 and E2 and appeared to modulate the membrane topology of the C - terminal domain of NS2 .
These results suggest that NS2 acts to coordinate virus assembly by mediating interactions between envelope proteins and NS3 and NS5A within replication complexes adjacent to lipid droplets , where virus particle assembly is thought to occur .
p7 may play an accessory role by regulating NS2 membrane topology , which is important for NS2 - mediated protein interactions and therefore NS2 function .
Alcohol dehydrogenase and hydrogenase transcript fluctuations during a day - night cycle in Chlamydomonas:__entity__ reinhardtii:__entity__ : the role of anoxia .
* The unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas:__entity__ reinhardtii:__entity__ contains two iron ( Fe ) - hydrogenases which are responsible for hydrogen production under anoxia .
In the present work the patterns of expression of alcohol dehydrogenase , a typical anaerobic gene in plants , of the hydrogenases genes ( HYD1 , HYD2 ) and of the genes responsible for their maturation ( HYDEF , HYDG ) , were analysed .
* The expression patterns were analysed by real - time reverse - transcription polymerase chain reaction in Chlamydomonas cultures during the day - night cycle , as well as in response to oxygen availability .
* The results indicated that ADH1 , HYD1 , HYD2 , HYDEF and HYDG were expressed following precise day - night fluctuations .
ADH1 and HYD2 were modulated by the day - night cycle .
Low oxygen plays an important role for the induction of HYD1 , HYDEF and HYDG , while ADH1 and HYD2 expression was relatively insensitive to oxygen availability .
* The regulation of the anaerobic gene expression in Chlamydomonas is only partly explained by responses to anoxia .
The cell cycle and light - dark cycles are equally important elements in the regulatory network modulating the anaerobic response in Chlamydomonas .
Evaluation of the Virus Counter ( R ) for rapid baculovirus quantitation .
The utility of a new instrument for rapid virus quantitation , the Virus Counter , was evaluated in a blind study conducted at three sites .
This instrument is a substantially improved version of the original academic research instrument described previously by Stoffel and Rowlen ( 2005a ) .
The addition of hydrodynamic focusing , a self - contained fluidics system and customized software for system control and data analysis has resulted in a commercially viable and available design .
Baculovirus samples were provided by Protein Sciences Corporation and blinded to InDevR and Baylor College of Medicine .
Protein Sciences Corporation and Baylor College of Medicine analyzed the samples by plaque assay and InDevR analyzed the samples using the Virus Counter .
Serial dilution of stock viruses into growth media and buffer allowed for comparison of measured versus intended concentrations .
Direct log - scale comparison between pooled Virus Counter results and pooled plaque assay results indicated a linear relationship ( slope = 1 . 1 + / - 0 . 2 , R ( 2 ) = 0 . 86 ) with statistically significant Pearson correlation ( r = 0 . 93 , p & lt ; 0 . 001 ) .
Applied biotechnology for production of immunoglobulin Y specific to hepatitis:__entity__ A:__entity__ virus:__entity__ .
A new protocol for producing polyclonal antibody against hepatitis:__entity__ A:__entity__ virus:__entity__ ( HAV:__entity__ ) is described .
Twenty hens:__entity__ were immunized three times with a commercial HAV:__entity__ vaccine and HAV:__entity__ from a cell culture with three types of adjuvants : CpG oligodeoxynucleotides ( CpG - ODN ) , incomplete Freund ' s adjuvant and an alum adjuvant .
In each of the last two booster inoculations , blood from the birds was collected and tested for HAV:__entity__ antibodies .
Egg yolk was separated from egg white and immunoglobulin Y ( IgY ) antibody was then purified by polyethylene glycol 6000 .
The mean yield of total protein in yolk was 22 . 62 mg / mL .
Specific activity of the antibody was tested using commercial ELISA , Western blotting , and in vitro neutralization assay demonstrating that anti - HAV:__entity__ IgY bound specifically .
After the first immunization , birds immunized with HAV:__entity__ from cell culture plus incomplete Freund ' s adjuvant with / without CpG - ODN showed highest levels of anti - HAV:__entity__ IgY in serum ( p & lt ; 0 . 05 ) .
Viral combination with CpG - ODN resulted in early response of anti - HAV:__entity__ serum in hens:__entity__ , reflecting the amount of IgY transferred to the egg yolk ( p & lt ; 0 . 05 ) .
The results suggest that egg yolk may be a large scale source of specific antibodies against hepatitis:__entity__ A:__entity__ virus:__entity__ .
Further applications of this method have yet to be tested .
Cotterillia:__entity__ bromelicola:__entity__ nov:__entity__ .:__entity__ gen:__entity__ .:__entity__ ,:__entity__ nov:__entity__ .:__entity__ spec:__entity__ .:__entity__ , a gonostomatid ciliate ( Ciliophora , Hypotricha ) from tank bromeliads ( Bromeliaceae ) with de novo originating dorsal kineties .
Cotterillia:__entity__ bromelicola:__entity__ nov:__entity__ .:__entity__ gen:__entity__ .:__entity__ ,:__entity__ nov:__entity__ .:__entity__ spec:__entity__ .:__entity__
was discovered in the tanks of the Mexican bromeliad Tillandsia:__entity__ heterophylla:__entity__ .
Its morphology , ontogenesis , and 18S rDNA were studied with standard methods .
Cotterillia:__entity__ has many cirral rows on both sides of the body .
Uniquely , and thus used to diagnose the new genus Cotterillia:__entity__ , it has dorsal kineties originating de novo , producing neokinetal waves where the parental dorsal kineties reorganize to & quot ; combined rows & quot ; , consisting of dorsal bristles anteriorly and of cirri posteriorly .
Thus , up to four generations of bristles and cirri occur on the dorsal body surface .
Cotterillia:__entity__ bromelicola:__entity__ has a gonostomatid body and adoral zone of membranelles , while the dense ciliature and the neokinetal waves resemble kahliellid hypotrichs .
However , the de novo origin of anlage 1 and the molecular analyses show convincingly that Cotterillia:__entity__ belongs to the Gonostomatidae Small and Lynn , 1985 , for which an improved diagnosis is provided .
Thus , neokinetal waves originated several times independently .
The molecular differences between Trachelostyla , Gonostomum , and Cotterillia:__entity__ are small ( = < 5 % ) compared to their distinct morphologies and ontogeneses , suggesting that the 18S rDNA underestimates generic diversity .
Our study emphasizes the need of combined morphological , ontogenetic , and molecular investigations to unravel the complex phylogeny and evolution of hypotrich ciliates .
The nodulation of alfalfa by the acid - tolerant Rhizobium:__entity__ sp:__entity__ .:__entity__ strain:__entity__ LPU83:__entity__ does not require sulfated forms of lipochitooligosaccharide nodulation signals .
The induction of root nodules by the majority of rhizobia has a strict requirement for the secretion of symbiosis - specific lipochitooligosaccharides ( nodulation factors [ NFs ] ) .
The nature of the chemical substitution on the NFs depends on the particular rhizobium and contributes to the host specificity imparted by the NFs .
We present here a description of the genetic organization of the nod gene cluster and the characterization of the chemical structure of the NFs associated with the broad - host - range Rhizobium:__entity__ sp:__entity__ .:__entity__ strain:__entity__ LPU83:__entity__ , a bacterium capable of nodulating at least alfalfa:__entity__ , bean , and Leucena:__entity__ leucocephala:__entity__ .
The nod gene cluster was located on the plasmid pLPU83b .
The organization of the cluster showed synteny with those of the alfalfa:__entity__ - nodulating rhizobia , Sinorhizobium:__entity__ meliloti:__entity__ and Sinorhizobium:__entity__ medicae:__entity__ .
Interestingly , the strongest sequence similarity observed was between the partial nod sequences of Rhizobium:__entity__ mongolense:__entity__ USDA:__entity__ 1844:__entity__ and the corresponding LPU83:__entity__ nod genes sequences .
The phylogenetic analysis of the intergenic region nodEG positions strain LPU83:__entity__ and the type strain R:__entity__ .:__entity__ mongolense:__entity__ 1844:__entity__ in the same branch , which indicates that Rhizobium:__entity__ sp:__entity__ .:__entity__ strain:__entity__ LPU83:__entity__ might represent an early alfalfa:__entity__ - nodulating genotype .
The NF chemical structures obtained for the wild - type strain consist of a trimeric , tetrameric , and pentameric chitin backbone that shares some substitutions with both alfalfa - and bean - nodulating rhizobia .
Remarkably , while in strain LPU83:__entity__ most of the NFs were sulfated in their reducing terminal residue , none of the NFs isolated from the nodH mutant LPU83:__entity__ -:__entity__ H:__entity__ were sulfated .
The evidence obtained supports the notion that the sulfate decoration of NFs in LPU83:__entity__ is not necessary for alfalfa:__entity__ nodulation .
The Rcs signal transduction pathway is triggered by enterobacterial common antigen structure alterations in Serratia:__entity__ marcescens:__entity__ .
The enterobacterial common antigen ( ECA ) is a highly conserved exopolysaccharide in Gram - negative bacteria whose role remains largely uncharacterized .
In a previous work , we have demonstrated that disrupting the integrity of the ECA biosynthetic pathway imposed severe deficiencies to the Serratia:__entity__ marcescens:__entity__ motile ( swimming and swarming ) capacity .
In this work , we show that alterations in the ECA structure activate the Rcs phosphorelay , which results in the repression of the flagellar biogenesis regulatory cascade .
In addition , a detailed analysis of wec cluster mutant strains , which provoke the disruption of the ECA biosynthesis at different levels of the pathway , suggests that the absence of the periplasmic ECA cyclic structure could constitute a potential signal detected by the RcsF - RcsCDB phosphorelay .
We also identify SMA1167 as a member of the S:__entity__ .:__entity__ marcescens:__entity__ Rcs regulon and show that high osmolarity induces Rcs activity in this bacterium .
These results provide a new perspective from which to understand the phylogenetic conservation of ECA among enterobacteria and the basis for the virulence attenuation detected in wec mutant strains in other pathogenic bacteria .
A cis - encoded antisense small RNA regulated by the HP0165 - HP0166 two - component system controls expression of ureB in Helicobacter:__entity__ pylori:__entity__ .
Expression of urease is essential for gastric colonization by Helicobacter:__entity__ pylori:__entity__ .
The increased level of urease in gastric acidity is due , in part , to acid activation of the two - component system ( TCS ) consisting of the membrane sensor HP0165 and its response regulator , HP0166 , which regulates transcription of the seven genes of the urease gene cluster .
We now find that there are two major ureAB transcripts : a 2 . 7 - kb full - length ureAB transcript and a 1 . 4 - kb truncated transcript lacking 3 ' ureB .
Acidic pH ( pH 4 . 5 ) results in a significant increase in transcription of ureAB , while neutral pH ( pH 7 . 4 ) increases the truncated 1 . 4 - kb transcript .
Northern blot analysis with sense RNA and strand - specific oligonucleotide probes followed by 5 ' rapid amplification of cDNA ends detects an antisense small RNA ( sRNA ) encoded by the 5 ' ureB noncoding strand consisting of - 290 nucleotides ( 5 ' ureB - sRNA ) .
Deletion of HP0165 elevates the level of the truncated 1 . 4 - kb transcript along with that of the 5 ' ureB - sRNA at both pH 7 . 4 and pH 4 . 5 .
Overexpression of 5 ' ureB - sRNA increases the 1 . 4 - kb transcript , decreases the 2 . 7 - kb transcript , and decreases urease activity .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay shows that unphosphorylated HP0166 binds specifically to the 5 ' ureB - sRNA promoter .
The ability of the HP0165 - HP0166 TCS to both increase and decrease ureB expression at low and high pHs , respectively , facilitates gastric habitation and colonization over the wide range of intragastric pHs experienced by the organism .
Non - structural protein 1 ( NS1 ) antibody - based assays to differentiate West:__entity__ Nile:__entity__ ( WN ) virus from Japanese encephalitis virus infections in horses : effects of WN:__entity__ virus:__entity__ NS1 antibodies induced by inactivated WN vaccine .
Antibodies to non - structural protein 1 ( NS1 ) of West Nile virus ( WNV ) have been used to differentiate WNV infection from infection by serologically cross - reactive flaviviruses , including Japanese:__entity__ encephalitis:__entity__ virus:__entity__ ( JEV ) , in horses .
However , since the inactivated West Nile ( WN:__entity__ ) vaccine has been reported to induce NS1 antibodies , there is concern about the reliability of using NS1 - based assays for testing vaccinated horses .
Therefore , the effect of inactivated WN:__entity__ vaccine - induced antibodies on an epitope - blocking ELISA and complement - dependent cytotoxicity ( CDC ) assay were investigated .
Both assays are based on NS1 antibodies and were established previously to differentiate WNV:__entity__ from JEV infections in horses .
Groups of three horses were vaccinated with two or three doses of a commercial inactivated WN vaccine and NS1 antibodies were detected by a conventional ELISA after the second vaccination .
Vaccine - induced NS1 antibodies were also detected by blocking ELISA and a CDC assay and affected the ability of these assays to differentiate WNV:__entity__ from JEV:__entity__ infections .
However , the effect was less significant in the CDC assay , where use of a low serum concentration ensured effective differentiation .
The more efficient detection of infection - induced antibodies over vaccine - induced antibodies by the CDC assay was potentially attributable to the different IgG isotype profiles of these antibodies .
The B cell response is redundant and highly focused on V1V2 during early subtype C infection in a Zambian seroconverter .
High - titer autologous neutralizing antibody responses have been demonstrated during early subtype C human:__entity__ immunodeficiency:__entity__ virus:__entity__ type:__entity__ 1:__entity__ ( HIV:__entity__ -:__entity__ 1:__entity__ ) infection .
However , characterization of this response against autologous virus at the monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) level has only recently begun to be elucidated .
Here we describe five monoclonal antibodies derived from a subtype C - infected seroconverter and their neutralizing activities against pseudoviruses that carry envelope glycoproteins from 48 days ( 0 month ) , 2 months , and 8 months after the estimated time of infection .
Sequence analysis indicated that the MAbs arose from three distinct B cell clones , and their pattern of neutralization compared to that in patient plasma suggested that they circulated between 2 and 8 months after infection .
Neutralization by MAbs representative of each B cell clone was mapped to two residues : position 134 in V1 and position 189 in V2 .
Mutational analysis revealed cooperative effects between glycans and residues at these two positions , arguing that they contribute to a single epitope .
Analysis of the cognate gp120 sequence through homology modeling places this potential epitope near the interface between the V1 and V2 loops .
Additionally , the escape mutation R189S in V2 , which conferred resistance against all three MAbs , had no detrimental effect on virus replication in vitro .
Taken together , our data demonstrate that independent B cells repeatedly targeted a single structure in V1V2 during early infection .
Despite this assault , a single amino acid change was sufficient to confer complete escape with minimal impact on replication fitness .
A nuclear inhibitor of NF - kappaB encoded by a poxvirus .
Poxviruses have evolved various strategies to inhibit cytoplasmic events leading to activation of the nuclear factor kappaB ( NF - kappaB ) signaling pathway , with individual viruses often encoding multiple NF - kappaB inhibitors .
Here , the novel orf:__entity__ virus:__entity__ ( ORFV:__entity__ ) - encoded protein ORFV002:__entity__ was shown to inhibit nuclear events regulating NF - kappaB transcriptional activity .
ORFV002 expression in cell cultures significantly decreased wild - type - virus - , tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF - alpha ) - , and lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) - induced NF - kappaB - mediated gene expression .
Expression of ORFV002 in cells , while not affecting phosphorylation or nuclear translocation of NF - kappaB - p65 , markedly decreased TNF - alpha - and wild - type - virus - induced acetylation of NF - kappaB - p65 , a p300 - mediated nuclear modification of NF - kappaB - p65 that regulates its transactivating activity .
ORFV002 was shown to colocalize and interact with NF - kappaB - p65 , and expression of ORFV002 in cell cultures resulted in a reduced interaction of NF - kappaB - p65 with p300 , suggesting that ORFV002 interferes with NF - kappaB - p65 / p300 association .
Deletion of ORFV002 from the OV - IA82 genome had no significant effect on ORFV pathogenesis in sheep , indicating that ORFV002 is nonessential for virus virulence in the natural host .
This represents the first description of a nuclear inhibitor of NF - kappaB encoded by a poxvirus .
Norovirus GII . 4 strain antigenic variation .
Noroviruses are the principal cause of epidemic gastroenteritis worldwide .
Multiple reports have concluded that the major capsid proteins of GII . 4 strains , which cause 80 % of norovirus infections worldwide , are evolving rapidly , resulting in new epidemic strains .
Surrogate neutralization assays using sera from outbreaks and from immunized mice suggest that , as with influenza:__entity__ virus:__entity__ , antigenic variation maintains GII . 4 persistence in the face of human:__entity__ population herd immunity .
To test this hypothesis , mice were hyperimmunized with virus - like particles ( VLPs ) representing an early ( GII . 4 - 1987 ) and a contemporary ( GII . 4 - 2006 ) GII . 4 strain .
Anti - GII . 4 - 1987 IgG monoclonal antibodies ( MAbs ) strongly reacted with GII . 4 VLPs derived between only 1987 and 2002 .
Ligand binding blockade was more efficient with GII . 4 - 1987 and GII . 4 - 1997 VLPs than with GII . 4 - 2002 .
Anti - GII . 4 - 2006 IgG MAbs recognized either a broad panel of GII . 4 VLPs ( 1987 to 2006 ) or a subset of contemporary ( 2004 to 2006 ) VLPs .
Most 2006 antibodies did not recognize or only poorly recognized GII . 4 VLPs of 2007 or 2008 , documenting rapid antigenic evolution of GII . 4 capsids .
Generally , 2006 MAbs blocked homotypic VLP - ligand binding but were unable to block VLPs representing strains primarily circulating during or earlier than 2002 .
These analyses demonstrate that both subtle and significant evolutionary change has occurred within antibody epitopes between epidemic strains , providing direct evidence that the GII . 4 noroviruses are undergoing antigenic variation , likely in response to herd immunity .
As with influenza:__entity__ virus:__entity__ , HIV , and hepatitis:__entity__ C:__entity__ virus:__entity__ , norovirus antigenic variation will significantly influence the design of efficacious vaccines and immunotherapeutics against these important human:__entity__ pathogens .
Dominant inhibition of Akt / protein kinase B signaling by the matrix protein of a negative - strand RNA virus .
Vesicular:__entity__ stomatitis:__entity__ virus:__entity__ ( VSV:__entity__ ) is a rhabdovirus that alters host nuclear and cytoplasmic function upon infection .
We have investigated the effect of VSV:__entity__ infection on cellular signaling through the phosphatidylinositol - 3 kinase ( PI3k ) / Akt signaling pathway .
Akt phosphorylation at both threonine 308 ( Thr308 ) and serine 473 ( Ser473 ) was inhibited in cells infected with VSV:__entity__ .
This inhibition was rapid ( beginning within the first 2 to 3 h postinfection ) and correlated with the dephosphorylation of downstream effectors of Akt , such as glycogen synthase kinase 3Beta ( GSK3Beta ) and mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) .
The dephosphorylation of Akt occurred in the presence of growth factor stimulation and was not overcome through constitutive membrane targeting of Akt or high levels of phosphatidylinositol - 3 , 4 , 5 - triphosphate ( PIP3 ) accumulation in the membrane .
Akt dephosphorylation was not a result of alterations in PDK1 phosphorylation or activity , changes in phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 ( PTEN ) levels , or the downregulation of PI3k signaling .
Inactivation of Akt was caused by the expression of the viral M protein in the absence of other viral components , and an M protein mutant that does not inhibit RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ) transcription and nuclear / cytoplasmic transport was also defective in inhibiting Akt phosphorylation .
These data illustrate that VSV:__entity__ utilizes a novel mechanism to alter this central player in cell signaling and oncogenesis .
It also suggests an inside - out model of signal transduction where VSV:__entity__ interruption of nuclear events has a rapid and significant effect on membrane signaling events .
Activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells by Kaposi:__entity__ ':__entity__ s:__entity__ sarcoma:__entity__ -:__entity__ associated:__entity__ herpesvirus:__entity__ .
Kaposi:__entity__ ':__entity__ s:__entity__ sarcoma:__entity__ -:__entity__ associated:__entity__ herpesvirus:__entity__ ( KSHV:__entity__ ) is associated with multiple human:__entity__ malignancies , including Kaposi ' s sarcoma , primary effusion lymphoma , and multicentric Castleman ' s disease .
Following primary infection , KSHV:__entity__ typically goes through a brief period of lytic replication prior to the establishment of latency .
Plasmacytoid dendritic cells ( pDCs ) are the major producers of type 1 interferon ( IFN ) , primarily in response to virus infection .
Toll - like receptors ( TLRs ) are key components of the innate immune system , and they serve as pathogen recognition receptors that stimulate the host antiviral response .
pDCs express exclusively TLR7 and TLR9 , and it is through these TLRs that the type 1 interferon response is activated in pDCs .
Currently , it is not known whether KSHV:__entity__ is recognized by pDCs and whether activation of pDCs occurs in response to KSHV:__entity__ infection .
We now report evidence that KSHV:__entity__ can infect human:__entity__ pDCs and that pDCs are activated upon KSHV:__entity__ infection , as measured by upregulation of CD83 and CD86 and by IFN - alpha secretion .
We further show that induction of IFN - alpha occurs through activation of TLR9 signaling and that a TLR9 inhibitor diminishes the production and secretion of IFN - alpha by KSHV:__entity__ - infected pDCs .
An in - depth analysis of original antigenic sin in dengue:__entity__ virus:__entity__ infection .
The evolution of dengue:__entity__ viruses:__entity__ has resulted in four antigenically similar yet distinct serotypes .
Infection with one serotype likely elicits lifelong immunity to that serotype , but generally not against the other three .
Secondary or sequential infections are common , as multiple viral serotypes frequently cocirculate .
Dengue:__entity__ infection , although frequently mild , can lead to dengue:__entity__ hemorrhagic fever ( DHF ) which can be life threatening .
DHF is more common in secondary dengue:__entity__ infections , implying a role for the adaptive immune response in the disease .
There is currently much effort toward the design and implementation of a dengue vaccine but these efforts are made more difficult by the challenge of inducing durable neutralizing immunity to all four viruses .
Domain 3 of the dengue:__entity__ virus:__entity__ envelope protein ( ED3 ) has been suggested as one such candidate because it contains neutralizing epitopes and it was originally thought that relatively few cross - reactive antibodies are directed to this domain .
In this study , we performed a detailed analysis of the anti - ED3 response in a cohort of patients suffering either primary or secondary dengue:__entity__ infections .
The results show dramatic evidence of original antigenic sin in secondary infections both in terms of binding and enhancement activity .
This has important implications for dengue:__entity__ vaccine design because heterologous boosting is likely to maintain the immunological footprint of the first vaccination .
On the basis of these findings , we propose a simple in vitro enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) to diagnose the original dengue:__entity__ infection in secondary dengue:__entity__ cases .
When it is too hot for photosynthesis : heat - induced instability of photosynthesis in relation to respiratory burst , cell permeability changes and H2O2 formation .
Photosynthesis rate ( A ( n ) ) becomes unstable above a threshold temperature , and the recovery upon return to low temperature varies because of reasons not fully understood .
We investigated responses of A ( n ) , dark respiration and chlorophyll fluorescence to supraoptimal temperatures of varying duration and kinetics in Phaseolus:__entity__ vulgaris:__entity__ asking whether the instability of photosynthesis under severe heat stress is associated with cellular damage .
Cellular damage was assessed by Evans blue penetration ( enhanced membrane permeability ) and by H2O2 generation [ 3 , 3 ' - diaminobenzidine 4HCl ( DAB ) - staining ] .
Critical temperature for dark fluorescence ( F ( 0 ) ) rise ( T ( F ) ) was at 46 - 48 ^ 0C , and a burst of respiration was observed near T ( F ) .
However , A ( n ) was strongly inhibited already before T ( F ) was reached .
Membrane permeability increased with temperature according to a switch - type response , with enhanced permeability observed above 48 ^ 0C .
Experiments with varying heat pulse lengths and intensities underscored the threshold - type loss of photosynthetic function , and indicated that the degree of photosynthetic deterioration and cellular damage depended on accumulated heat - dose .
Beyond the ' point of no return ' , propagation of cellular damage and reduction of photosynthesis continued upon transfer to lower temperatures and photosynthetic recovery was slow or absent .
We conclude that instability of photosynthesis under severe heat stress is associated with time - dependent propagation of cellular lesions .
A fluorescence resonance energy transfer - based fluorometer assay for screening anti - coxsackievirus:__entity__ B3:__entity__ compounds .
In view of the need to develop a simple and rapid method to screen for antiviral therapeutic agents , a fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) - based reporter system consisting of engineered mammalian cells expressing a cyan fluorescent protein - yellow fluorescent protein ( CFP - YFP ) pair linked by a short peptide containing the cleavage site of viral protease 2A ( 2A ( pro ) ) was developed .
By detecting the 2A ( pro ) produced early during the virus infection cycle , the CFP - YFP pair effectively identifies infectious coxsackievirus:__entity__ B3:__entity__ ( CVB3:__entity__ ) , a picornavirus that causes viral myocarditis in humans:__entity__ .
The reporter system was used to screen a library of 2000 drugs and natural products for potential antiviral compounds .
The reporter cells were treated with the test compounds , challenged with CVB3:__entity__ , and then examined using a fluorometer at 24h post - infection .
Sixty - four compounds , mostly therapeutic drugs , antimicrobial compounds and compounds with unknown functions , caused at least 50 % inhibition of 2A ( pro ) activity .
Three known antiviral compounds , cosmosiin , ribavirin and baicalein , were also identified in the screening .
The developed method is an effective strategy for rapid screening , and identifies compounds that inhibit CVB3:__entity__ 2A ( pro ) .
This method should be a valuable aid in the antiviral drug discovery effort .
One - step real - time reverse transcription - PCR assays for detecting and subtyping pandemic:__entity__ influenza:__entity__ A:__entity__ /:__entity__ H1N1:__entity__ 2009:__entity__ , seasonal:__entity__ influenza:__entity__ A:__entity__ /:__entity__ H1N1:__entity__ , and seasonal:__entity__ influenza:__entity__ A:__entity__ /:__entity__ H3N2:__entity__ viruses:__entity__ .
Pandemic:__entity__ influenza:__entity__ A:__entity__ /:__entity__ H1N1:__entity__ 2009:__entity__ (:__entity__ A:__entity__ /:__entity__ H1N1pdm:__entity__ ):__entity__ virus:__entity__ has caused significant outbreaks worldwide .
A previous one - step real - time reverse transcription - PCR ( rRT - PCR ) assay for detecting A:__entity__ /:__entity__ H1N1pdm:__entity__ virus:__entity__ ( H1pdm rRT - PCR assay ) was improved since the former probe had a low melting temperature and low tolerance to viral mutation .
To help with the screening of the A:__entity__ /:__entity__ H1N1pdm:__entity__ virus:__entity__ , rRT - PCR assays were also developed for detecting human:__entity__ seasonal:__entity__ A:__entity__ /:__entity__ H1N1:__entity__ ( H1 rRT - PCR assay ) and A:__entity__ /:__entity__ H3N2:__entity__ influenza:__entity__ viruses:__entity__ ( H3 rRT - PCR assay ) .
H1pdm , H1 , and H3 rRT - PCR assays were evaluated using in vitro - transcribed control RNA , isolated viruses , and other respiratory pathogenic viruses , and were shown to have high sensitivity , good linearity ( R ( 2 ) = 0 . 99 ) , and high specificity .
In addition , the improved H1pdm rRT - PCR assay could detect two viral:__entity__ strains:__entity__ of:__entity__ A:__entity__ /:__entity__ H1N1pdm:__entity__ , namely , A:__entity__ /:__entity__ Aichi:__entity__ /:__entity__ 472:__entity__ /:__entity__ 2009:__entity__ (:__entity__ H1N1:__entity__ ):__entity__ pdm:__entity__ and A:__entity__ /:__entity__ Sakai:__entity__ /:__entity__ 89:__entity__ /:__entity__ 2009:__entity__ (:__entity__ H1N1:__entity__ ):__entity__ pdm:__entity__ , which have mutation ( s ) in the probe - binding region of the hemagglutinin gene , without loss of sensitivity .
Using the three rRT - PCR assays developed , 90 clinical specimens collected between May and October 2009 were then tested .
Of these , 26 , 20 , and 2 samples were identified as positive for A:__entity__ /:__entity__ H1pdm:__entity__ , A:__entity__ /:__entity__ H3:__entity__ , and A:__entity__ /:__entity__ H1:__entity__ , respectively , while 42 samples were negative for influenza:__entity__ A:__entity__ viruses:__entity__ .
The present results suggest that these highly sensitive and specific H1pdm , H1 , and H3 rRT - PCR assays are useful not only for diagnosing influenza:__entity__ viruses:__entity__ , but also for the surveillance of influenza:__entity__ viruses:__entity__ .
Comparison of commercial systems for extraction of nucleic acids from DNA / RNA respiratory pathogens .
This study compared six automated nucleic acid extraction systems and one manual kit for their ability to recover nucleic acids from human:__entity__ nasal wash specimens spiked with five respiratory pathogens , representing Gram - positive bacteria ( Streptococcus:__entity__ pyogenes:__entity__ ) , Gram - negative bacteria ( Legionella:__entity__ pneumophila:__entity__ ) , DNA viruses ( adenovirus ) , segmented RNA viruses ( human:__entity__ influenza:__entity__ virus:__entity__ A:__entity__ ) , and non - segmented RNA viruses ( respiratory:__entity__ syncytial:__entity__ virus:__entity__ ) .
The robots and kit evaluated represent major commercially available methods that are capable of simultaneous extraction of DNA and RNA from respiratory specimens , and included platforms based on magnetic - bead technology ( KingFisher mL , Biorobot EZ1 , easyMAG , KingFisher Flex , and MagNA Pure Compact ) or glass fiber filter technology ( Biorobot MDX and the manual kit Allprep ) .
All methods yielded extracts free of cross - contamination and RT - PCR inhibition .
All automated systems recovered L:__entity__ .:__entity__ pneumophila:__entity__ and adenovirus DNA equivalently .
However , the MagNA Pure protocol demonstrated more than 4 - fold higher DNA recovery from the S:__entity__ .:__entity__ pyogenes:__entity__ than other methods .
The KingFisher mL and easyMAG protocols provided 1 - to 3 - log wider linearity and extracted 3 - to 4 - fold more RNA from the human:__entity__ influenza:__entity__ virus:__entity__ and respiratory:__entity__ syncytial:__entity__ virus:__entity__ .
These findings suggest that systems differed in nucleic acid recovery , reproducibility , and linearity in a pathogen specific manner .
Aerosol drug delivery : developments in device design and clinical use .
Aerosolised drugs are prescribed for use in a range of inhaler devices and systems .
Delivering drugs by inhalation requires a formulation that can be successfully aerosolised and a delivery system that produces a useful aerosol of the drug ; the particles or droplets need to be of sufficient size and mass to be carried to the distal lung or deposited on proximal airways to give rise to a therapeutic effect .
Patients and caregivers must use and maintain these aerosol drug delivery devices correctly .
In recent years , several technical innovations have led to aerosol drug delivery devices with efficient drug delivery and with novel features that take into account factors such as dose tracking , portability , materials of manufacture , breath actuation , the interface with the patient , combination therapies , and systemic delivery .
These changes have improved performance in all four categories of devices : metered dose inhalers , spacers and holding chambers , dry powder inhalers , and nebulisers .
Additionally , several therapies usually given by injection are now prescribed as aerosols for use in a range of drug delivery devices .
In this Review , we discuss recent developments in the design and clinical use of aerosol devices over the past 10 - 15 years with an emphasis on the treatment of respiratory disorders .
Regulation of horizontal gene transfer in Bacillus:__entity__ subtilis:__entity__ by activation of a conserved site - specific protease .
The mobile genetic element ICEBs1 is an integrative and conjugative element ( a conjugative transposon ) found in Bacillus:__entity__ subtilis:__entity__ .
The RecA - dependent SOS response and the RapI - PhrI cell sensory system activate ICEBs1 gene expression by stimulating cleavage of ImmR , the ICEBs1 immunity repressor , by the protease ImmA .
We found that increasing the amount of wild - type ImmA in vivo caused partial derepression of ICEBs1 gene expression .
However , during RapI - mediated derepression of ICEBs1 gene expression , ImmA levels did not detectably increase , indicating that RapI likely activates the protease ImmA by increasing its specific activity .
We also isolated and characterized mutations in immA ( immA ( h ) ) that cause partial derepression of ICEBs1 gene expression in the absence of inducing signals .
We obtained two types of immA ( h ) mutations : one type caused increased amounts of the mutant proteins in vivo but no detectable effect on specific activity in vitro ; the other type had no detectable effect on the amount of the mutant protein in vivo but caused increased specific activity of the protein ( as measured in vitro ) .
Together , these findings indicate that derepression of ICEBs1 gene expression is likely caused by an increase in the specific activity of ImmA .
Homologs of ImmA and ImmR are found in many mobile genetic elements , so the mechanisms that regulate ImmA - mediated cleavage of ImmR may be widely conserved .
Orientation of SecA and SecB in complex , derived from disulfide cross - linking .
SecA is the ATPase that acts as the motor for protein export in the general secretory , or Sec , system of Escherichia:__entity__ coli:__entity__ .
The tetrameric cytoplasmic chaperone SecB binds to precursors of exported proteins before they can become stably folded and delivers them to SecA .
During this delivery step , SecB binds to SecA .
The complex between SecA and SecB that is maximally active in translocation contains two protomers of SecA bound to a tetramer of SecB .
The aminoacyl residues on each protein that are involved in binding the other have previously been identified by site - directed spin labeling and electron paramagnetic resonance ( EPR ) spectroscopy ; however , that study provided no information concerning the relative orientation of the proteins within the complex .
Here we used our extensive collection of single - cysteine variants of the two proteins and subjected pairwise combinations of SecA and SecB to brief oxidation to identify residues in close proximity .
These data were used to generate a model for the orientation of the two proteins within the complex .
Inactivation of the RluD pseudouridine synthase has minimal effects on growth and ribosome function in wild - type Escherichia:__entity__ coli:__entity__ and Salmonella:__entity__ enterica:__entity__ .
The Escherichia:__entity__ coli:__entity__ rluD gene encodes a pseudouridine synthase responsible for the pseudouridine ( Psi ) modifications at positions 1911 , 1915 , and 1917 in helix 69 of 23S rRNA .
It has been reported that deletion of rluD in K:__entity__ -:__entity__ 12:__entity__ strains:__entity__ of:__entity__ E:__entity__ .:__entity__ coli:__entity__ is associated with extremely slow growth , increased readthrough of stop codons , and defects in 50S ribosomal subunit assembly and 30S - 50S subunit association .
Suppressor mutations in the prfB and prfC genes encoding release factor 2 ( RF2 ) and RF3 that restore the wild type - growth rate and also correct the ribosomal defects have now been isolated .
These suppressors link helix 69 Psi residues with the termination phase of protein synthesis .
However , further genetic analysis reported here also reveals that the slow growth and other defects associated with inactivation of rluD in E:__entity__ .:__entity__ coli:__entity__ K:__entity__ -:__entity__ 12:__entity__ strains are due to a defective RF2 protein , with a threonine at position 246 , which is present in all K:__entity__ -:__entity__ 12:__entity__ strains .
This is in contrast to the more typical alanine found at this position in most bacterial RF2s , including those of other E:__entity__ .:__entity__ coli:__entity__ strains .
Inactivation of rluD in E:__entity__ .:__entity__ coli:__entity__ strains containing the prfB allele from E:__entity__ .:__entity__ coli:__entity__ B:__entity__ or in Salmonella:__entity__ enterica:__entity__ , both carrying an RF2 with Ala246 , has negligible effects on growth , termination , or ribosome function .
The results indicate that , in contrast to those in wild bacteria , termination functions in E:__entity__ .:__entity__ coli:__entity__ K:__entity__ -:__entity__ 12:__entity__ strains carrying a partially defective RF2 protein are especially susceptible to perturbation of ribosome - RF interactions , such as that caused by loss of h69 Psi modifications .
Effect of energetic constraints on distribution and winter survival of weasel males .
1 .
The absolute energy needs of small animals are generally lower than those of larger animals .
This should drive higher mortality of larger animals , when the environmental conditions deteriorate .
However , demonstration of the effect of energy constraints on survivals proved difficult , because the range of body mass within species is generally too small to produce enough variation for studying such an effect .
An opportunity for an intraspecific study comes from weasels inhabiting the Bialowieza Forest ( north - eastern Poland ) , which are characterized by a threefold variation in body mass .
2 .
We assumed that in summer larger weasel males are favoured by sexual selection , because they are more successful when competing for mates .
We then tested whether they suffer higher mortality in winter , because they have difficulty finding sufficient food to satisfy their energy needs and / or because the additional foraging time would result in increased exposure to predation .
3 .
We measured daily energy expenditures ( DEE ) of overwintering weasel males using the doubly labelled water ( DLW ) technique .
We constructed an energetic model predicting how individuals of different size are able to balance their energy budgets feeding on large and small prey while minimizing time spent hunting , thereby reducing their own exposure to predation .
4 .
The range of body mass in overwintering weasels predicted by our model corresponded very well with the distribution of prey body mass in three different habitats within our study area .
Larger individuals were able to compensate for higher food requirements by using habitats with larger prey species than those available to smaller male weasels .
This effectively offset the expected negative association between body mass and winter survival predicted from considerations of energy balance .
5 .
Our results show how energetic constraints affect body mass and spatial segregation of a species at the intra - specific level not only across large geographical ranges , but also within a relatively small area .
Bud set in poplar - - genetic dissection of a complex trait in natural and hybrid populations .
* The seasonal timing of growth events is crucial to tree distribution and conservation .
The seasonal growth cycle is strongly adapted to the local climate that is changing because of global warming .
We studied bud set as one cornerstone of the seasonal growth cycle in an integrative approach .
* Bud set was dissected at the phenotypic level into several components , and phenotypic components with most genetic variation were identified .
While phenotypic variation resided in the timing of growth cessation , and even so more in the duration from growth cessation to bud set , the timing of growth cessation had a stronger genetic component in both natural and hybrid populations .
* Quantitative trait loci ( QTL ) were identified for the most discriminative phenotypic bud - set components across four poplar pedigrees .
The QTL from different pedigrees were recurrently detected in six regions of the poplar genome .
* These regions of 1 . 83 - 4 . 25 Mbp in size , containing between 202 and 394 genes , form the basis for further molecular - genetic dissection of bud set .
Alphacoronavirus transmissible:__entity__ gastroenteritis:__entity__ virus:__entity__ nsp1 protein suppresses protein translation in mammalian cells and in cell - free HeLa cell extracts but not in rabbit:__entity__ reticulocyte lysate .
The nsp1 protein of transmissible:__entity__ gastroenteritis:__entity__ virus:__entity__ ( TGEV:__entity__ ) , an alphacoronavirus , efficiently suppressed protein synthesis in mammalian cells .
Unlike the nsp1 protein of severe:__entity__ acute:__entity__ respiratory:__entity__ syndrome:__entity__ coronavirus:__entity__ , a betacoronavirus , the TGEV:__entity__ nsp1 protein was unable to bind 40S ribosomal subunits or promote host mRNA degradation .
TGEV:__entity__ nsp1 also suppressed protein translation in cell - free HeLa cell extract ; however , it did not affect translation in rabbit:__entity__ reticulocyte lysate ( RRL ) .
Our data suggested that HeLa cell extracts and cultured host cells , but not RRL , contain a host factor ( s ) that is essential for TGEV:__entity__ nsp1 - induced translational suppression .
Modification of nonstructural protein 1 of influenza:__entity__ A:__entity__ virus:__entity__ by SUMO1 .
Nonstructural protein 1 ( NS1 ) is one of the major factors resulting in the efficient infection rate and high level of virulence of influenza:__entity__ A:__entity__ virus:__entity__ .
Although consisting of only approximately 230 amino acids , NS1 has the ability to interfere with several systems of the host viral defense .
In the present study , we demonstrate that NS1 of the highly pathogenic avian influenza:__entity__ A:__entity__ /:__entity__ Duck:__entity__ /:__entity__ Hubei:__entity__ /:__entity__ L:__entity__ -:__entity__ 1:__entity__ /:__entity__ 2004:__entity__ (:__entity__ H5N1:__entity__ ):__entity__ virus:__entity__ interacts with human:__entity__ Ubc9 , which is the E2 conjugating enzyme for sumoylation , and we show that SUMO1 is conjugated to H5N1:__entity__ NS1 in both transfected and infected cells .
Furthermore , two lysine residues in the C terminus of NS1 were identified as SUMO1 acceptor sites .
When the SUMO1 acceptor sites were removed by mutation , NS1 underwent rapid degradation .
Studies of different influenza:__entity__ A:__entity__ virus:__entity__ strains of human:__entity__ and avian origin showed that the majority of viruses possess an NS1 protein that is modified by SUMO1 , except for the recently emerged swine:__entity__ -:__entity__ origin:__entity__ influenza:__entity__ A:__entity__ virus:__entity__ (:__entity__ S:__entity__ -:__entity__ OIV:__entity__ ):__entity__ (:__entity__ H1N1:__entity__ ):__entity__ .
Interestingly , growth of a sumoylation - deficient WSN virus mutant was retarded compared to that of wild - type virus .
Together , these results indicate that sumoylation enhances NS1 stability and thus promotes rapid growth of influenza:__entity__ A:__entity__ virus:__entity__ .
Acclimation to high CO2 in maize:__entity__ is related to water status and dependent on leaf rank .
The responses of C ( 3 ) plants to rising atmospheric CO ( 2 ) levels are considered to be largely dependent on effects exerted through altered photosynthesis .
In contrast , the nature of the responses of C ( 4 ) plants to high CO ( 2 ) remains controversial because of the absence of CO ( 2 ) - dependent effects on photosynthesis .
In this study , the effects of atmospheric CO ( 2 ) availability on the transcriptome , proteome and metabolome profiles of two ranks of source leaves in maize:__entity__ ( Zea:__entity__ mays:__entity__ L . ) were studied in plants grown under ambient CO ( 2 ) conditions ( 350 + / - 20 muL L ( - 1 ) CO ( 2 ) ) or with CO ( 2 ) enrichment ( 700 + / - 20 muL L ( - 1 ) CO ( 2 ) ) .
Growth at high CO ( 2 ) had no effect on photosynthesis , photorespiration , leaf C / N ratios or anthocyanin contents .
However , leaf transpiration rates , carbohydrate metabolism and protein carbonyl accumulation were altered at high CO ( 2 ) in a leaf - rank specific manner .
Although no significant CO ( 2 ) - dependent changes in the leaf transcriptome were observed , qPCR analysis revealed that the abundance of transcripts encoding a Bowman - Birk protease inhibitor and a serpin were changed by the growth CO ( 2 ) level in a leaf rank specific manner .
Moreover , CO ( 2 ) - dependent changes in the leaf proteome were most evident in the oldest source leaves .
Small changes in water status may be responsible for the observed responses to high CO ( 2 , ) particularly in the older leaf ranks .
Seasonal dynamics in the stable carbon isotope composition delta ^ 1 ^ 3C from non - leafy branch , trunk and coarse root CO2 efflux of adult deciduous ( Fagus:__entity__ sylvatica:__entity__ ) and evergreen ( Picea:__entity__ abies:__entity__ ) trees .
Respiration is a substantial driver of carbon ( C ) flux in forest ecosystems and stable C isotopes provide an excellent tool for its investigation .
We studied seasonal dynamics in delta ^ 1 ^ 3C of CO2 efflux ( delta ^ 1 ^ 3C ( E ) ) from non - leafy branches , upper and lower trunks and coarse roots of adult trees , comparing deciduous Fagus:__entity__ sylvatica:__entity__ ( European:__entity__ beech:__entity__ ) with evergreen Picea:__entity__ abies:__entity__ ( Norway:__entity__ spruce:__entity__ ) .
In both species , we observed strong and similar seasonal dynamics in the delta ^ 1 ^ 3C ( E ) of above - ground plant components , whereas delta ^ 1 ^ 3C ( E ) of coarse roots was rather stable .
During summer , delta ^ 1 ^ 3C ( E ) of trunks was about - 28 . 2 % ( Beech ) and - 26 . 8 % ( Spruce ) .
During winter dormancy , delta ^ 1 ^ 3C ( E ) increased by 5 . 6 - 9 . 1 % .
The observed dynamics are likely related to a switch from growth to starch accumulation during fall and remobilization of starch , low TCA cycle activity and accumulation of malate by PEPc during winter .
The seasonal delta ^ 1 ^ 3C ( E ) pattern of branches of Beech and upper trunks of Spruce was less variable , probably because these organs were additionally supplied by winter photosynthesis .
In view of our results and pervious studies , we conclude that the pronounced increases in delta ^ 1 ^ 3C ( E ) of trunks during the winter results from interrupted access to recent photosynthates .
The atypical OmpR / PhoB response regulator ChxR from Chlamydia:__entity__ trachomatis:__entity__ forms homodimers in vivo and binds a direct repeat of nucleotide sequences .
Two - component signal transduction systems are widespread in bacteria and are essential regulatory mechanisms for many biological processes .
These systems predominantly rely on a sensor kinase to phosphorylate a response regulator for controlling activity , which is frequently transcriptional regulation .
In recent years , an increasing number of atypical response regulators have been discovered in phylogenetically diverse bacteria .
These atypical response regulators are not controlled by phosphorylation and exhibit transcriptional activity in their wild - type form .
Relatively little is known regarding the mechanisms utilized by these atypical response regulators and the conserved characteristics of these atypical response regulators .
Chlamydia spp . are medically important bacteria and encode an atypical OmpR / PhoB subfamily response regulator termed ChxR .
In this study , protein expression analysis supports that ChxR is likely exerting its effect during the middle and late stages of the chlamydial developmental cycle , stages that include the formation of infectious elementary bodies .
In the absence of detectable phosphorylation , ChxR formed homodimers in vitro and in vivo , similar to a phosphorylated OmpR / PhoB subfamily response regulator .
ChxR was demonstrated to bind to its own promoter in vivo , supporting the role of ChxR as an autoactivator .
Detailed analysis of the ChxR binding sites within its own promoter revealed a conserved cis - acting motif that includes a tandem repeat sequence .
ChxR binds specifically to each of the individual sites and exhibits a relatively large spectrum of differential affinity .
Taken together , these observations support the conclusion that ChxR , in the absence of phosphorylation , exhibits many of the characteristics of a phosphorylated ( active ) OmpR / PhoB subfamily response regulator .
Cold stress contributes to aberrant cytokinesis during male meiosis I in a wheat:__entity__ thermosensitive genic male sterile line .
The male sterility of a wheat:__entity__ thermosensitive genic male sterile ( TGMS ) line is strictly controlled by temperature .
When the TGMS line BS366 was exposed to 10 ^ 0C from the pollen mother cell stage to the meiosis stage , a few pollen grains were formed and devoid of starch .
We report here a large - scale transcriptomic study using the Affymetrix wheat:__entity__ GeneChip to follow gene expression in BS366 line anthers in response to cold stress .
Notably , many cytoskeletal signaling components were gradually induced in response to cold stress in BS366 line anthers .
However , the cytoskeleton - associated genes that play key roles in the dynamic organization of the cytoskeleton were dramatically repressed .
Histological studies revealed that the separation of dyads occurred abnormally during male meiosis I , indicating defective male meiotic cytokinesis .
Fluorescence labelling and subcellular histological observations revealed that the phragmoplast was defectively formed and the cell plate was abnormally assembled during meiosis I under cold stress .
Based on the transcriptomic analysis and observations of characterized histological changes , our results suggest that cold stress repressed transcription of cytoskeleton dynamic factors and subsequently caused the defective cytokinesis during meiosis I .
The results may explain the male sterility caused by low temperature in wheat TGMS lines .
Characterizing the role of RNA silencing components in Cryptococcus:__entity__ neoformans:__entity__ .
The RNA interference ( RNAi ) mediated by homology - dependent degradation of the target mRNA with small RNA molecules plays a key role in controlling transcription and translation processes in a number of eukaryotic organisms .
The RNAi machinery is also evolutionarily conserved in a wide variety of fungal species , including pathogenic fungi .
To elucidate the physiological functions of the RNAi pathway in Cryptococcus:__entity__ neoformans:__entity__ that causes fungal meningitis , here we performed genetic analyses for genes encoding Argonaute ( AGO1 and AGO2 ) , RNA - dependent RNA polymerase ( RDP1 ) , and Dicers ( DCR1 and DCR2 ) in both serotype A and D C:__entity__ .:__entity__ neoformans:__entity__ .
The present study shows that Ago1 , Rdp1 , and Dcr2 are the major components of the RNAi process occurring in C:__entity__ .:__entity__ neoformans:__entity__ .
However , the RNAi machinery is not involved in regulation of production of two virulence factors ( capsule and melanin ) , sexual differentiation , and diverse stress response .
Comparative transcriptome analysis of the serotype A and D RNAi mutants revealed that only modest changes occur in the genome - wide transcriptome profiles when the RNAi process was perturbed .
Notably , the serotype D rdp1Delta mutants showed an increase in transcript abundance of active retrotransposons and transposons , such as T2 and T3 , the latter of which is a novel serotype D - specific transposon of C:__entity__ .:__entity__ neoformans:__entity__ .
In a wild type background both T2 and T3 were found to be weakly active mobile elements , although we found no evidence of Cnl1 retrotransposon mobility .
In contrast , all three transposable elements exhibited enhanced mobility in the rdp1Delta mutant strain .
In conclusion , the RNAi pathway plays an important role in controlling transposon activity and genome integrity of C:__entity__ .:__entity__ neoformans:__entity__ .
Fur negatively regulates hns and is required for the expression of HilA and virulence in Salmonella:__entity__ enterica:__entity__ serovar Typhimurium .
Iron is an essential element for the survival of living cells .
However , excess iron is toxic , and its uptake is exquisitely regulated by the ferric uptake regulator , Fur .
In Salmonella , the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI - 1 ) encodes a type three secretion system , which is required for invasion of host epithelial cells in the small intestine .
A major activator of SPI - 1 is HilA , which is encoded within SPI - 1 .
One known regulator of hilA is Fur .
The mechanism of hilA regulation by Fur is unknown .
We report here that Fur is required for virulence in Salmonella:__entity__ enterica:__entity__ serovar Typhimurium and that Fur is required for the activation of hilA , as well as of other HilA - dependent genes , invF and sipC .
The Fur - dependent regulation of hilA was independent of PhoP , a known repressor of hilA .
Instead , the expression of the gene coding for the histone - like protein , hns , was significantly derepressed in the fur mutant .
Indeed , the activation of hilA by Fur was dependent on 28 nucleotides located upstream of hns .
Moreover , we used chromatin immunoprecipitation to show that Fur bound , in vivo , to the upstream region of hns in a metal - dependent fashion .
Finally , deletion of fur in an hns mutant resulted in Fur - independent activation of hilA .
In conclusion , Fur activates hilA by repressing the expression of hns .
MexT regulates the type III secretion system through MexS and PtrC in Pseudomonas aeruginosa .
The type III secretion system ( T3SS ) is the most important virulence factor in Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and its expression level varies in different isolates .
We studied the molecular basis for such differences in two laboratory strains , PAK and PAO1 .
A chromosomal clone library from the high - T3SS - producer strain PAK was introduced into the low - producer strain PAO1 , and we found that a mexS gene from PAK confers high T3SS expression in the PAO1 background .
Further tests demonstrated that both mexS and its neighboring mexT gene are required for the repression of the T3SS in PAO1 , while the PAK genome encodes a defective MexS , accounting for the derepression of the T3SS in PAK and the dominant negative effect when it is introduced into PAO1 .
MexS is a probable oxidoreductase whose expression is dependent on MexT , a LysR - type transcriptional regulator .
Various genetic data support the idea that MexS modulates the transcriptional regulator function of MexT .
In searching for the MexT - dependent repressor of the T3SS , a small gene product of PA2486 ( ptrC ) was found effective in suppressing the T3SS upon overexpression .
However , deletion of ptrC in the PAO1 background did not result in derepression of the T3SS , indicating the presence of another repressor for the T3SS .
Interestingly , overexpression of functional mexS alone was sufficient to repress T3SS even in the absence of MexT , suggesting that MexS is another mediator of MexT - dependent T3SS repression .
Overexpression of mexS alone had no effect on the well - known MexT - dependent genes , including those encoding MexEF efflux pump , elastase , and pyocyanin , indicating alternative regulatory mechanisms .
A model has been proposed for the MexS / MexT - mediated regulation of the T3SS , the MexEF efflux pump , and the production of elastase and pyocyanin .
Complete genome sequence of the haloaromatic acid - degrading bacterium Achromobacter:__entity__ xylosoxidans:__entity__ A8:__entity__ .
Achromobacter:__entity__ xylosoxidans:__entity__ strain:__entity__ A8:__entity__ was isolated from soil contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls .
It can use 2 - chlorobenzoate and 2 , 5 - dichlorobenzoate as sole sources of carbon and energy .
This property makes it a good starting microorganism for further development toward a bioremediation tool .
The genome of A:__entity__ .:__entity__ xylosoxidans:__entity__ consists of a 7 - Mb chromosome and two large plasmids ( 98 kb and 248 kb ) .
Besides genes for the utilization of xenobiotic organic substrates , it contains genes associated with pathogenesis , toxin production , and resistance .
Here , we report the complete genome sequence .
Complete genome sequences of three Erwinia:__entity__ amylovora:__entity__ phages isolated in north america and a bacteriophage induced from an Erwinia:__entity__ tasmaniensis:__entity__ strain .
Fire blight , a plant disease of economic importance caused by Erwinia:__entity__ amylovora:__entity__ , may be controlled by the application of bacteriophages .
Here , we provide the complete genome sequences and the annotation of three E:__entity__ .:__entity__ amylovora:__entity__ - specific phages isolated in North America and genomic information about a bacteriophage induced by mitomycin C treatment of an Erwinia:__entity__ tasmaniensis:__entity__ strain that is antagonistic for E:__entity__ .:__entity__ amylovora:__entity__ .
The American phages resemble two already - described viral genomes , whereas the E:__entity__ .:__entity__ tasmaniensis:__entity__ phage displays a singular genomic sequence in BLAST searches .
Promoter discrimination at class I MarA regulon promoters mediated by glutamic acid 89 of the MarA transcriptional activator of Escherichia:__entity__ coli:__entity__ .
Three paralogous transcriptional activators MarA , SoxS , and Rob , activate > 40 Escherichia:__entity__ coli:__entity__ promoters .
To understand why MarA does not activate certain promoters as strongly as SoxS , we compared MarA , MarA mutants , and SoxS for their abilities to activate 16 promoters and to bind their cognate marbox binding sites .
Replacement of the MarA glutamic acid residue 89 with alanine greatly increased the marbox binding and activation of many class I promoters .
Like cells constitutive for SoxS , cells expressing the MarA with the E89A mutation were more resistant to superoxides than those harboring WT MarA .
The activities of several other E89 substitutions ranked as follows : E89A > E89G > E89V > WT > E89D .
Increased binding and activation occurred only at class I promoters when the 12th base of the promoter ' s marbox ( a position at which there is no known interaction between the marbox and MarA ) was not a T residue .
Furthermore , WT MarA binding to a synthetic marbox in vitro was enhanced when the phosphate group between positions 12 and 13 was eliminated on one strand .
The results demonstrate that relatively minor changes in a single amino acid side chain ( e . g . , alanine to valine or glutamic acid to aspartic acid ) can strongly influence activity despite any evidence that the side chain is involved in positive interactions with either DNA or RNA polymerase .
We present a model which attributes the differences in binding and activation to the interference between the Beta - and gamma - carbons of the amino acid at position 89 and the phosphate group between positions 12 and 13 .
A model - driven approach to quantify migration patterns : individual , regional and yearly differences .
1 .
Animal migration has long intrigued scientists and wildlife managers alike , yet migratory species face increasing challenges because of habitat fragmentation , climate change and over - exploitation .
Central to the understanding migratory species is the objective discrimination between migratory and nonmigratory individuals in a given population , quantifying the timing , duration and distance of migration and the ability to predict migratory movements .
2 .
Here , we propose a uniform statistical framework to ( i ) separate migration from other movement behaviours , ( ii ) quantify migration parameters without the need for arbitrary cut - off criteria and ( iii ) test predictability across individuals , time and space .
3 .
We first validated our novel approach by simulating data based on established theoretical movement patterns .
We then formulated the expected shapes of squared displacement patterns as nonlinear models for a suite of movement behaviours to test the ability of our method to distinguish between migratory movement and other movement types .
4 .
We then tested our approached empirically using 108 wild Global Positioning System ( GPS ) - collared moose:__entity__ Alces:__entity__ alces:__entity__ in Scandinavia as a study system because they exhibit a wide range of movement behaviours , including resident , migrating and dispersing individuals , within the same population .
Applying our approach showed that 87 % and 67 % of our Swedish and Norwegian subpopulations , respectively , can be classified as migratory .
5 .
Using nonlinear mixed effects models for all migratory individuals we showed that the distance , timing and duration of migration differed between the sexes and between years , with additional individual differences accounting for a large part of the variation in the distance of migration but not in the timing or duration .
Overall , the model explained most of the variation ( 92 % ) and also had high predictive power for the same individuals over time ( 69 % ) as well as between study populations ( 74 % ) .
6 .
The high predictive ability of the approach suggests that it can help increase our understanding of the drivers of migration and could provide key quantitative information for understanding and managing a broad range of migratory species .
Citrate uptake in exchange with intermediates in the citrate metabolic pathway in Lactococcus:__entity__ lactis:__entity__ IL1403 .
Carbohydrate / citrate cometabolism in Lactococcus:__entity__ lactis:__entity__ results in the formation of the flavor compound acetoin .
Resting cells of strain IL1403:__entity__ ( pFL3 ) rapidly consumed citrate while producing acetoin when substoichiometric concentrations of glucose or l - lactate were present .
A proton motive force was generated by electrogenic exchange of citrate and lactate catalyzed by the citrate transporter CitP and proton consumption in decarboxylation reactions in the pathway .
In the absence of glucose or l - lactate , citrate consumption was biphasic .
During the first phase , hardly any citrate was consumed .
In the second phase , citrate was converted rapidly , but without the formation of acetoin .
Instead , significant amounts of the intermediates pyruvate and alpha - acetolactate , and the end product acetate , were excreted from the cells .
It is shown that the intermediates and acetate are excreted in exchange with the uptake of citrate catalyzed by CitP .
The availability of exchangeable substrates in the cytoplasm determines both the rate of citrate consumption and the end product profile .
It follows that citrate metabolism in L:__entity__ .:__entity__ lactis:__entity__ IL1403 ( pFL3 ) splits up in two routes after the formation of pyruvate , one the well - characterized route yielding acetoin and the other a new route yielding acetate .
The flux distribution between the two branches changes from 85 : 15 in the presence of l - lactate to 30 : 70 in the presence of pyruvate .
The proton motive force generated was greatest in the presence of l - lactate and zero in the presence of pyruvate , suggesting that the pathway to acetate does not generate proton motive force .
Interbacterial macromolecular transfer by the Campylobacter:__entity__ fetus:__entity__ subsp:__entity__ .:__entity__ venerealis:__entity__ type IV secretion system .
We report here the first demonstration of intra - and interspecies conjugative plasmid DNA transfer for Campylobacter:__entity__ fetus:__entity__ .
Gene regions carried by a Campylobacter:__entity__ coli:__entity__ plasmid were identified that are sufficient for conjugative mobilization to Escherichia:__entity__ coli:__entity__ and C:__entity__ .:__entity__ fetus:__entity__ recipients .
A broader functional range is predicted .
Efficient DNA transfer involves the virB9 and virD4 genes of the type IV bacterial secretion system encoded by a pathogenicity island of C:__entity__ .:__entity__ fetus:__entity__ subsp:__entity__ .:__entity__ venerealis:__entity__ .
Complementation of these phenotypes from expression constructions based on the promoter of the C:__entity__ .:__entity__ fetus:__entity__ surface antigen protein ( sap ) locus was temperature dependent , and a temperature regulation of the sap promoter was subsequently confirmed under laboratory conditions .
Gene transfer was sensitive to surface or entry exclusion functions in potential recipient cells carrying IncPalpha plasmid RP4 implying functional relatedness to C:__entity__ .:__entity__ fetus:__entity__ proteins .
The virB / virD4 locus is also known to be involved in bacterial invasion and killing of cultured human:__entity__ cells in vitro .
Whether specifically secreted effector proteins contribute to host colonization and infection activities is currently unknown .
Two putative effector proteins carrying an FIC domain conserved in a few bacterial type III and type IV secreted proteins of pathogens were analyzed for secretion by the C:__entity__ .:__entity__ fetus:__entity__ or heterologous conjugative systems .
No evidence for interbacterial translocation of the Fic proteins was found .
Canopy connectivity and the availability of diverse nesting resources affect species coexistence in arboreal ants .
1 .
Arboreal ants are both diverse and ecologically dominant in the tropics .
Such ecologically important groups are likely to be particularly useful in ongoing empirical efforts to understand the processes that regulate species diversity and coexistence .
2 .
Our study addresses how access to tree - based resources and the diversity of pre - existing nesting cavities affect species diversity and coexistence in tropical arboreal ant assemblages .
We focus on assemblage - level responses to these variables at local scales .
We first surveyed arboreal ant diversity across three naturally occurring levels of canopy connectivity and a gradient of tree size .
We then conducted whole - tree experimental manipulations of canopy connectivity and the diversity of cavity entrance sizes .
All work was conducted in the Brazilian savanna or ' cerrado ' .
3 .
Our survey suggested that species richness was equivalent among levels of connectivity .
However , there was a consistent trend of lower species density with low canopy connectivity .
This was confirmed at the scale of individual trees , with low - connectivity trees having significantly fewer species across all tree sizes .
Our experiment demonstrated directly that low canopy connectivity results in significantly fewer species coexisting per tree .
4 .
A diverse array of cavity entrance sizes did not significantly increase overall species per tree .
Nevertheless , cavity diversity did significantly increase the species using new cavities on each tree , the species per tree unique to new cavities , total species using new cavities , and total cavity use .
The populations of occupied cavities were consistent with newly founded colonies and new nests of established colonies from other trees .
Cavity diversity thus appears to greatly affect new colony founding and colony growth .
5 .
These results contribute strong evidence that greater resource access and greater cavity diversity have positive effects on species coexistence in local arboreal ant assemblages .
More generally , these positive effects are broadly consistent with niche differentiation promoting local species coexistence in diverse arboreal ant assemblages .
The contributions of this study to the understanding of the processes of species coexistence are discussed , along with the potential of the focal system for future work on this issue .
Ontogeny and leaf gas exchange mediate the carbon isotopic signature of herbaceous plants .
Values ( Delta ( i ) ) predicted by a simplified photosynthetic discrimination model , based only on diffusion through air followed by carboxylation , are often used to infer ecological conditions from the ^ 1 ^ 3C signature of plant organs ( delta ^ 1 ^ 3C ( p ) ) .
Recent studies showed that additional isotope discrimination ( d that includes mesophyll conductance , photorespiration and day respiration , and post - carboxylation discrimination ) can strongly affect delta ^ 1 ^ 3C ( p ) ; however , little is known about its variability during plant ontogeny for different species .
Effect of ontogeny on leaf gas exchange rates , Delta ( i ) , observed discrimination ( Delta ( p ) ) and d in leaf , phloem and root of seven herbaceous species at three ontogenetic stages were investigated under controlled conditions .
Functional group identity and ontogeny significantly affected Delta ( i ) and Delta ( p ) .
However , predicted Delta ( i ) did not match Delta ( p ) .
d , strongly affected by functional group identity and ontogeny , varied by up to 14 % .
d scaled tightly with stomatal conductance , suggesting complex controls including changes in mesophyll conductance .
The magnitude of the changes in delta ^ 1 ^ 3C ( p ) due to ontogeny was similar to that due to environmental factors reported in other studies .
d and ontogeny should , therefore , be considered in ecosystem studies , integrated in ecosystem models using delta ^ 1 ^ 3C ( p ) and limit the applicability of delta ^ 1 ^ 3C ( leaf ) as a proxy for water - use efficiency in herbaceous plants .
The pH regulatory factor Pac1 regulates Tri gene expression and trichothecene production in Fusarium:__entity__ graminearum:__entity__ .
Fungi manage the adaptation to extra - cellular pH through the PacC transcription factor , a key component of the pH regulatory system .
PacC regulates the production of various secondary metabolites in filamentous fungi .
In the important cereal pathogen Fusarium:__entity__ graminearum:__entity__ , the production of trichothecene is induced only under acidic pH conditions .
Here , we examined the role of the PacC homologue from F:__entity__ .:__entity__ graminearum:__entity__ , FgPac1 , on the regulation of trichothecene production .
An FgDeltaPac1 deletion mutant was constructed in F:__entity__ .:__entity__ graminearum:__entity__ which showed a reduced development under neutral and alkaline pH , increased sensitivity to H ( 2 ) O ( 2 ) and an earlier Tri gene induction and toxin accumulation at acidic pH .
A strain expressing the FgPac1 ( c ) constitutively active form of Pac1 exhibited a strongly repressed Tri gene expression and reduced toxin accumulation at acidic pH .
These results demonstrate that Pac1 negatively regulates Tri gene expression and toxin production in F:__entity__ .:__entity__ graminearum:__entity__ .
Tracking a century of global expansion and evolution of HIV:__entity__ to drive understanding and to combat disease .
Since the isolation of HIV:__entity__ , multiple transmissions are thought to have occurred between man and other old - world primates .
Assessment of samples from apes and human:__entity__ beings with African equatorial forest ancestry has traced the origin of HIV:__entity__ -:__entity__ 1:__entity__ to chimpanzees:__entity__ , and dated its most recent common ancestor to 1908 .
The evolution of HIV:__entity__ -:__entity__ 1:__entity__ has been rapid , which has resulted in a complex classification , worldwide spread , and intermixing of strains ; at least 48 circulating recombinant forms are currently identified .
In addition to posing a nearly insurmountable challenge for diagnosis , treatment , vaccine development , and prevention , this extreme and divergent evolution has led to differences in virulence between HIV:__entity__ -:__entity__ 1:__entity__ groups , subtypes , or both .
Coincidental changes in human:__entity__ migration in the Congo river basin also affected spread of disease .
Research over the past 25 years and advances in genomic sequencing methods , such as deep DNA sequencing , have greatly improved understanding and analysis of the thousands to millions of full infectious HIV:__entity__ -:__entity__ 1:__entity__ genomes .
A caffeyl - coenzyme A synthetase initiates caffeate activation prior to caffeate reduction in the acetogenic bacterium Acetobacterium:__entity__ woodii:__entity__ .
The anaerobic acetogenic bacterium Acetobacterium:__entity__ woodii:__entity__ couples the reduction of caffeate with electrons derived from hydrogen to the synthesis of ATP by a chemiosmotic mechanism using sodium ions as coupling ions , but the enzymes involved remain to be established .
Previously , the electron transfer flavoproteins EtfA and EtfB were found to be involved in caffeate respiration .
By inverse PCR , we identified three genes upstream of etfA and etfB : carA , carB , and carC .
carA encodes a potential coenzyme A ( CoA ) transferase , carB an acyl - CoA synthetase , and carC an acyl - CoA dehydrogenase .
carA , - B , and - C are located together with etfA / carE and etfB / carD on one polycistronic message , indicating that CarA , CarB , and CarC are also part of the caffeate respiration pathway .
The genetic data suggest an initial ATP - dependent activation of caffeate by CarB .
To prove the proposed function of CarB , the protein was overproduced in Escherichia:__entity__ coli:__entity__ , and the recombinant protein was purified .
Purified CarB activates caffeate to caffeyl - CoA in an ATP - and CoA - dependent reaction .
The enzyme has broad pH and temperature optima and requires K ( + ) for activity .
In addition to caffeate , it can use p - coumarate , ferulate , and cinnamate as substrates , with 50 , 15 , and 9 % , respectively , of the activity obtained with caffeate .
Expression of the car operon is induced not only by caffeate , p - coumarate , ferulate , and cinnamate but also by sinapate .
There is no induction by p - hydroxybenzoate or syringate .
Complete genome sequence of Burkholderia:__entity__ rhizoxinica:__entity__ , an Endosymbiont of Rhizopus:__entity__ microsporus:__entity__ .
Burkholderia:__entity__ rhizoxinica:__entity__ is an intracellular symbiont of the phytopathogenic fungus Rhizopus:__entity__ microsporus:__entity__ .
The vertically transmitted endosymbiont not only delivers the antimitotic macrolide rhizoxin to its host but is also essential for vegetative spore formation of the fungus .
To shed light on the genetic equipment of this model organism , we sequenced the whole genome of B:__entity__ .:__entity__ rhizoxinica:__entity__ HKI:__entity__ 0454:__entity__ , thus providing the first genomic insight into an intracellular mutualist of a fungal species .
The 3 . 75 - Mb genome consists of a chromosome and two strain - specific plasmids .
The primary metabolism appears to be specialized for the uptake of fungal metabolites .
Besides the rhizoxin biosynthesis gene cluster , there are 14 loci coding for nonribosomal peptide synthetase ( NRPS ) assembly lines , which represent novel targets for genomic mining of cryptic natural products .
Furthermore , the endosymbionts are equipped with a repertoire of virulence - related factors , which can now be studied to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying bacterial - fungal interaction .
Network topology : patterns and mechanisms in plant - herbivore and host - parasitoid food webs .
1 .
Biological communities are organized in complex interaction networks such as food webs , which topology appears to be non - random .
Gradients , compartments , nested subsets and even combinations of these structures have been shown in bipartite networks .
However , in most studies only one pattern is tested against randomness and mechanistic hypotheses are generally lacking .
2 .
Here we examined the topology of regional , coexisting plant - herbivore and host - parasitoid food webs to discriminate between the mentioned network patterns .
We also evaluated the role of species body size , local abundance , regional frequency and phylogeny as determinants of network topology .
3 .
We found both food webs to be compartmented , with interaction range boundaries imposed by host phylogeny .
Species degree within compartments was mostly related to their regional frequency and local abundance .
Only one compartment showed an internal nested structure in the distribution of interactions between species , but species position within this compartment was unrelated to species size or abundance .
4 .
These results suggest that compartmentalization may be more common than previously considered , and that network structure is a result of multiple , hierarchical , non - exclusive processes .
Gel - based mass spectrometric and computational approaches to the mitochondrial proteome of Neurospora .
We have used gel electrophoretic techniques including isoelectric focusing , blue native , acid - urea , 16 - benzyldimethyl - n - hexadecylammonium chloride or SDS first dimensions and SDS Laemmli or tricine second dimensions to separate the proteins from highly - purified Neurospora mitochondria and sub - mitochondrial fractions ( membrane , soluble , protein complexes and ribonucleoproteins ) .
The products of 260 genes , many of them in multiple processed or modified forms , were identified by MALDI - TOF mass spectrometry .
This work confirms the existence , expression , and mitochondrial localization of the products of 55 Neurospora genes previously annotated only as predicted or hypothetical , and of 101 genes not identified in previous mass spectrometry studies .
Combined with previous mass spectrometry studies , and re - evaluation of genome annotations , we have compiled a curated list of 358 proteins identified in proteomic studies that are likely to be bona fide mitochondrial proteins plus 80 other identified proteins that may be mitochondrial .
Literature data mining and computational predictions suggest that Neurospora mitochondria also contain another 299 proteins not yet identified in proteomics projects .
Taken together , these data suggest that the products of at least 738 genes comprise the Neurospora mitochondrial proteome .
Sequenced dermatophyte strains : growth rate , conidiation , drug susceptibilities , and virulence in an invertebrate model .
Although dermatophytes are the most common cause of fungal infections in the world , their basic biology is not well understood .
The recent sequencing and annotation of the genomes of five representative dermatophyte species allows for the creation of hypotheses as to how they cause disease and have adapted to their distinct environments .
An understanding of the microbiology of these strains will be essential for testing these hypotheses .
This study is the first to generally characterize these five sequenced strains of dermatophytes for their microbiological aspects .
We measured the growth rate on solid medium and found differences between species , with Microsporum:__entity__ gypseum:__entity__ CBS118893 having the fastest growth and Trichophyton:__entity__ rubrum:__entity__ CBS118892 the slowest .
We also compared different media for conidia production and found that the highest numbers of conidia were produced when dermatophytes were grown on MAT agar .
We determined the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration ( MIC ) of nine antifungal agents and confirmed susceptibility to antifungals commonly used as selectable markers .
Finally , we tested virulence in the Galleria:__entity__ mellonella:__entity__ ( wax:__entity__ moth:__entity__ ) larvae model but found the results variable .
These results increase our understanding of the microbiology and molecular biology of these dermatophyte strains and will be of use in advancing hypothesis - driven research about dermatophytes .
Relating the physical properties of Pseudomonas:__entity__ aeruginosa:__entity__ lipopolysaccharides to virulence by atomic force microscopy .
Lipopolysaccharides ( LPS ) are an important class of macromolecules that are components of the outer membrane of Gram - negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas:__entity__ aeruginosa:__entity__ .
P:__entity__ .:__entity__ aeruginosa:__entity__ contains two different sugar chains , the homopolymer common antigen ( A band ) and the heteropolymer O antigen ( B band ) , which impart serospecificity .
The characteristics of LPS are generally assessed after isolation rather than in the context of whole bacteria .
Here we used atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) to probe the physical properties of the LPS of P:__entity__ .:__entity__ aeruginosa:__entity__ strain:__entity__ PA103:__entity__ ( serogroup O11 ) in situ .
This strain contains a mixture of long and very long polymers of O antigen , regulated by two different genes .
For this analysis , we studied the wild - type strain and four mutants , DeltaWzz1 ( producing only very long LPS ) , DeltaWzz2 ( producing only long LPS ) , DDeltaM ( with both the wzz1 and wzz2 genes deleted ) , and Wzy : : GM ( producing an LPS core oligosaccharide plus one unit of O antigen ) .
Forces of adhesion between the LPS on these strains and the silicon nitride AFM tip were measured , and the Alexander and de Gennes model of steric repulsion between a flat surface and a polymer brush was used to calculate the LPS layer thickness ( which we refer to as length ) , compressibility , and spacing between the individual molecules .
LPS chains were longest for the wild - type strain and DeltaWzz1 , at 170 . 6 and 212 . 4 nm , respectively , and these values were not statistically significantly different from one another .
Wzy : : GM and DDeltaM have reduced LPS lengths , at 34 . 6 and 37 . 7 nm , respectively .
Adhesion forces were not correlated with LPS length , but a relationship between adhesion force and bacterial pathogenicity was found in a mouse:__entity__ acute pneumonia model of infection .
The adhesion forces with the AFM probe were lower for strains with LPS mutations , suggesting that the wild - type strain is optimized for maximal adhesion .
Our research contributes to further understanding of the role of LPS in the adhesion and virulence of P:__entity__ .:__entity__ aeruginosa:__entity__ .
The minor pilin subunit Sgp2 is necessary for assembly of the pilus encoded by the srtG cluster of Streptococcus:__entity__ suis:__entity__ .
Gram - positive pili are composed of covalently bound pilin subunits whose assembly is mediated via a pilus - specific sortase ( s ) .
Major subunits constitute the pilus backbone and are therefore essential for pilus formation .
Minor subunits are also incorporated into the pilus , but they are considered to be dispensable for backbone formation .
The srtG cluster is one of the putative pilus gene clusters identified in the major swine:__entity__ pathogen Streptococcus:__entity__ suis:__entity__ .
It consists of one sortase gene ( srtG ) and two putative pilin subunit genes ( sgp1 and sgp2 ) .
In this study , by constructing mutants for each of the genes in the cluster and by both immunoblotting and immunogold electron microscopic analysis with antibodies against Sgp1 and Sgp2 , we found that the srtG cluster mediates the expression of pilus - like structures in S:__entity__ .:__entity__ suis:__entity__ strain:__entity__ 89:__entity__ /:__entity__ 1591:__entity__ .
In this pilus , Sgp1 forms the backbone , whereas Sgp2 is incorporated as the minor subunit .
In accordance with the current model of pilus assembly by Gram - positive organisms , the major subunit Sgp1 was indispensable for backbone formation and the cognate sortase SrtG mediated the polymerization of both subunits .
However , unlike other well - characterized Gram - positive bacterial pili , the minor subunit Sgp2 was required for polymerization of the major subunit Sgp1 .
Because Sgp2 homologues are encoded in several other Gram - positive bacterial pilus gene clusters , in some types of pili , minor pilin subunits may contribute to backbone formation by a novel mechanism .
Growth and reproductive costs of larval defence in the aposematic lepidopteran Pieris:__entity__ brassicae:__entity__ .
1 .
Utilization of plant secondary compounds for antipredator defence is common in immature herbivorous insects .
Such defences may incur a cost to the animal , either in terms of survival , growth rate or in the reproductive success .
2 .
A common defence in lepidopterans is the regurgitation of semi - digested material containing the defensive compounds of the food plant , a defence which has led to gut specialization in this order .
Regurgitation is often swift in response to cuticular stimulation and deters predators from consuming or parasitizing the larva .
The loss of food and other gut material seems likely to impact on fitness , but evidence is lacking .
3 .
Here , we raised larvae of the common crop pest Pieris:__entity__ brassicae:__entity__ on commercial cabbage:__entity__ leaves , simulated predator attacks throughout the larval period , and measured life - history responses .
4 .
We found that the probability of survival to pupation decreased with increasing frequency of attacks , but this was because of regurgitation rather than the stimulation itself .
There was a growth cost to the defence such that the more regurgitant that individuals produced over the growth period , the smaller they were at pupation .
5 .
The number of mature eggs in adult females was positively related to pupal mass , but this relationship was only found when individuals were not subjected to a high frequency of predator simulation .
This suggests that there might be cryptic fitness costs to common defensive responses that are paid despite apparent growth rate being maintained .
6 .
Our results demonstrate a clear life - history cost of an antipredator defence in a model pest species and show that under certain conditions , such as high predation threat , the expected relationship between female body size and potential fecundity can be disrupted .
Huntington ' s disease : from molecular pathogenesis to clinical treatment .
Huntington ' s disease is a progressive , fatal , neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the huntingtin gene , which encodes an abnormally long polyglutamine repeat in the huntingtin protein .
Huntington ' s disease has served as a model for the study of other more common neurodegenerative disorders , such as Alzheimer ' s disease and Parkinson ' s disease .
These disorders all share features including : delayed onset ; selective neuronal vulnerability , despite widespread expression of disease - related proteins during the whole lifetime ; abnormal protein processing and aggregation ; and cellular toxic effects involving both cell autonomous and cell - cell interaction mechanisms .
Pathogenic pathways of Huntington ' s disease are beginning to be unravelled , offering targets for treatments .
Additionally , predictive genetic testing and findings of neuroimaging studies show that , as in some other neurodegenerative disorders , neurodegeneration in affected individuals begins many years before onset of diagnosable signs and symptoms of Huntington ' s disease , and it is accompanied by subtle cognitive , motor , and psychiatric changes ( so - called prodromal disease ) .
Thus , Huntington ' s disease is also emerging as a model for strategies to develop therapeutic interventions , not only to slow progression of manifest disease but also to delay , or ideally prevent , its onset .
Natural history and intragenomic dynamics of the Transib transposon Hztransib in the cotton:__entity__ bollworm:__entity__ Helicoverpa:__entity__ zea:__entity__ .
Hztransib , recently identified from Helicoverpa:__entity__ zea:__entity__ , represents the first intact and transcriptionally active Transib element .
Its open reading frame was detected in Helicoverpa:__entity__ armigera:__entity__ , from which H:__entity__ .:__entity__ zea:__entity__ evolved , and in Helicoverpa:__entity__ assulta:__entity__ , the common ancestor of H:__entity__ .:__entity__ zea:__entity__ and H:__entity__ .:__entity__ armigera:__entity__ , but its remaining parts were found only in H:__entity__ .:__entity__ armigera:__entity__ .
Thirty - nine Hztransib insertion sites , all of which are polymorphic , were detected from eight populations of H:__entity__ .:__entity__ zea:__entity__ .
Out of the 39 insertion sites , 35 were not frequently occupied , with 1 - 33 occurrences in a total of 128 individuals from the eight populations ( 16 larvae per population ) .
Its copy number ranged from 5 . 8 to 14 . 2 per individual , with putative intact copies always more abundant than internally deleted ones .
Taking this evidence together , Hztransib probably transferred to H:__entity__ .:__entity__ zea:__entity__ from H:__entity__ .:__entity__ armigera:__entity__ and most likely still retains its capacity to maintain structural integrity , increase copy number and remobilize in H:__entity__ .:__entity__ zea:__entity__ .
Identification of an extracellular polysaccharide network essential for cytochrome anchoring and biofilm formation in Geobacter:__entity__ sulfurreducens:__entity__ .
Transposon insertions in Geobacter:__entity__ sulfurreducens:__entity__ GSU1501 , part of an ATP - dependent exporter within an operon of polysaccharide biosynthesis genes , were previously shown to eliminate insoluble Fe ( III ) reduction and use of an electrode as an electron acceptor .
Replacement of GSU1501 with a kanamycin resistance cassette produced a similarly defective mutant , which could be partially complemented by expression of GSU1500 to GSU1505 in trans .
The Delta1501 mutant demonstrated limited cell - cell agglutination , enhanced attachment to negatively charged surfaces , and poor attachment to positively charged poly - d - lysine - or Fe ( III ) - coated surfaces .
Wild - type and mutant cells attached to graphite electrodes , but when electrodes were poised at an oxidizing potential inducing a positive surface charge ( + 0 . 24 V versus the standard hydrogen electrode [ SHE ] ) , Delta1501 mutant cells detached .
Scanning electron microscopy revealed fibrils surrounding wild - type G:__entity__ .:__entity__ sulfurreducens:__entity__ which were absent from the Delta1501 mutant .
Similar amounts of type IV pili and pilus - associated cytochromes were detected on both cell types , but shearing released a stable matrix of c - type cytochromes and other proteins bound to polysaccharides .
The matrix from the mutant contained 60 % less sugar and was nearly devoid of c - type cytochromes such as OmcZ .
The addition of wild - type extracellular matrix to Delta1501 cultures restored agglutination and Fe ( III ) reduction .
The polysaccharide binding dye Congo red preferentially bound wild - type cells and extracellular matrix material over mutant cells , and Congo red inhibited agglutination and Fe ( III ) reduction by wild - type cells .
These results demonstrate a crucial role for the xap ( extracellular anchoring polysaccharide ) locus in metal oxide attachment , cell - cell agglutination , and localization of essential cytochromes beyond the Geobacter outer membrane .
Hyphal and cytoskeleton polarization in Tuber:__entity__ melanosporum:__entity__ : a genomic and cellular analysis .
Filamentous polarized growth involves a series of events including polarization of the cytoskeleton to selected growth sites , and the transport of secretory vesicles containing the components required for growth .
The availability of fungal genome sequences has recently led to the identification of a large number of proteins involved in these processes .
We have explored the Tuber:__entity__ melanosporum:__entity__ genome sequence by searching for homologs of genes known to play crucial roles in the morphogenesis and cell polarity of yeasts:__entity__ and filamentous fungi .
One hundred and forty - nine genes have been identified and functionally grouped according to the deduced amino acid sequences ( 44 genes involved in cell polarity / morphogenesis , 39 belonging to the actin cytoskeleton and 66 involved in membrane dynamics , septation and exocytosis ) .
A detailed gene annotation has shown that most components of the cell polarity machinery , morphogenesis and cytoskeleton found in yeasts:__entity__ and filamentous fungi are conserved , although the degree of similarity varies from strong to weak .
Microscopic analysis of quick - frozen truffle hyphae detected the characteristic subcellular components of the hyphal tip in septate filamentous fungi , while transcript profiles revealed a moderately variable pattern during the biological cycle .
Proteomics of cryoprotective dehydration in Megaphorura:__entity__ arctica:__entity__ Tullberg 1876 ( Onychiuridae : Collembola ) .
The Arctic:__entity__ springtail:__entity__ , Megaphorura:__entity__ arctica:__entity__ Tullberg 1876 ( Onychiuridae : Collembola ) , is one of the few organisms known to survive the extreme stresses of its environment by using cryoprotective dehydration .
We have undertaken a proteomics study comparing M:__entity__ .:__entity__ arctica:__entity__ , acclimated at - 2 ^ 0C , the temperature known to induce the production of the anhydroprotectant trehalose in this species , and - 6 ^ 0C , the temperature at which trehalose expression plateaus , against control animals acclimated at + 5 ^ 0C .
Using difference gel electrophoresis , and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry , we identified three categories of differentially expressed proteins with specific functions , up - regulated in both the - 2 ^ 0C and - 6 ^ 0C animals , that were involved in metabolism , membrane transport and protein folding .
Proteins involved in cytoskeleton organisation were only up - regulated in the - 6 ^ 0C animals .
The pyrokinin / pheromone biosynthesis - activating neuropeptide ( PBAN ) family of peptides and their receptors in Insecta : evolutionary trace indicates potential receptor ligand - binding domains .
The pyrokinin / pheromone biosynthesis - activating neuropeptide ( PBAN ) family of G - protein - coupled receptors and their ligands have been identified in various insects .
Physiological functions of pyrokinin peptides include muscle contraction , whereas PBAN regulates , among other functions , pheromone production in moths which indicates the pleiotropic nature of these peptides .
Based on the alignment of annotated genomic sequences , the pyrokinin / PBAN family of receptors have similarity with the corresponding structures of the capa or periviscerokinin receptors of insects and the neuromedin U receptors of vertebrates .
In our study , evolutionary trace ( ET ) analysis on the insect receptor sequences was conducted to predict the putative ligand recognition and binding sites .
The ET analysis of four class - specific receptors indicated several amino acid residues that are conserved in the transmembrane domains .
The receptor extracellular domains exhibit several class - specific amino acid residues , which could indicate putative domains for activation of these receptors by ligand recognition and binding .
acon - 3 , the Neurospora:__entity__ crassa:__entity__ ortholog of the developmental modifier , medA , complements the conidiation defect of the Aspergillus:__entity__ nidulans:__entity__ mutant .
Aspergillus:__entity__ nidulans:__entity__ and Neurospora:__entity__ crassa:__entity__ are ascomycetes that produce asexual spores through morphologically distinct processes .
MedA , a protein with unknown function , is required for normal asexual and sexual development in A:__entity__ .:__entity__ nidulans:__entity__ .
We determined that the N:__entity__ .:__entity__ crassa:__entity__ ortholog of medA is acon - 3 , a gene required for early conidiophore development and female fertility .
To test hypotheses about the evolutionary origins of asexual development in distinct fungal lineages it is important to understand the degree of conservation of developmental regulators .
The amino acid sequences of A:__entity__ .:__entity__ nidulans:__entity__ MedA and N:__entity__ .:__entity__ crassa:__entity__ ACON - 3 shared 37 % identity and 51 % similarity .
acon - 3 is induced at late time points of conidiation .
In contrast , medA is constitutively expressed and MedA protein localizes to nuclei in all tissue types .
Nonetheless , expression of acon - 3 using its native promoter complemented the conidiation defects of the A:__entity__ .:__entity__ nidulans:__entity__ DeltamedA and medA15 mutants .
We conclude that the biochemical activity of the medA orthologs is conserved for conidiation .
Towards achievement of universal health care in India by 2020 : a call to action .
To sustain the positive economic trajectory that India has had during the past decade , and to honour the fundamental right of all citizens to adequate health care , the health of all Indian people has to be given the highest priority in public policy .
We propose the creation of the Integrated National Health System in India through provision of universal health insurance , establishment of autonomous organisations to enable accountable and evidence - based good - quality health - care practices and development of appropriately trained human:__entity__ resources , the restructuring of health governance to make it coordinated and decentralised , and legislation of health entitlement for all Indian people .
The key characteristics of our proposal are to strengthen the public health system as the primary provider of promotive , preventive , and curative health services in India , to improve quality and reduce the out - of - pocket expenditure on health care through a well regulated integration of the private sector within the national health - care system .
Dialogue and consensus building among the stakeholders in the government , civil society , and private sector are the next steps to formalise the actions needed and to monitor their achievement .
In our call to action , we propose that India must achieve health care for all by 2020 .
Financing health care for all : challenges and opportunities .
India ' s health financing system is a cause of and an exacerbating factor in the challenges of health inequity , inadequate availability and reach , unequal access , and poor - quality and costly health - care services .
Low per person spending on health and insufficient public expenditure result in one of the highest proportions of private out - of - pocket expenses in the world .
Citizens receive low value for money in the public and the private sectors .
Financial protection against medical expenditures is far from universal with only 10 % of the population having medical insurance .
The Government of India has made a commitment to increase public spending on health from less than 1 % to 3 % of the gross domestic product during the next few years .
Increased public funding combined with flexibility of financial transfers from centre to state can greatly improve the performance of state - operated public systems .
Enhanced public spending can be used to introduce universal medical insurance that can help to substantially reduce the burden of private out - of - pocket expenditures on health .
Increased public spending can also contribute to quality assurance in the public and private sectors through effective regulation and oversight .
In addition to an increase in public expenditures on health , the Government of India will , however , need to introduce specific methods to contain costs , improve the efficiency of spending , increase accountability , and monitor the effect of expenditures on health .
Continuing challenge of infectious diseases in India .
In India , the range and burden of infectious diseases are enormous .
The administrative responsibilities of the health system are shared between the central ( federal ) and state governments .
Control of diseases and outbreaks is the responsibility of the central Ministry of Health , which lacks a formal public health department for this purpose .
Tuberculosis , malaria , filariasis , visceral leishmaniasis , leprosy , HIV:__entity__ infection , and childhood cluster of vaccine - preventable diseases are given priority for control through centrally managed vertical programmes .
Control of HIV:__entity__ infection and leprosy , but not of tuberculosis , seems to be on track .
Early success of malaria control was not sustained , and visceral leishmaniasis prevalence has increased .
Inadequate containment of the vector has resulted in recurrent outbreaks of dengue fever and re - emergence of Chikungunya:__entity__ virus:__entity__ disease and typhus fever .
Other infectious diseases caused by faecally transmitted pathogens ( enteric fevers , cholera , hepatitis:__entity__ A:__entity__ and E:__entity__ viruses:__entity__ ) and zoonoses ( rabies , leptospirosis , anthrax ) are not in the process of being systematically controlled .
Big gaps in the surveillance and response system for infectious diseases need to be addressed .
Replication of the model of vertical single - disease control for all infectious diseases will not be efficient or viable .
India needs to rethink and revise its health policy to broaden the agenda of disease control .
A comprehensive review and redesign of the health system is needed urgently to ensure equity and quality in health care .
We recommend the creation of a functional public health infrastructure that is shared between central and state governments , with professional leadership and a formally trained public health cadre of personnel who manage an integrated control mechanism of diseases in districts that includes infectious and non - infectious diseases , and injuries .
ATP citrate lyase is required for normal sexual and asexual development in Gibberella:__entity__ zeae:__entity__ .
Adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) citrate lyase ( ACL ) is a key enzyme in the production of cytosolic acetyl - CoA , which is crucial for de novo lipid synthesis and histone acetylation in mammalian cells .
In this study , we characterized the mechanistic roles of ACL in the homothallic ascomycete fungus Gibberella:__entity__ zeae:__entity__ , which causes Fusarium head blight in major cereal crops .
Deletion of ACL in the fungus resulted in a complete loss of self and female fertility as well as a reduction in asexual reproduction , virulence , and trichothecene production .
When the wild - type strain was spermatized with the ACL deletion mutants , they produced viable ascospores , however ascospore delimitation was not properly regulated .
Although lipid synthesis was not affected by ACL deletion , histone acetylation was dramatically reduced in the ACL deletion mutants during sexual development , suggesting that the defects in sexual reproduction were caused by the reduction in histone acetylation .
This study is the first report demonstrating a link between sexual development and ACL - mediated histone acetylation in fungi .
Expression of a Brassica:__entity__ napus:__entity__ heme oxygenase confers plant tolerance to mercury toxicity .
Plant heme oxygenases ( HOs ) regulate biosynthesis of phytochrome which accounts for photo - acceptance and - morphogenesis .
Recent studies have demonstrated that plant HOs also regulate many other physiological processes including response to environmental stimuli .
To elucidate the mechanism by which HOs regulate plant adaptation to heavy metal exposure , three novel HOs genes were isolated from rapeseed:__entity__ ( Brassica:__entity__ napus:__entity__ ) and their expression patterns were analysed .
Alignment of deduced protein sequences revealed that the three BnHOs share high identity with their corresponding orthologos ( AtHO1 - 3 ) from Arabidopsis:__entity__ .
To investigate whether the BnHO regulates plant tolerance to Hg toxicity , we constructed B:__entity__ .:__entity__ napus:__entity__ transgenic plants overexpressing BnHO - 1 .
Under Hg stress , the transgenic plants had 1 . 41 - 1 . 59 folds higher biomass than the untransformants .
However , overexpression of BnHO - 1 resulted in less accumulation of Hg in some lines of transformants than in untransformants .
The transgenic plants show lower abundance of reactive oxygen species and attenuated oxidative injury compared with the untransgenic plants .
We cloned the promoter sequences of BnHO - 1 from B:__entity__ .:__entity__ napus:__entity__ .
Analysis revealed that the 1119 bp fragment contains a conserved Cd responsive element ( CdRE ) and others responding to multiple environmental stimuli .
Transient expression in tobacco:__entity__ leaves showed differential responses to heavy metals ( Zn , Cu , Pb , Hg and Cd ) .
The rate - limiting step for CO ( 2 ) assimilation at different temperatures is influenced by the leaf nitrogen content in several C ( 3 ) crop species .
Effects of nitrogen ( N ) supply on the limiting step of CO ( 2 ) assimilation rate ( A ) at 380 mumol mol ( - 1 ) CO ( 2 ) concentration ( A ( 380 ) ) at several leaf temperatures were studied in several crops , since N nutrition alters N allocation between photosynthetic components .
Contents of leaf N , ribulose 1 * 5 - bisphosphate carboxylase / oxygenase ( Rubisco ) and cytochrome f ( cyt f ) increased with increasing N supply , but the cyt f / Rubisco ratio decreased .
Large leaf N content was linked to a high stomatal ( g ( s ) ) and mesophyll conductance ( g ( m ) ) , but resulted in a lower intercellular ( C ( i ) ) and chloroplast CO ( 2 ) concentration ( C ( c ) ) because the increase in g ( s ) and g ( m ) was insufficient to compensate for change in A ( 380 ) .
The A - C ( c ) response was used to estimate the maximum rate of RuBP carboxylation ( V ( cmax ) ) and chloroplast electron transport ( J ( max ) ) .
The J ( max ) / V ( cmax ) ratio decreased with reductions in leaf N content , which was consistent with the results of the cyt f / Rubisco ratio .
Analysis using the C ( 3 ) photosynthesis model indicated that A ( 380 ) tended to be limited by RuBP carboxylation in plants grown at low N concentration , whereas it was limited by RuBP regeneration in plants grown at high N concentration .
We conclude that the limiting step of A ( 380 ) depends on leaf N content and is mainly determined by N partitioning between Rubisco and electron transport components .
Comparative ionomics and metabolomics in extremophile and glycophytic Lotus species under salt stress challenge the metabolic pre - adaptation hypothesis .
The legume genus Lotus includes glycophytic forage crops and other species adapted to extreme environments , such as saline soils .
Understanding salt tolerance mechanisms will contribute to the discovery of new traits which may enhance the breeding efforts towards improved performance of legumes in marginal agricultural environments .
Here , we used a combination of ionomic and gas chromatography - mass spectrometry ( GC - MS ) - based metabolite profilings of complete shoots ( pooling leaves , petioles and stems ) to compare the extremophile Lotus:__entity__ creticus:__entity__ , adapted to highly saline coastal regions , and two cultivated glycophytic grassland forage species , Lotus:__entity__ corniculatus:__entity__ and Lotus:__entity__ tenuis:__entity__ .
L:__entity__ .:__entity__ creticus:__entity__ exhibited better survival after exposure to long - term lethal salinity and was more efficient at excluding Cl - from the shoots than the glycophytes .
In contrast , Na + levels were higher in the extremophile under both control and salt stress , a trait often observed in halophytes .
Ionomics demonstrated a differential rearrangement of shoot nutrient levels in the extremophile upon salt exposure .
Metabolite profiling showed that responses to NaCl in L:__entity__ .:__entity__ creticus:__entity__ shoots were globally similar to those of the glycophytes , providing little evidence for metabolic pre - adaptation to salinity .
This study is the first comparing salt acclimation responses between extremophile and non - extremophile legumes , and challenges the generalization of the metabolic salt pre - adaptation hypothesis .
The rise of chronic non - communicable diseases in southeast Asia : time for action .
Southeast Asia faces an epidemic of chronic non - communicable diseases , now responsible for 60 % of deaths in the region .
The problem stems from environmental factors that promote tobacco:__entity__ use , unhealthy diet , and inadequate physical activity .
Disadvantaged populations are the hardest hit , with death rates inversely proportional to a country ' s gross national income .
Families shoulder the financial burden , but entire economies suffer as well .
Although attempts to control non - communicable diseases are increasing , more needs to be done .
Health - care systems need to be redesigned to deliver chronic care that is founded on existing primary health - care facilities , but supported by good referral systems .
Surveillance of key modifiable risk factors is needed to monitor the magnitude of the problem and to study the effects of interventions .
All branches of government and all sectors of society have to get involved in establishing environments that are conducive to healthy living .
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations is in a unique position to make a united stand against chronic non - communicable diseases in the region .
Inaction will affect millions of lives - often , the lives of those who have the least .
Aberrant genome size and instability of Phytophthora:__entity__ ramorum:__entity__ oospore progenies .
The functionality of the sexual cycle in the heterothallic pathogen Phytophthora:__entity__ ramorum:__entity__ , causal agent of Sudden Oak Death , has recently been demonstrated .
Sexual reproduction could create genotypic variation and increase the pathogen ' s ability to adapt to other host plants or changing environments .
Genetic characterization using co - dominant microsatellite markers and flow cytometry of single - oospore progeny of crosses between a European A1 isolate and North American or European A2 isolates revealed a considerable number of non - Mendelian inheritance events .
This includes inheritance of more than two alleles at a locus and non - inheritance of alleles from one parent at another locus .
The progenies were mitotically unstable : zoospore and hyphal tip derivatives of the progenies showed genotypic rearrangements and phenotypic variation .
Flow cytometry confirmed variation and instability in DNA content of the single - oospore progenies .
This indicates that single - oospore progenies not only display aberrant genomic and phenotypic variation due to meiotic irregularities , but also extra variation as a result of post - meiotic genomic rearrangements .
Independent duplications of alpha - amylase in different strains of Aspergillus:__entity__ oryzae:__entity__ .
Aspergillus:__entity__ oryzae:__entity__ is a filamentous fungus that has arisen through the ancient domestication of Aspergillus:__entity__ flavus:__entity__ for making traditional oriental foods and beverages .
In the many centuries A:__entity__ .:__entity__ oryzae:__entity__ has been used for fermenting the starch in rice to simple sugars , it has undergone selection for increased secretion of starch - degrading enzymes .
In particular , all A:__entity__ .:__entity__ oryzae:__entity__ strains investigated thus far have two or more copies of a gene encoding alpha - amylase , whereas A:__entity__ .:__entity__ flavus:__entity__ has only one .
Here we investigate the duplications leading to these copies in three A:__entity__ .:__entity__ oryzae:__entity__ strains .
We find evidence of at least three separate duplications of alpha - amylase , an example of parallel evolution in a micro - organism under artificial selection .
At least two of these duplications appear to be associated with activity of transposable elements of the Tc1 / mariner class .
Both involve a 9 . 1 kb element that terminates in inverted repeats , encodes a putative transposase and another putative protein of unknown function , and contains an unusual arrangement of four short internal imperfect repeats .
Although & quot ; unusual Mariners & quot ; of this size have previously been identified in A:__entity__ .:__entity__ oryzae:__entity__ , Aspergillus:__entity__ fumigatus:__entity__ and Aspergillus:__entity__ nidulans:__entity__ , this is the first evidence we know of that at least some of them are active in modern times and that their activity can contribute to beneficial genetic changes .
Response of ecosystems to realistic extinction sequences .
Recent research suggests that effects of species loss on the structure and functioning of ecosystems will critically depend on the order with which species go extinct .
However , there are few studies of the response of natural ecosystems to realistic extinction sequences .
Using an extinction scenario based on the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) Red List , de Visser et al . sequentially deleted species from a topological model of the Serengeti food web .
Under this scenario , large - bodied species like top predators and mega - herbivores go extinct first .
The resulting changes in the trophic structure of the food web might affect the robustness of the ecosystem to future disturbances .
Host characteristics and environmental factors differentially drive the burden and pathogenicity of an ectoparasite : a multilevel causal analysis .
1 .
Understanding the ecological factors driving the burden and pathogenicity of parasites is challenging .
Indeed , the dynamics of host - parasite interactions is driven by factors organized across nested hierarchical levels ( e . g . hosts , localities ) , and indirect effects are expected owing to interactions between levels .
2 .
In this study , we combined Bayesian multilevel models , path analyses and a model selection procedure to account for these complexities and to decipher the relative effects of host - and environment - related factors on the burden and the pathogenicity of an ectoparasite ( Tracheliastes polycolpus ) on its fish host ( Leuciscus:__entity__ leuciscus:__entity__ ) .
We also tested the year - to - year consistency of the relationships linking these factors to the burden and the pathogenic effects of T . polycolpus .
3 .
We found significant relationships between the parasite burden and host - related factors : body length and age were positively related to parasite burden and heterozygous hosts displayed a higher parasite burden .
In contrast , both host - and environment - related factors were linked to pathogenic effects .
Pathogenicity was correlated negatively with host body length and positively with age ; this illustrates that some factors ( e . g . body length ) showed inverse relationships with parasite burden and pathogenicity .
Pathogenic effects were stronger in cooler upstream sites and where host density was lower .
Path analyses revealed that these relationships between environment - related factors and pathogenic effects were direct and were not indirect relationships mediated by the host characteristics .
Finally , we found that the strength and the shape of certain relationships were consistent across years , while they were clearly not for some others .
4 .
Our study illustrates that considering conjointly causal relationships among factors and the hierarchical structure of host - parasite interactions is appropriate for dissecting the complex links between hosts , parasites and their common environment .
Experimental evidence for emergent facilitation : promoting the existence of an invertebrate predator by killing its prey .
1 .
Recent theoretical insights have shown that predator species may help each other to persist by size - selective foraging on a shared prey .
By feeding on a certain prey stage , a predator may induce a compensatory response in another stage of the same prey species , thereby favouring other predators ; a phenomenon referred to as emergent facilitation .
2 .
To test whether emergent facilitation may occur in a natural system , we performed an enclosure experiment where we mimicked fish predation by selectively removing large zooplankton and subsequently following the response of the invertebrate predator Bythotrephes:__entity__ longimanus:__entity__ .
3 .
Positive responses to harvest were observed in the biomass of juvenile individuals of the dominant zooplankton Holopedium:__entity__ gibberum:__entity__ and in Bythotrephes densities .
Hence , by removing large prey , we increased the biomass of small prey , i . e . stage - specific biomass overcompensation was present in the juvenile stage of Holopedium .
This favoured Bythotrephes , which preferentially feed on small Holopedium .
4 .
We argue that the stage - specific overcompensation occurred as a result of increased per capita fecundity of adult Holopedium and as a result of competitive release following harvest .
If shown to be common , emergent facilitation may be a major mechanism behind observed predator extinctions and patterns of predator invasions .
A clone - based transcriptomics approach for the identification of genes relevant for itaconic acid production in Aspergillus .
Several Aspergillus species are well - known for the production of a variety of organic acids .
In this study , a cloned based transcriptomics approach was used to identify genes crucial in the biosynthesis pathway for one of these acids , itaconic acid .
From a number of different Aspergillus:__entity__ terreus:__entity__ controlled batch fermentations , those cultures with the largest difference in itaconic acid titer and productivity were selected for mRNA isolation .
cDNAs derived from these mRNA samples were used for subsequent hybridization of glass slide arrays based on a collection of 5000 cDNA clones .
A selection of 13 cDNA clones resulting in the strongest ( > 10 - fold ) differential hybridization signals were identified and subsequently the inserts of these clones were sequenced .
Sequence analysis revealed the presence of in total five different gene inserts among the sequenced clones .
From one of these sequences , encoding a gene of the MmgE - PrpD family , the full length coding region was shown to encode one of the crucial itaconic acid pathway enzymes cis - aconitate decarboxylase , by heterologous expression in Escherichia coli .
Expression of this gene in Aspergillus:__entity__ niger:__entity__ , which is a natural citric acid producer , resulted in itaconate production .
Genome analysis suggests that in A:__entity__ .:__entity__ terreus:__entity__ the cis - aconitate decarboxylase gene is part of an itaconate acid related gene cluster including genes encoding two pathway specific transporters and a Zinc finger protein .
Interestingly , this cluster is directly linked to the large lovastatin gene cluster .
The outcome of competition between the two chrysomonads Ochromonas sp . and Poterioochromonas:__entity__ malhamensis:__entity__ depends on pH .
We investigated the effect of pH on the competition of two closely related chrysomonad species , Poterioochromonas:__entity__ malhamensis:__entity__ originating from circumneutral Lake Constance , and Ochromonas sp . isolated from a highly acidic mining lake in Austria ( pH - 2 . 6 ) .
We performed pairwise growth experiments between these two species at four different pH ranging from 2 . 5 to 7 . 0 .
Heterotrophic bacteria served as food for both flagellates .
Results were compared to growth rates measured earlier in single species experiments over the same pH range .
We tested the hypothesis that the acidotolerant species benefits from competitive release under conditions of acid stress .
The neutrophilic strain numerically dominated over the acidotolerant strain at pH 7 . 0 , but was the inferior competitor at pH 2 . 5 .
At pH 3 . 5 and 5 . 0 both strains coexisted .
Surprisingly , P:__entity__ .:__entity__ malhamensis:__entity__ prevailed over Ochromonas sp . under moderately acidic conditions , i . e . at the pH where growth rates of the latter peaked when grown alone .
Since bacterial food was not limiting , resource competition is improbable .
It appears more likely that P:__entity__ .:__entity__ malhamensis:__entity__ ingested cells of its slightly smaller competitor .
Adverse effects mediated via allelopathy , either directly on the competing flagellate or indirectly by affecting its bacterial food , might also have affected the outcome of competition .
Differentially expressed genes in silkworm:__entity__ cell cultures in response to infection by Wolbachia and Cardinium endosymbionts .
Wolbachia and Cardinium are bacterial endosymbionts that are widely distributed amongst arthropods .
Both cause reproductive alterations , such as cytoplasmic incompatibility , parthenogenesis and feminization .
Here we studied differentially expressed genes in Wolbachia - and Cardinium - infected Bm - aff3 silkworm:__entity__ cells using a silkworm:__entity__ microarray .
Wolbachia infection did not alter gene expression or induce or suppress immune responses .
In contrast , Cardinium infection induced many immune - related genes , including antimicrobial peptides , pattern recognition receptors and a serine protease .
Host immune responses differed , possibly because of the different cell wall structures of Wolbachia and Cardinium because the former lacks genes encoding lipopolysaccharide components and two racemases for peptidoglycan formation .
A few possibly non - immune - related genes were differentially expressed , but their involvement in host reproductive alteration was unclear .
Neuropeptide Y - like signalling and nutritionally mediated gene expression and behaviour in the honey bee .
Previous research has led to the idea that derived traits can arise through the evolution of novel roles for conserved genes .
We explored whether neuropeptide Y ( NPY ) - like signalling , a conserved pathway that regulates food - related behaviour , is involved in a derived , nutritionally - related trait , the division of labour in worker honey bees .
Transcripts encoding two NPY - like peptides were expressed in separate populations of brain neurosecretory cells , consistent with endocrine functions .
NPY - related genes were upregulated in the brains of older foragers compared with younger bees performing brood care ( ' nurses ' ) .
A subset of these changes can be attributed to nutrition , but neuropeptide F peptide treatments did not influence sugar intake .
These results contrast with recent reports of more robust associations between division of labour and the related insulin - signalling pathway and suggest that some elements of molecular pathways associated with feeding behaviour may be more evolutionarily labile than others .
Apolipoprotein E in Alzheimer ' s disease and other neurological disorders .
Apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) is a 299 - aminoacid protein encoded by the APOE gene .
Three common polymorphisms in the APOE gene , epsilo2 , epsilo3 , and epsilo4 , result in a single aminoacid change in the APOE protein .
APOE epsilo2 , epsilo3 , and epsilo4 alleles strongly alter , in a dose - dependent manner , the likelihood of developing Alzheimer ' s disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy .
In particular , APOE epsilo4 is associated with increased risk for Alzheimer ' s disease whereas APOE epsilo2 is associated with decreased risk .
The effects of APOE genotype on risk of these diseases are likely to be mediated by differential effects of APOE on amyloid - Beta accumulation in the brain and its vasculature .
Response to treatment for Alzheimer ' s disease might differ according to APOE genotype .
Because convincing evidence ties the APOE genotype to risk of Alzheimer ' s disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy , APOE has been studied in other neurological diseases .
APOE epsilo4 is associated with poor outcome after traumatic brain injury and brain haemorrhage , although the mechanisms underlying these associations are unclear .
The possibility that APOE has a role in these and other neurological diseases has been of great interest , but convincing associations have not yet emerged .
Titrating the cost of plant toxins against predators : determining the tipping point for foraging herbivores .
1 .
Foraging herbivores must deal with plant characteristics that inhibit feeding and they must avoid being eaten .
Principally , toxins limit food intake , while predation risk alters how long animals are prepared to harvest resources .
Each of these factors strongly affects how herbivores use food patches , and both constraints can pose immediate proximate costs and long - term consequences to fitness .
2 .
Using a generalist mammalian herbivore , the common:__entity__ brushtail:__entity__ possum:__entity__ ( Trichosurus:__entity__ vulpecula:__entity__ ) , our aim was to quantitatively compare the influence of plant toxin and predation risk on foraging decisions .
3 .
We performed a titration experiment by offering animals a choice between non - toxic food at a risky patch paired with food with one of five toxin concentrations at a safe patch .
This allowed us to identify the tipping point , where the cost of toxin in the safe food patch was equivalent to the perceived predation risk in the alternative patch .
4 .
At low toxin concentration , animals ate more from the safe than the risky patch .
As toxin concentration increased at the safe patch , intake shifted until animals ate mainly from the risky patch .
This shift was associated with behavioural changes : animals spent more time and fed longer at the risky patch , while vigilance increased at both risky and safe patches .
5 .
Our results demonstrate that the variation in toxin concentration , which occurs intraspecifically among plants , can critically influence the relative cost of predation risk on foraging .
We show that herbivores quantify , compare and balance these two different but proximate costs , altering their foraging patterns in the process .
This has potential ecological and evolutionary implications for the production of plant defence compounds in relation to spatial variation in predation risk to herbivores .
What determines variation in home range size across spatiotemporal scales in a large browsing herbivore ?
1 .
Most studies of intraspecific variation in home range size have investigated only a single or a few factors and often at one specific scale .
However , considering multiple spatial and temporal scales when defining a home range is important as mechanisms that affect variation in home range size may differ depending on the scale under investigation .
2 .
We aim to quantify the relative effect of various individual , forage and climatic determinants of variation in home range size across multiple spatiotemporal scales in a large browsing herbivore , the moose ( Alces:__entity__ alces:__entity__ ) , living at the southern limit of its distribution in Norway .
3 .
Total home range size and core home range areas were estimated for daily to monthly scales in summer and winter using both local convex hull ( LoCoH ) and fixed kernel home range methods .
Variance in home range size was analysed using linear mixed - effects models for repeated measurements .
4 .
Reproductive status was the most influential individual - level factor explaining variance in moose home range size , with females accompanied by a calf having smaller summer ranges across all scales .
Variation in home range size was strongly correlated with spatiotemporal changes in quantity and quality of natural food resources .
Home range size decreased with increasing browse density at daily scales , but the relationship changed to positive at longer temporal scales .
In contrast , browse quality was consistently negatively correlated with home range size except at the monthly scale during winter when depletion of high - quality forage occurs .
Local climate affected total home range size more than core areas .
Temperature , precipitation and snow depth influenced home range size directly at short temporal scales .
5 .
The relative effects of intrinsic and extrinsic determinants of variation in home range size differed with spatiotemporal scale , providing clear evidence that home range size is scale dependent in this large browser .
Insight into the behavioural responses of populations to climatic stochasticity and forage variability is essential in view of current and future climate change , especially for populations with thermoregulatory restrictions living at the southern limit of their distribution .
Npc1 is involved in sterol trafficking in the filamentous fungus Fusarium:__entity__ graminearum:__entity__ .
The ortholog of the human:__entity__ gene NPC1 was identified in the plant pathogenic , filamentous fungus Fusarium:__entity__ graminearum:__entity__ by shared amino acid sequence , protein domain structure and cellular localization of the mature fungal protein .
The FusariumNpc1 gene shares 34 % amino acid sequence identity and 51 % similarity to the human:__entity__ gene , has similar domain structure and is constitutively expressed , although up - regulated in ungerminated macroconidia and ascospores .
GFP - tagged Npc1p localizes to the fungal vacuolar membrane .
Cultures derived from a Deltanpc1 mutant strain contain significantly more ergosterol than cultures of the wildtype .
Staining with the fluorescent , sterol binding dye filipin , shows that ergosterol accumulates in vacuoles of the Deltanpc1 mutant but not the wildtype strain .
The Deltanpc1 mutant has a temperature dependent reduction in growth and greater sensitivity to the ergosterol synthesis inhibiting fungicide tebuconazole compared with the wildtype strain or the mutant complemented with wildtype Npc1 .
The mutant also is significantly reduced in pathogenicity to wheat:__entity__ .
Our results are consistent with the interpretation that Npc1p is important for normal transport of ergosterol from the vacuole and is essential for proper membrane function under particular environmental conditions .
Genetic diversity and phylogenetic position of the subclass Astomatia ( Ciliophora ) based on a sampling of six genera from West African oligochaetes ( Glossoscolecidae , Megascolecidae ) , including description of the new genus Paraclausilocola n . gen .
To more confidently assess phylogenetic relationships among astome ciliates , we obtained small subunit ( SSU ) rRNA sequences from nine species distributed in six genera and three families : Almophrya:__entity__ bivacuolata:__entity__ , Eudrilophrya:__entity__ complanata:__entity__ , Metaracoelophrya sp .
1 , Metaracoelophrya sp .
2 , Metaracoelophrya:__entity__ intermedia:__entity__ , Metaradiophrya sp . , Njinella:__entity__ prolifera:__entity__ , Paraclausilocola:__entity__ constricta:__entity__ n:__entity__ .:__entity__ gen:__entity__ .:__entity__ ,:__entity__ n:__entity__ .:__entity__ sp:__entity__ .:__entity__ , and Paraclausilocola:__entity__ elongata:__entity__ n:__entity__ .:__entity__ sp:__entity__ .:__entity__
The two new species in the proposed new clausilocolid genus Paraclausilocola n . gen .
are astomes with no attachment apparatus , two files of contractile vacuoles , and an arc - like anterior suture that has differentiations of thigmotactic ciliature on the anterior ends of the left kineties of the upper surface .
Phylogenetic analyses were undertaken using neighbor - joining , Bayesian inference , maximum likelihood , and maximum parsimony .
The nine species of astomes formed a strongly supported clade , showing the subclass Astomatia to be monophyletic and a weakly supported sister clade to the scuticociliates .
There were two strongly supported clades within the astomes .
However , genera assigned to the same family were found in different clades , and genera assigned to the same order were found in both clades .
Thus , astome taxa appear to be paraphyletic when morphology is used to assign species to genera .
Negotiating a noisy , information - rich environment in search of cryptic prey : olfactory predators need patchiness in prey cues .
1 .
Olfactory predator search processes differ fundamentally to those based on vision , particularly when odour cues are deposited rather than airborne or emanating from a point source .
When searching for visually cryptic prey that may have moved some distance from a deposited odour cue , cue context and spatial variability are the most likely sources of information about prey location available to an olfactory predator .
2 .
We tested whether the house:__entity__ mouse:__entity__ ( Mus:__entity__ domesticus:__entity__ ) , a model olfactory predator , would use cue context and spatial variability when searching for buried food items ; specifically , we tested the effect of varying cue patchiness , odour strength , and cue - prey association on mouse:__entity__ foraging success .
3 .
Within mouse:__entity__ - and predator - proof enclosures , we created grids of 100 sand - filled Petri dishes and buried peanut:__entity__ pieces in a set number of these patches to represent visually cryptic ' prey ' .
By adding peanut:__entity__ oil to selected dishes , we varied the spatial distribution of prey odour relative to the distribution of prey patches in each grid , to reflect different levels of cue patchiness ( Experiment 1 ) , odour strength ( Experiment 2 ) and cue - prey association ( Experiment 3 ) .
We measured the overnight foraging success of individual mice:__entity__ ( percentage of searched patches containing prey ) , as well as their foraging activity ( percentage of patches searched ) , and prey survival ( percentage of unsearched prey patches ) .
4 .
Mouse:__entity__ foraging success was highest where odour cues were patchy rather than uniform ( Experiment 1 ) , and where cues were tightly associated with prey location , rather than randomly or uniformly distributed ( Experiment 3 ) .
However , when cues at prey patches were ten times stronger than a uniformly distributed weak background odour , mice:__entity__ did not improve their foraging success over that experienced when cues were of uniform strength and distribution ( Experiment 2 ) .
5 .
These results suggest that spatial variability and cue context are important means by which olfactory predators can use deposited odour cues to locate visually cryptic prey .
They also indicate that chemical crypsis can disrupt these search processes as effectively as background matching in visually based predator - prey systems .
Behaviour during elevated water temperatures : can physiology explain movement of juvenile Atlantic:__entity__ salmon:__entity__ to cool water ?
1 .
Temperature governs most physiological processes in animals .
Ectotherms behaviourally thermoregulate by selecting habitats with temperatures regulating their body temperature for optimal physiological functioning .
However , ectotherms can experience temperature extremes forcing the organisms to seek temperature refuge .
2 .
Fish actively avoid potentially lethal temperatures by moving to cool - water sites created by inflowing tributaries and groundwater seeps .
Juvenile Atlantic:__entity__ salmon:__entity__ ( Salmo:__entity__ salar:__entity__ ) of different age classes exhibit different behavioural responses to elevated temperatures ( > 23 ^ 0C ) .
Yearling ( 1 + ) and 2 - year - old ( 2 + ) Atlantic:__entity__ salmon:__entity__ often cease feeding , abandon territorial behaviour and swim continuously in aggregations in cool - water sites ; whereas young - of - the - year ( 0 + ) fish continue defending territories and foraging .
3 .
This study determined whether the behavioural shift in older individuals ( 2 + ) occurred when basal metabolic rate , driven by increasing water temperature , reached the maximum metabolic rate such that anaerobic pathways were recruited to provide energy to support vital processes .
Behaviour ( feeding and stress responses ) , oxygen consumption , muscle lactate and glycogen , and circulating blood lactate and glucose concentrations were measured in wild 0 + and 2 + Atlantic:__entity__ salmon:__entity__ acclimated to water temperatures between 16 and 28 ^ 0C .
4 .
Results indicate that oxygen consumption of the 2 + fish increased with temperature and reached a plateau at 24 ^ 0C , a temperature that corresponded to cessation of feeding and a significant increase in muscle and blood lactate levels .
By contrast , oxygen consumption in 0 + fish did not reach a plateau , feeding continued and muscle lactate did not increase , even at the highest temperatures tested ( 28 ^ 0C ) .
5 .
To conclude , the experiment demonstrated that the 0 + and 2 + fish had different physiological responses to the elevated water temperatures .
The results suggest that wild 2 + Atlantic:__entity__ salmon:__entity__ employ behavioural responses ( e . g . movement to cool - water sites ) at elevated temperatures in an effort to mitigate physiological imbalances associated with an inability to support basal metabolism through aerobic metabolic processes .
Food web complexity and allometric scaling relationships in stream mesocosms : implications for experimentation .
1 .
Mesocosms are used extensively by ecologists to gain a mechanistic understanding of ecosystems based on the often untested assumption that these systems can replicate the key attributes of natural assemblages .
2 .
Previous investigations of stream mesocosm utility have explored community composition , but here for the first time , we extend the approach to consider the replicability and realism of food webs in four outdoor channels ( 4 m ( 2 ) ) .
3 .
The four food webs were similarly complex , consisting of diverse assemblages ( 61 - 71 taxa ) with dense feeding interactions ( directed connectance 0 . 09 - 0 . 11 ) .
Mesocosm food web structural attributes were within the range reported for 82 well - characterized food webs from natural streams and rivers .
When compared with 112 additional food webs from standing freshwater , marine , estuarine and terrestrial environments , stream food webs ( including mesocosms ) had similar characteristic path lengths , but typically lower mean food chain length and exponents for the species - link relationship .
4 .
Body size ( M ) abundance ( N ) allometric scaling coefficients for trivariate taxonomic mesocosm food webs ( - 0 . 53 to - 0 . 49 ) and individual size distributions ( - 0 . 60 to - 0 . 58 ) were consistent and similar to those from natural systems , suggesting that patterns of energy flux between mesocosm consumers and resources were realistic approximations .
5 .
These results suggest that stream mesocosms of this scale can support replicate food webs with a degree of biocomplexity that is comparable to ' natural ' streams .
The findings highlight the potential value of mesocosms as model systems for performing experimental manipulations to test ecological theories , at spatiotemporal scales of relevance to natural ecosystems .
Tuberculosis .
Tuberculosis results in an estimated 1 * 7 million deaths each year and the worldwide number of new cases ( more than 9 million ) is higher than at any other time in history .
22 low - income and middle - income countries account for more than 80 % of the active cases in the world .
Due to the devastating effect of HIV on susceptibility to tuberculosis , sub - Saharan Africa has been disproportionately affected and accounts for four of every five cases of HIV - associated tuberculosis .
In many regions highly endemic for tuberculosis , diagnosis continues to rely on century - old sputum microscopy ; there is no vaccine with adequate effectiveness and tuberculosis treatment regimens are protracted and have a risk of toxic effects .
Increasing rates of drug - resistant tuberculosis in eastern Europe , Asia , and sub - Saharan Africa now threaten to undermine the gains made by worldwide tuberculosis control programmes .
Moreover , our fundamental understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease is inadequate .
However , increased investment has allowed basic science and translational and applied research to produce new data , leading to promising progress in the development of improved tuberculosis diagnostics , biomarkers of disease activity , drugs , and vaccines .
The growing scientific momentum must be accompanied by much greater investment and political commitment to meet this huge persisting challenge to public health .
Our Seminar presents current perspectives on the scale of the epidemic , the pathogen and the host response , present and emerging methods for disease control ( including diagnostics , drugs , biomarkers , and vaccines ) , and the ongoing challenge of tuberculosis control in adults in the 21st century .
Characterization of an omega - class glutathione S - transferase in the stress response of the silkmoth:__entity__ .
The glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) superfamily is involved in detoxification of various xenobiotics .
Using real - time PCR , mRNA encoding an omega - class GST of Bombyx:__entity__ mori:__entity__ ( bmGSTO ) was shown to be induced after exposure to various environmental stresses .
A soluble form of recombinant protein ( rbmGSTO ) was functionally overexpressed in Escherichia:__entity__ coli:__entity__ cells and purified to homogeneity .
Cys 38 and Pro 39 were found to be highly conserved in omega - class GSTs , and their roles were investigated by site - directed mutagenesis / kinetic analysis .
Mutations of Cys 38 and Pro 39 residues affected the catalytic efficiency of enzymes , indicating that the presence of Cys 38 and Pro 39 residues is important for bmGSTO activity .
Thus , bmGSTO could contribute to increasing the environmental stress resistance of lepidopteran insects .
Treatment advances in neonatal neuroprotection and neurointensive care .
Knowledge of the nature , prognosis , and ways to treat brain lesions in neonatal infants has increased remarkably .
Neonatal hypoxic - ischaemic encephalopathy ( HIE ) in term infants , mirrors a progressive cascade of excito - oxidative events that unfold in the brain after an asphyxial insult .
In the laboratory , this cascade can be blocked to protect brain tissue through the process of neuroprotection .
However , proof of a clinical effect was lacking until the publication of three positive randomised controlled trials of moderate hypothermia for term infants with HIE .
These results have greatly improved treatment prospects for babies with asphyxia and altered understanding of the theory of neuroprotection .
The studies show that moderate hypothermia within 6 h of asphyxia improves survival without cerebral palsy or other disability by about 40 % and reduces death or neurological disability by nearly 30 % .
The search is on to discover adjuvant treatments that can further enhance the effects of hypothermia .
Origin and evolution of the canal raphe system in diatoms .
One lineage of pennate diatoms has a slit through the siliceous cell wall , called a " raphe , " that functions in motility .
Raphid pennate diatoms number in the perhaps tens of thousands of species , with the diversity of raphe forms potentially matching this number .
Three lineages - the Bacillariales , Rhopalodiales , and Surirellales - possess a complex and presumably highly derived raphe that is physically separated from the cell interior , most often by a set of siliceous braces .
Because the relationship among these three lineages is unclear , the number of origins of the canal raphe system and the homology of it and its constitutive parts among these lineages , is equally unclear .
We reconstructed the phylogeny of raphid pennate diatoms and included , for the first time , members of all three canal raphid diatom lineages , and used the phylogeny to test specific hypotheses about the origin of the canal raphe .
The canal raphe appears to have evolved twice , once in the common ancestor of Bacillariales and once in the common ancestor of Rhopalodiales and Surirellales , which form a monophyletic group in our analyses .
These results recommend careful follow - up morphogenesis studies of the canal raphe in these two lineages to determine the underlying developmental basis for this remarkable case of parallel evolution .
Osteoporosis : now and the future .
Osteoporosis is a common disease characterised by a systemic impairment of bone mass and microarchitecture that results in fragility fractures .
With an ageing population , the medical and socioeconomic effect of osteoporosis , particularly postmenopausal osteoporosis , will increase further .
A detailed knowledge of bone biology with molecular insights into the communication between bone - forming osteoblasts and bone - resorbing osteoclasts and the orchestrating signalling network has led to the identification of novel therapeutic targets .
Novel treatment strategies have been developed that aim to inhibit excessive bone resorption and increase bone formation .
The most promising novel treatments include : denosumab , a monoclonal antibody for receptor activator of NF - kappaB ligand , a key osteoclast cytokine ; odanacatib , a specific inhibitor of the osteoclast protease cathepsin K ; and antibodies against the proteins sclerostin and dickkopf - 1 , two endogenous inhibitors of bone formation .
This overview discusses these novel therapies and explains their underlying physiology .
Increasing burden of liver disease in patients with HIV infection .
Introduction of effective combined antiretroviral therapy has made HIV infection a chronic illness .
Substantial reductions in the number of AIDS - related deaths have been accompanied by an increase in liver - related morbidity and mortality due to co - infection with chronic hepatitis B and C viruses .
Increases in non - alcoholic fatty liver disease and drug - induced hepatotoxicity , together with development of hepatocellular carcinoma , also potentiate the burden of liver disease in individuals with HIV infection .
We provide an overview of the key causes , disease mechanisms of pathogenesis , and recommendations for treatment options including the evolving role of liver transplantation .
Adaptive trade - offs in juvenile salmonid metabolism associated with habitat partitioning between coho:__entity__ salmon:__entity__ and steelhead:__entity__ trout:__entity__ in coastal streams .
1 .
Adaptive trade - offs are fundamental to the evolution of diversity and the coexistence of similar taxa and occur when complimentary combinations of traits maximize efficiency of resource exploitation or survival at different points on environmental gradients .
2 .
Standard metabolic rate ( SMR ) is a key physiological trait that reflects adaptations to baseline metabolic performance , whereas active metabolism reflects adaptations to variable metabolic output associated with performance related to foraging , predator avoidance , aggressive interactions or migratory movements .
Benefits of high SMR and active metabolism may change along a resource ( productivity ) gradient , indicating that a trade - off exists among active metabolism , resting metabolism and energy intake .
3 .
We measured and compared SMR , maximal metabolic rate ( MMR ) , aerobic scope ( AS ) , swim performance ( UCrit ) and growth of juvenile hatchery and wild steelhead:__entity__ and coho:__entity__ salmon:__entity__ held on high - and low - food rations in order to better understand the potential significance of variation in SMR to growth , differentiation between species , and patterns of habitat use along a productivity gradient .
4 .
We found that differences in SMR , MMR , AS , swim performance and growth rate between steelhead:__entity__ trout:__entity__ and coho:__entity__ salmon:__entity__ were reduced in hatchery - reared fish compared with wild fish .
Wild steelhead:__entity__ had a higher MMR , AS , swim performance and growth rate than wild coho:__entity__ , but adaptations between species do not appear to involve differences in SMR or to trade - off increased growth rate against lower swim performance , as commonly observed for high - growth strains .
Instead , we hypothesize that wild steelhead:__entity__ may be trading off higher growth rate for lower food consumption efficiency , similar to strategies adopted by anadromous vs . resident brook:__entity__ trout:__entity__ and Atlantic:__entity__ salmon:__entity__ vs . brook:__entity__ trout:__entity__ .
This highlights potential differences in food consumption and digestion strategies as cryptic adaptations ecologically differentiating salmonid species .
5 .
We hypothesize that divergent digestive strategies , which are common and well documented among terrestrial vertebrates , may be an important but overlooked aspect of adaptive strategies of juvenile salmonids , and fish in general .
Natal conditions alter age - specific reproduction but not survival or senescence in a long - lived bird of prey .
1 .
Natal conditions and senescence are two major factors shaping life - history traits of wild animals .
However , such factors have rarely been investigated together , and it remains largely unknown whether they interact to affect age - specific performance .
2 .
We used 27 years of longitudinal data collected on tawny:__entity__ owls:__entity__ with estimates of prey density ( field voles ) from Kielder Forest ( UK ) to investigate how prey density at birth affects ageing patterns in reproduction and survival .
3 .
Natal conditions experienced by tawny:__entity__ owls:__entity__ , measured in terms of vole density , dramatically varied among cohorts and explained 87 % of the deviance in first - year apparent survival ( annual estimates ranging from 0 * 07 to 0 * 33 ) .
4 .
We found evidence for senescence in survival for females as well as for males .
Model - averaged estimates showed that adult survival probability declined linearly with age for females from age 1 .
In contrast , male survival probability , lower on average than for female , declined after a plateau at age 1 - 3 .
5 .
We also found evidence for reproductive senescence ( number of offspring ) .
For females , reproductive performance increased until age 9 then declined .
Males showed an earlier decline in reproductive performance with an onset of senescence at age 3 .
6 .
Long - lasting effects of natal environmental conditions were sex specific .
Female reproductive performance was substantially related to natal conditions ( difference of 0 * 24 fledgling per breeding event between females born in the first or third quartile of vole density ) , whereas male performance was not .
We found no evidence for tawny:__entity__ owls:__entity__ born in years with low prey density having accelerated rates of senescence .
7 .
Our results , combined with previous findings , suggest the way natal environmental conditions affect senescence varies not only across species but also within species according to gender and the demographic trait considered .
Post - splenectomy and hyposplenic states .
The spleen is crucial in regulating immune homoeostasis through its ability to link innate and adaptive immunity and in protecting against infections .
The impairment of splenic function is defined as hyposplenism , an acquired disorder caused by several haematological and immunological diseases .
The term asplenia refers to the absence of the spleen , a condition that is rarely congenital and mostly post - surgical .
Although hyposplenism and asplenia might predispose individuals to thromboembolic events , in this Review we focus on infectious complications , which are the most widely recognised consequences of these states .
Because of the high mortality , the fulminant course , and the refractoriness to common treatment of overwhelming infections caused by encapsulated bacteria , prevention through vaccination and antibiotic prophylaxis is the basis of the management of patients who have had splenectomy or have hyposplenism .
In this Review , we critically assess clinical and diagnostic aspects of splenic dysfunction and highlight new perspectives in the prevention of overwhelming post - splenectomy infections .
Priority actions for the non - communicable disease crisis .
The UN High - Level Meeting on Non - Communicable Diseases ( NCDs ) in September , 2011 , is an unprecedented opportunity to create a sustained global movement against premature death and preventable morbidity and disability from NCDs , mainly heart disease , stroke , cancer , diabetes , and chronic respiratory disease .
The increasing global crisis in NCDs is a barrier to development goals including poverty reduction , health equity , economic stability , and human:__entity__ security .
The Lancet NCD Action Group and the NCD Alliance propose five overarching priority actions for the response to the crisis - - leadership , prevention , treatment , international cooperation , and monitoring and accountability - - and the delivery of five priority interventions - - tobacco:__entity__ control , salt reduction , improved diets and physical activity , reduction in hazardous alcohol intake , and essential drugs and technologies .
The priority interventions were chosen for their health effects , cost - effectiveness , low costs of implementation , and political and financial feasibility .
The most urgent and immediate priority is tobacco:__entity__ control .
We propose as a goal for 2040 , a world essentially free from tobacco:__entity__ where less than 5 % of people use tobacco .
Implementation of the priority interventions , at an estimated global commitment of about US $ 9 billion per year , will bring enormous benefits to social and economic development and to the health sector .
If widely adopted , these interventions will achieve the global goal of reducing NCD death rates by 2 % per year , averting tens of millions of premature deaths in this decade .
Serotype replacement in disease after pneumococcal vaccination .
Vaccination with heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PCV7 ) has significantly reduced the burden of pneumococcal disease and has had an important public health benefit .
Because this vaccine targets only seven of the more than 92 pneumococcal serotypes , concerns have been raised that non - vaccine serotypes ( NVTs ) could increase in prevalence and reduce the benefits of vaccination .
Indeed , among asymptomatic carriers , the prevalence of NVTs has increased substantially , and consequently , there has been little or no net change in the bacterial carriage prevalence .
In many populations , pneumococcal disease caused by NVT has increased , but in most cases this increase has been less than the increase in NVT carriage .
We review the evidence for serotype replacement in carriage and disease , and address the surveillance biases that might affect these findings .
We then discuss possible reasons for the discrepancy between near - complete replacement in carriage and partial replacement for disease , including differences in invasiveness between vaccine serotypes .
We contend that the magnitude of serotype replacement in disease can be attributed , in part , to a combination of lower invasiveness of the replacing serotypes , biases in the pre - vaccine carriage data ( unmasking ) , and biases in the disease surveillance systems that could underestimate the true amount of replacement .
We conclude by discussing the future potential for serotype replacement in disease and the need for continuing surveillance .
Stillbirths : how can health systems deliver for mothers and babies ?
The causes of stillbirths are inseparable from the causes of maternal and neonatal deaths .
This report focuses on prevention of stillbirths by scale - up of care for mothers and babies at the health - system level , with consideration for effects and cost .
In countries with high mortality rates , emergency obstetric care has the greatest effect on maternal and neonatal deaths , and on stillbirths .
Syphilis detection and treatment is of moderate effect but of lower cost and is highly feasible .
Advanced antenatal care , including induction for post - term pregnancies , and detection and management of hypertensive disease , fetal growth restriction , and gestational diabetes , will further reduce mortality , but at higher cost .
These interventions are best packaged and provided through linked service delivery methods tailored to suit existing health - care systems .
If 99 % coverage is reached in 68 priority countries by 2015 , up to 1 * 1 million ( 45 % ) third - trimester stillbirths , 201 000 ( 54 % ) maternal deaths , and 1 * 4 million ( 43 % ) neonatal deaths could be saved per year at an additional total cost of US $ 10 * 9 billion or $ 2 * 32 per person , which is in the range of $ 0 * 96 - 2 * 32 for other ingredients - based intervention packages with only recurrent costs .
The contribution of the S - phase checkpoint genes MEC1 and SGS1 to genome stability maintenance in Candida:__entity__ albicans:__entity__ .
Genome rearrangements , a common feature of Candida:__entity__ albicans:__entity__ isolates , are often associated with the acquisition of antifungal drug resistance .
In Saccharomyces:__entity__ cerevisiae:__entity__ , perturbations in the S - phase checkpoints result in the same sort of Gross Chromosomal Rearrangements ( GCRs ) observed in C:__entity__ .:__entity__ albicans:__entity__ .
Several proteins are involved in the S:__entity__ .:__entity__ cerevisiae:__entity__ cell cycle checkpoints , including Mec1p , a protein kinase of the PIKK ( phosphatidyl inositol 3 - kinase - like kinase ) family and the central player in the DNA damage checkpoint .
Sgs1p , the ortholog of BLM , the Bloom ' s syndrome gene , is a RecQ - related DNA helicase ; cells from BLM patients are characterized by an increase in genome instability .
Yeast:__entity__ strains bearing deletions in MEC1 or SGS1 are viable ( in contrast to the inviability seen with loss of MEC1 in S:__entity__ .:__entity__ cerevisiae:__entity__ ) but the different deletion mutants have significantly different phenotypes .
The mec1Delta / Delta colonies have a wild - type colony morphology , while the sgs1Delta / Delta mutants are slow - growing , producing wrinkled colonies with pseudohyphal - like cells .
The mec1Delta / Delta mutants are only sensitive to ethylmethane sulfonate ( EMS ) , methylmethane sulfonate ( MMS ) , and hydroxyurea ( HU ) but the sgs1Delta / Delta mutants exhibit a high sensitivity to all DNA - damaging agents tested .
In an assay for chromosome 1 integrity , the mec1Delta / Delta mutants exhibit an increase in genome instability ; no change was observed in the sgs1Delta / Delta mutants .
Finally , loss of MEC1 does not affect sensitivity to the antifungal drug fluconazole , while loss of SGS1 leads to an increased susceptibility to fluconazole .
Neither deletion elevated the level of antifungal drug resistance acquisition .
Postural deformities in Parkinson ' s disease .
Postural deformities are frequent and disabling complications of Parkinson ' s disease ( PD ) and atypical parkinsonism .
These deformities include camptocormia , antecollis , Pisa syndrome , and scoliosis .
Recognition of specific postural syndromes might have differential diagnostic value in patients presenting with parkinsonism .
The evidence to date suggests that postural deformities have a multifactorial pathophysiology .
Contributing factors include muscular rigidity ; axial dystonia ; weakness caused by myopathy ; body scheme defects due to centrally impaired proprioception ; and structural changes in the spine .
The relative contribution of these different factors varies between patients and across specific syndromes .
Improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying postural deformities in PD might ultimately lead us to more effective management strategies for these disabling and drug - refractory complications .
Tortricid moths reared from the invasive weed Mexican:__entity__ palo:__entity__ verde:__entity__ , Parkinsonia:__entity__ aculeata:__entity__ , with comments on their host specificity , biology , geographic distribution , and systematics .
As part of efforts to identify native herbivores of Mexican:__entity__ palo:__entity__ verde:__entity__ , Parkinsonia:__entity__ aculeata:__entity__ L .
( Leguminosae : Caesalpinioideae ) , as potential biological control agents against this invasive weed in Australia , ten species of Tortricidae ( Lepidoptera ) were reared from Guatemala , Mexico , Nicaragua , and Venezuela : Amorbia concavana ( Zeller ) , Platynota rostrana ( Walker ) , Platynota helianthes ( Meyrick ) , Platynota:__entity__ stultana:__entity__ Walsingham ( all Tortricinae : Sparganothini ) , Rudenia leguminana ( Busck ) , Cochylis sp .
( both Tortricinae : Cochylini ) , Ofatulena duodecemstriata ( Walsingham ) , O . luminosa Heinrich , Ofatulena sp .
( all Olethreutinae : Grapholitini ) , and Crocidosema lantana Busck ( Olethreutinae : Eucosmini ) .
Significant geographic range extensions are provided for O . duodecemstriata and R . leguminana .
These are the first documented records of P:__entity__ .:__entity__ aculeata:__entity__ as a host plant for all but O . luminosa .
The four species of Sparganothini are polyphagous ; in contrast , the two Cochylini and three Grapholitini likely are specialists on Leguminosae .
Ofatulena luminosa is possibly host specific on P:__entity__ .:__entity__ aculeata:__entity__ .
Host trials with Rudenia leguminana also provide some evidence of specificity , in contrast to historical rearing records .
To examine the possibility that R . leguminana is a complex of species , two data sets of molecular markers were examined : ( 1 ) a combined data set of two mitochondrial markers ( a 781 - basepair region of cytochrome c oxidase I ( COI ) and a 685 - basepair region of cytochrome c oxidase II ) and one nuclear marker ( a 531 - basepair region of the 28S domain 2 ) ; and ( 2 ) the 650 - basepair & quot ; barcode & quot ; region of COI .
Analyses of both data sets strongly suggest that individuals examined in this study belong to more than one species .
Evidence for the higher importance of signal size over body size in aposematic signaling in insects .
To understand the evolution of warning coloration , it is important to distinguish between different aspects of conspicuous color patterns .
As an example , both pattern element size and body size of prey have been shown to enhance the effectiveness of warning signals .
However , it is unclear whether the effect of body size is merely a side effect of proportionally increasing pattern elements , or if there is an effect of body size per se .
These possibilities were evaluated by offering different sized artificial caterpillars with either fixed or proportionally increasing aposematic color signal elements to wild great:__entity__ tits:__entity__ , Parus:__entity__ major:__entity__ L:__entity__ .:__entity__
( Passeriformes : Paridae ) .
The birds ' hesitation time to attack each & quot ; caterpillar & quot ; was used as a measure of the warning effect .
The hesitation time showed a significant , positive size - dependence with the caterpillars whose pattern elements increased proportionally with their body size .
In contrast , no size dependence was found in the larvae with fixed - size signal elements .
Such a difference in mortality curves is consistent with the idea that pattern element size is a more important aspect than body size in enhancing a warning signal .
Since no evidence of an effect of body size per se on signal efficiency was found , this study does not support the hypothesis that aposematic insects gain more from large size than cryptic ones .
Wolbachia wSinvictaA:__entity__ infections in natural populations of the fire:__entity__ ant:__entity__ Solenopsis:__entity__ invicta:__entity__ : testing for phenotypic effects .
Wolbachia are intracellular bacteria that commonly infect many arthropods and some nematodes .
In arthropods , these maternally transmitted bacteria often induce a variety of phenotypic effects to enhance their own spread within host populations .
Wolbachia phenotypic effects generally either provide benefits to infected host females ( cytoplasmic incompatibility , positive fitness effects ) or bias host sex ratio in favor of females ( male - killing , parthenogenesis , feminization ) , all of which increase the relative production of infected females in host populations .
Wolbachia surveys have found infections to be exceedingly common in ants , but little is known at this juncture as to what phenotypic effects , if any , they induce in this group .
Previous studies have demonstrated that individuals from native populations of the invasive fire:__entity__ ant:__entity__ Solenopsis:__entity__ invicta:__entity__ commonly harbor one or more of three Wolbachia variants .
One of the variants , wSinvictaA , typically occurs at low prevalence in S:__entity__ .:__entity__ invicta:__entity__ populations , appears to have been transmitted horizontally into S:__entity__ .:__entity__ invicta:__entity__ three or more times , and has been lost repeatedly from host lineages over time .
In order to determine the phenotypic effects and likely population dynamics of wSinvictaA:__entity__ infections in these ants , brood production patterns of newly mated fire:__entity__ ant:__entity__ queens were studied during simulated claustral founding and measured wSinvictaA:__entity__ transmission fidelity within mature single - queen families .
No clear evidence was found for Wolbachia - induced cytoplasmic incompatibility , significant fitness effects , or male - killing .
Maternal transmission was perfect to both virgin queens and males .
Possible mechanisms for how this variant could be maintained in host populations are discussed .
Growth inhibition of Beauveria:__entity__ bassiana:__entity__ by bacteria isolated from the cuticular surface of the corn:__entity__ leafhopper:__entity__ , Dalbulus:__entity__ maidis:__entity__ and the planthopper , Delphacodes:__entity__ kuscheli:__entity__ , two important vectors of maize pathogens .
The phytosanitary importance of the corn:__entity__ leafhopper , Dalbulus maidis ( De Long and Wolcott ) ( Hemiptera : Cicadellidae ) and the planthopper , Delphacodes kuscheli Fennah ( Hemiptera : Delphacidae ) lies in their ability to transmit phloem - associated plant pathogens , mainly viruses and mollicutes , and to cause considerable mechanical damage to corn plants during feeding and oviposition .
Fungi , particularly some members of the Ascomycota , are likely candidates for biocontrol agents against these insect pests , but several studies revealed their failure to invade the insect cuticle possibly because of the presence of inhibitory compounds such as phenols , quinones , and lipids and also by the antibiosis effect of the microbiota living on the cuticular surface of the host .
The present work aims to understand interactions between the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria:__entity__ bassiana:__entity__ ( Balsamao - Crivelli ) Vuillemin ( Hypocreales : Cordycipitaceae ) and bacterial antagonists isolated from the cuticular surface of D:__entity__ .:__entity__ maidis:__entity__ and D:__entity__ .:__entity__ kuscheli:__entity__ .
A total of 155 bacterial isolates were recovered from the insect ' s cuticle and tested against B:__entity__ .:__entity__ bassiana:__entity__ .
Ninety - one out of 155 strains inhibited the growth of B:__entity__ .:__entity__ bassiana:__entity__ .
Bacterial strains isolated from D:__entity__ .:__entity__ maidis:__entity__ were significantly more antagonistic against B:__entity__ .:__entity__ bassiana:__entity__ than those isolates from D:__entity__ .:__entity__ kuscheli:__entity__ .
Among the most effective antagonistic strains , six isolates of Bacillus:__entity__ thuringiensis:__entity__ Berliner ( Bacillales : Bacillaeae ( after B:__entity__ .:__entity__ subtilis:__entity__ ) ) , one isolate of B:__entity__ .:__entity__ mycoides:__entity__ Flugge , eight isolates of B:__entity__ .:__entity__ megaterium:__entity__ de Bary , five isolates of B:__entity__ .:__entity__ pumilus:__entity__ Meyer and Gottheil , one isolate of B:__entity__ .:__entity__ licheniformis:__entity__ ( Weigmann ) Chester , and four isolates of B:__entity__ .:__entity__ subtilis:__entity__ ( Ehrenberg ) Cohn were identified .
Mig1 is involved in mycelial formation and expression of the genes encoding extracellular enzymes in Saccharomycopsis:__entity__ fibuligera:__entity__ A11 .
The MIG1 gene of Saccharomycopsis:__entity__ fibuligera:__entity__ A11 was cloned from its genomic DNA using the degenerated primers and inverse PCR .
The MIG1 gene ( 1152bp , accession number : HM450676 ) encoded a 384 - amino acid protein very similar to Mig1s from other fungi .
Besides their highly conserved zinc fingers , the Mig1 proteins displayed short conserved motifs of possible significance in glucose repression .
The MIG1 gene in S:__entity__ .:__entity__ fibuligera:__entity__ A11 was disrupted by integrating the HPT ( hygromycin B phosphotransferase ) gene into ORF ( Open Reading Frame ) of the MIG1 gene .
The disruptant A11 - c obtained could grow in the media containing hygromycin and 2 - deoxy - d - glucose , respectively .
alpha - Amylase , glucoamylse , acid protease and Beta - glucosidase production by the disruptant and expression of their genes in the disruptant were greatly enhanced .
This confirms that Mig1 , the transcriptional repressor , indeed regulates expression of the genes and production of the extracellular enzymes in S:__entity__ .:__entity__ fibuligera:__entity__ A11 .
At the same time , it was found that cell budding was enhanced and mycelial formation was reduced in the disruptant .
Morphological differences and molecular phylogeny of freshwater blooming species , Peridiniopsis spp .
( Dinophyceae ) from China .
In 2008 - 2010 , several freshwater dinoflagellate blooms caused by Peridiniopsis spp . were observed in China .
P:__entity__ .:__entity__ penardii:__entity__ and P:__entity__ .:__entity__ niei:__entity__ sampled from various geographical localities were examined by means of light and scanning electron microscopy .
After comparing morphological and molecular differences , the new freshwater variety Peridiniopsis penardii var . robusta var . nov .
( Peridiniales , Dinophyceae ) found in Manwan Reservoir , Yunnan Province was described .
The new variety differed from P . penardii since it possessed numerous robust antapical spines and a conspicuous apical spine .
Molecular phylogenetic analyses based on SSU , LSU and ITS indicated P:__entity__ .:__entity__ niei:__entity__ , P . penardii and P . penardii var . robusta were closely related with P . kevei , and clustered into a monophyletic clade .
The new variety possessed an endosymbiotic diatom which was similar to P . penardii and P . kevei , whereas the endosymbiont was not present in cells of P:__entity__ .:__entity__ niei:__entity__ .
The endosymbiont SSU and ITS phylogenies showed that the endosymbionts of these three dinoflagellates were closely related to members of Thalassiosirales .
Furthermore it was concluded that the endosymbionts might originate from Discostella - like species .
Beta - Thymosin is upregulated by the steroid hormone 20 - hydroxyecdysone and microorganisms .
Thymosins have diverse biological activities including actin - sequestering and tissue repair in vertebrates , however , there is little information about the function of thymosins in invertebrates .
We isolated a Beta - thymosin gene in Helicoverpa:__entity__ armigera:__entity__ .
It has two transcript variants , HaTHY1 and HaTHY2 , encoding 19 . 0 kDa and 14 . 5 kDa peptides , respectively .
HaTHY1 was mainly transcribed in the integument and midgut , while HaTHY2 was principally presented in the fat body and haemocytes .
The transcript levels of HaTHY2 showed some fluctuation ; there was an obvious increase at the metamorphic stage in the integument or fat body .
HaTHY was able to be upregulated by 20 - hydroxyecdysone or by bacterial and viral challenge .
These data suggest that HaTHY is upregulated by the steroid hormone and by responses to microorganism infection .
The cell cycle gene MoCDC15 regulates hyphal growth , asexual development and plant infection in the rice:__entity__ blast:__entity__ pathogen:__entity__ Magnaporthe:__entity__ oryzae:__entity__ .
Rice blast , caused by the pathogen Magnaporthe:__entity__ oryzae:__entity__ , is a serious hindrance to rice:__entity__ production and has emerged as an important model for the characterization of molecular mechanisms relevant to pathogenic development in plants .
Similar to other pathogenic fungi , conidiation plays a central role in initiation of M:__entity__ .:__entity__ oryzae:__entity__ infection and spread over a large area .
However , relatively little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms that underlie conidiation in M:__entity__ .:__entity__ oryzae:__entity__ .
To better characterize these mechanisms , we identified a conidiation - defective mutant , ATMT0225B6:__entity__ ( MoCDC15:__entity__ (:__entity__ T:__entity__ -:__entity__ DNA:__entity__ ):__entity__ ) , in which a T - DNA insertion disrupted a gene that encodes a homolog of fission yeast:__entity__ cdc15 , and generated a second strain containing a disruption in the same allele ( DeltaMoCDC15 ( T - DNA ) ) .
The cdc15 gene has been shown to act as a coordinator of the cell cycle in yeast:__entity__ .
Functional analysis of the MoCDC15 ( T - DNA ) and DeltaMoCDC15 ( T - DNA ) mutants revealed that MoCDC15 is required for conidiation , preinfection development and pathogenicity in M:__entity__ .:__entity__ oryzae:__entity__ .
Conidia from these mutants were viable , but failed to adhere to hydrophobic surface , a crucial step required for subsequent pathogenic development .
All phenotypic defects observed in mutants were rescued in a strain complemented with wild:__entity__ type:__entity__ MoCDC15:__entity__ .
Together , these data indicate that MoCDC15 functions as a coordinator of several biological processes important for pathogenic development in M:__entity__ .:__entity__ oryzae:__entity__ .
Inactivation of a macronuclear intra - S - phase checkpoint in Tetrahymena:__entity__ thermophila:__entity__ with caffeine affects the integrity of the micronuclear genome .
Aphidicolin ( APH ) , an inhibitor of DNA polymerase alpha , arrested cell divisions in Tetrahymena:__entity__ thermophila:__entity__ .
Surprisingly , low concentrations of APH induced an increase of macronuclear DNA content and cell size in non - dividing cells .
In spite of the cell size increase , most proliferation of basal bodies , ciliogenesis and development of new oral primordia were prevented by the APH treatment .
The division arrest induced by APH was partly overridden by caffeine ( CAF ) treatment , which caused the fragmentation ( " pulverization " ) of the chromosomes in G2 micronuclei .
Somatic progeny of dividers with pulverized micronuclei ( APH + CAF strains ) contained aneuploid and amicronucleate cells .
The amicronucleate cells , after losing their oral structures and most of their cilia , and undergoing progressive disorganization of cortical structures , assumed an irregular shape ( " crinkled " ) and were nonviable .
" Crinkled " cells were not formed after APH + CAF treatment of the amicronuclear BI3840 strain , which contains some mic - specific sequences in its macronucleus .
Most of the APH + CAF strains had a typical " * " - like conjugation phenotype : they did not produce pronuclei , but received them unilaterally from their mates and retained old macronuclei .
However , 4 among 100 APH + CAF clones induced arrest at meiotic metaphase I in their wt mates .
It is likely that the origin of such clones was enhanced by chromosome pulverization .
Analysis of the Fusarium:__entity__ graminearum:__entity__ species:__entity__ complex:__entity__ from wheat:__entity__ , barley:__entity__ and maize:__entity__ in South Africa provides evidence of species - specific differences in host preference .
Species identity and trichothecene toxin potential of 560 members of the Fusarium:__entity__ graminearum:__entity__ species:__entity__ complex:__entity__ ( FGSC:__entity__ ) collected from diseased wheat:__entity__ , barley:__entity__ and maize:__entity__ in South Africa was determined using a microsphere - based multilocus genotyping assay .
Although three trichothecene types ( 3 - ADON , 15 - ADON and NIV ) were represented among these isolates , strains with the 15 - ADON type predominated on all three hosts .
A significant difference , however , was identified in the composition of FGSC:__entity__ pathogens associated with Gibberella ear rot ( GER ) of maize:__entity__ as compared to Fusarium head blight ( FHB ) of wheat:__entity__ or barley:__entity__ ( P & lt ; 0 . 001 ) .
F:__entity__ .:__entity__ graminearum:__entity__ accounted for more than 85 % of the FGSC:__entity__ isolates associated with FHB of wheat:__entity__ and barley:__entity__ ( N = 425 ) , and was also the dominant species among isolates from maize:__entity__ roots ( N = 35 ) .
However , with the exception of a single isolate identified as an interspecific hybrid between Fusariumboothii:__entity__ and F:__entity__ .:__entity__ graminearum:__entity__ , GER of maize:__entity__ ( N = 100 ) was exclusively associated with F:__entity__ .:__entity__ boothii:__entity__ .
The predominance of F:__entity__ .:__entity__ graminearum:__entity__ among FHB isolates , and the near exclusivity of F:__entity__ .:__entity__ boothii:__entity__ among GER isolates , was observed across all cultivars , collection dates , and provinces sampled .
Because these results suggest a difference in host preference among species of the FGSC:__entity__ , we hypothesize that F:__entity__ .:__entity__ graminearum:__entity__ may be less well adapted to infect maize:__entity__ ears than other members of the FGSC:__entity__ .
Suitability of different media for in vitro cultivation of the ruminal protozoa species Entodinium:__entity__ caudatum:__entity__ , Eudiplodinium:__entity__ maggii:__entity__ , and Epidinium:__entity__ ecaudatum:__entity__ .
Three protozoal cultivation media were tested to determine the medium which best facilitated growth and viability of key B - type ciliates isolated from the sheep rumen .
Entodinium:__entity__ caudatum:__entity__ and Eudiplodinium:__entity__ maggii:__entity__ were grown anaerobically in 50 - ml flasks for 32 days in Caudatum - type ( C ) , Kisidayova ( K ) or Dehority ( M ) medium .
On day 32 , in media K and M , E:__entity__ .:__entity__ caudatum:__entity__ cell counts were high with 5 . 6x10 ( 3 ) and 7 . 8x10 ( 3 ) mL ( - 1 ) , respectively , and the proportion of dead cells was low with 0 . 6 and 1 . 4 % , respectively .
E:__entity__ .:__entity__ maggii:__entity__ concentrations when grown in medium M and C were 2 . 7x10 ( 3 ) and 2 . 4x10 ( 3 ) mL ( - 1 ) , respectively , with 3 . 9 and 14 . 1 % dead cells .
Medium M , which favoured growth of both protozoa species , was tested again and Epidinium:__entity__ ecaudatum:__entity__ was included .
Protozoa were grown for a 4 - month period and samples were taken in the last two months on days 1 , 7 , 35 and 57 .
Average cell concentrations were 10 . 0 , 0 . 8 and 0 . 5x10 ( 3 ) mL ( - 1 ) for E:__entity__ .:__entity__ caudatum:__entity__ , E:__entity__ .:__entity__ maggii:__entity__ , and E:__entity__ .:__entity__ ecaudatum:__entity__ , respectively .
In conclusion , medium M would appear to be the best choice for cultivating these three species in one medium .
Synganglion transcriptome and developmental global gene expression in adult females of the American:__entity__ dog:__entity__ tick:__entity__ , Dermacentor:__entity__ variabilis:__entity__ ( Acari : Ixodidae ) .
454 Pyrosequencing was used to characterize the expressed genes from the synganglion and associated neurosecretory organs of unfed and partially fed virgin and mated replete females of the American:__entity__ dog:__entity__ tick:__entity__ , Dermacentor:__entity__ variabilis:__entity__ .
A total of 14 , 881 contiguous sequences ( contigs ) was assembled , with an average size of 229 bp .
Gene ontology terms for Level 2 biological processes were assigned to 4366 contigs .
Seven acetylcholinesterases , a muscarinic acetylcholine ( ACh ) receptor , two nicotinic ACh receptor Beta - subunits , two ACh unc - 18 regulators , two dopamine receptors , two gamma aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) receptors , two GABA transporters , two norepinephrine transporters and an octopamine receptor are described .
Microarrays were conducted to examine global gene expression and quantitative real - time polymerase chain reaction was used to verify expression of selected neuropeptides .
Hierarchical clustering of all differentially expressed transcripts grouped part - fed and replete ticks as being more similar in terms of differentially expressed genes with unfed ticks as the outgroup .
Nine putative neuropeptides ( allatostatin , bursicon - Beta , preprocorazonin , glycoprotein hormone alpha , insulin - like peptide , three orcokinins , preprosulphakinin ) and a gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor were differentially expressed , and their developmental expression and role in reproduction was investigated .
The presence of eclosion hormone , corazonin and bursicon in the synganglion , which in insects regulate behaviour and cuticle development associated with moulting , suggest that this system may be used in ticks to regulate blood feeding , cuticle expansion and development related to female reproduction ; adult ticks do not moult .
Endogenous regulation of the growth - rate responses of a spring - dwelling strain of the freshwater alga , Chlorella:__entity__ minutissima:__entity__ , to light and temperature .
The paper presents a laboratory investigation of the temperature - and light - dependence of autotrophic growth of the alga Chlorella:__entity__ minutissima:__entity__ .
It was isolated from the storage basin of a spring in the mountains of the Massif Central , France .
The alga was grown at temperatures between ( 10 and 35 ^ 0C ) and under irradiances from 30 to 550 mumol m ( - 2 ) s ( - 1 ) , under a light / dark cycle .
The results were fitted to selected descriptive models , seeking to express , as far as possible , the observed physiological behaviour of the strain and the minimum irradiance required to sustain net growth .
At all temperatures , the maximum rates of growth observed are strikingly slower than those of other Chlorella:__entity__ strains:__entity__ and of other small algae , reported in the literature , even when correction is made for continuous light .
The Q10 statistic for growth at temperatures & gt ; 20 ^ 0C rates is also noticeably lower than in other species , while the apparent threshold of any growth is about 8 ^ 0C .
Growth rates are readily light - saturated at all temperatures but with little evidence of adaptation of photosynthesis to low photon - flux rates .
No short - term flexibility in these properties ( over a time - scale of days ) was demonstrated during the course of our experiments .
We deduce that the algal strain had become genetically adapted to the relatively constant , even - temperature and low - light conditions of the spring - water habitat whence it was originally isolated .
Characterization of the oxysterol - binding protein gene family in the yellow:__entity__ fever:__entity__ mosquito:__entity__ , Aedes:__entity__ aegypti:__entity__ .
The oxysterol - binding protein ( OSBP ) and OSBP - related proteins ( ORPs ) are sterol - binding proteins that may be involved in cellular sterol transportation , sterol metabolism and signal transduction pathways .
Four ORP genes were cloned from Aedes:__entity__ aegypti:__entity__ .
Based on amino acid sequence homology to human:__entity__ proteins , they are AeOSBP , AeORP1 , AeORP8 and AeORP9 .
Splicing variants of AeOSBP and AeORP8 were identified .
The temporal and spatial transcription patterns of members of the AeOSBP gene family through developmental stages and the gonotrophic cycle were profiled .
AeORP1 transcription seemed to be head tissue - specific , whereas AeOSBP and AeORP9 expression was induced by a bloodmeal .
Furthermore , over - expression of AeORPs facilitated [ ( 3 ) H ] - cholesterol uptake in Ae:__entity__ .:__entity__ aegypti:__entity__ cultured Aag - 2 cells .
Identification and expression analysis of nervous wreck , which is preferentially expressed in the brain of the male silkworm:__entity__ moth:__entity__ , Bombyx:__entity__ mori:__entity__ .
Sexually dimorphic neural circuits are essential for reproductive behaviour .
The molecular basis of sexual dimorphism in the silkworm:__entity__ moth:__entity__ ( Bombyx:__entity__ mori:__entity__ ) brain , however , is unclear .
We conducted cDNA subtraction screening and identified nervous wreck ( Bmnwk ) , a synaptic growth regulatory gene , whose expression is higher in the male brain than in the female brain of the silkworm:__entity__ .
Bmnwk was preferentially expressed in the brain at the late pupae and adult stages .
In situ hybridization revealed that Bmnwk is highly expressed in the optic lobe of the male moth brain .
These findings suggest that Bmnwk has a role in the development and / or maintenance of the optic lobe in the male silkworm:__entity__ brain .
Infraciliature of eight Triplumaria species ( Ciliophora , Entodiniomorphida ) from Asian:__entity__ elephants:__entity__ with the description of six new species .
Intestinal ciliates excreted in the feces of Asian:__entity__ elephants:__entity__ were surveyed .
Fourteen species in the order Entodiniomorphida were detected .
Nine Triplumaria species in the family Cycloposthiidae were found .
Using the silver impregnation , two known species , T . antis and T . dvoinosi , were redescribed and six new species , T . sukuna n .
sp . , T . zuze n .
sp . , T . solea n .
sp . , T . suwako n .
sp . , T . fulgora n .
sp . , and T . harpagonis n .
sp . , were described .
T . sukuna , T . zuze , T . solea , and T . suwako have the perivestibular polybrachykinety along the vestibular opening .
The buccal infraciliary bands of T . suwako are similar to those of T:__entity__ .:__entity__ selenica:__entity__ found from elephants and the buccal infraciliary bands of T . sukuna , T . zuze , and T . solea are similar to those of T . grypoclunis described from rhinoceroses .
T . antis , T . dvoinosi , T . fulgora , and T . harpagonis have the vestibular polybrachykinety extending down inside the vestibulum as found in rumen ciliates in the family Ophryoscolecidae .
The caudalial ciliary zones of T . dvoinosi and T . fulgora were retractable as found in rumen ophryoscolecids .
Raabena:__entity__ bella:__entity__ and Pseudoentodinium elephantis showed high composition values over 30 % .
Ciliate densities in the three fecal samples were 0 . 15 , 1 . 09 , and 2 . 07x10 ( 4 ) / ml .
Prolixicin : a novel antimicrobial peptide isolated from Rhodnius:__entity__ prolixus:__entity__ with differential activity against bacteria and Trypanosoma:__entity__ cruzi:__entity__ .
We identified and characterized the activity of prolixicin , a novel antimicrobial peptide ( AMP ) isolated from the hemipteran insect , Rhodnius:__entity__ prolixus:__entity__ .
Sequence analysis reveals one region of prolixicin that may be related to the diptericin / attacin family of AMPs .
Prolixicin is an 11 - kDa peptide containing a putative 21 amino acid signal peptide , two putative phosphorylation sites and no glycosylation sites .
It is produced by both adult fat body and midgut tissues in response to bacterial infection of the haemolymph or the midgut .
Unlike most insect antibacterial peptides , the prolixicin gene does not seem to be regulated by NF - kappaB binding sites , but its promoter region contains several GATA sites .
Recombinant prolixicin has strong activity against the Gram - negative bacterium Escherichia:__entity__ coli:__entity__ and differential activity against several Gram - negative and Gram - positive bacteria .
No significant toxicity was demonstrated against Trypanosoma:__entity__ cruzi:__entity__ , the human:__entity__ parasite transmitted by R:__entity__ .:__entity__ prolixus:__entity__ .
Development Time and Body Size in Eupolyphaga:__entity__ sinensis:__entity__ Along a Latitudinal Gradient From China .
The responses of organisms to temperature variations may be via short term responses of the phenotype ( phenotypic plasticity ) , or they could involve long - term evolutionary change and adaptation ( via selection ) to the genotype .
These could involve changes to the mean size of the animal or to the thermal reaction norm .
We examined the effects of various temperatures ( of 22 , 25 , 28 , and 31 ^ 0C ) on development time , adult body size and preadult survivorship in three populations of the cockroach , Eupolyphaga:__entity__ sinensis:__entity__ ( Walker ) , collected at different latitudes .
We found substantial temperature - induced plasticity in development time , body size , and preadult survivorship , indicating that developmental temperatures have strong impacts on growth and life history traits of E:__entity__ .:__entity__ sinensis:__entity__ .
Genetic differences for development time , body size , and preadult survivorship were detected among populations , and the three traits exhibited highly significant variations in the responses of different populations to various temperature conditions , indicating genetic differences among populations in terms of thermal reaction norms .
We also found that two populations seem to support the beneficial acclimation hypothesis whereas the third mid - latitude population does not .
The results are likely because of differences in season length and voltinism , indicating that not only temperature regime but also its interactions with generation time ( and development time ) , voltinism , and season length are likely to have considerable effects on insect development time and body size .
Overall , changes in development time , body size , and preadult survivorship in E:__entity__ .:__entity__ sinensis:__entity__ can all be regarded as adaptations to changing thermal regimes .
Culture Independent Survey of the Microbiota of the Glassy:__entity__ -:__entity__ Winged:__entity__ Sharpshooter:__entity__ ( Homalodisca:__entity__ vitripennis:__entity__ ) Using 454 Pyrosequencing .
The glassy:__entity__ -:__entity__ winged:__entity__ sharpshooter:__entity__ , Homalodisca:__entity__ vitripennis:__entity__ (:__entity__ Germar:__entity__ ):__entity__ , is an invasive pest that has spread across the southern and western United States .
H:__entity__ .:__entity__ vitripennis:__entity__ is highly polyphagous and voracious , feeding on at least 100 plant species and consuming up to 100 times its weight in xylem fluid daily .
The insect is a vector of the phytopathogen Xylella:__entity__ fastidiosa:__entity__ (:__entity__ Wells:__entity__ ):__entity__ , which is the causative agent of Pierce ' s disease in grapevines .
To evaluate the microbial flora associated with H:__entity__ .:__entity__ vitripennis:__entity__ , total DNA extracts from hemolymph , alimentary canal excretions , and whole insect bodies were subjected to 16S rDNA pyrosequencing using the bTEFAP methodology and the resulting sequences ( 370 - 520 bp in length ) were compared with a curated high quality 16S database derived from GenBank http : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov .
Species from the genera Wolbachia , Delftia ( formerly Pseudomonas ) , Pectobacterium , Moraxella , Serratia , Bacillus , and many others were detected and a comprehensive picture of the microbiome associated with H:__entity__ .:__entity__ vitripennis:__entity__ was established .
Some of the bacteria identified in this report are initial discoveries ; providing a breadth of knowledge to the microbial flora of this insect pest can serve as a reservoir of information for developing biological control strategies .
Infection by Mycorrhizal Fungi Increases Natural Enemy Abundance on Tobacco ( Nicotiana:__entity__ rustica:__entity__ ) .
The presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi ( AMF ) influences plant nutrient uptake , growth , and plant defensive chemistry , thereby directly influencing multi - trophic interactions .
Different fungal isolates ( genotypes of the same fungal species ) have been shown to differ in nutrient uptake ability .
Plants infected with different AMF genotypes may vary in foliar nutrient or defensive chemical levels , potentially influencing multi - trophic interactions .
Using a completely randomized design , we compared the effect of two isolates of the mycorrhizal fungus Glomus:__entity__ etunicatum:__entity__ W .
N .
Becker & amp ; Gerdemann on silver:__entity__ leaf:__entity__ whitefly:__entity__ ( Bemisia:__entity__ argentifolii:__entity__ Bellows & amp ; Perring ) ( Hemiptera : Aleyrodidae ) and parasitic wasp ( Eretmocerus:__entity__ eremicus:__entity__ Rose & amp ; Zolnerowich ) ( Hymenoptera : Aphelinidae ) abundance .
Whitefly populations were not influenced by AMF infection .
Parasite populations were higher on plants infected with the isolate collected from Georgia , even after controlling for whitefly abundance and plant architecture .
We propose that AMF indirectly influences parasite abundance and parasitism through a change in leaf surface chemicals that affect parasitic wasps .
Because of the ubiquity of and genetic variation in AMF , multi - trophic interactions are likely to be strongly influenced by belowground processes .
The ability of selected pupal parasitoids ( hymenoptera : pteromalidae ) to locate stable:__entity__ fly:__entity__ hosts in a soiled equine bedding substrate .
The ability of Spalangia:__entity__ cameroni:__entity__ Perkins , Spalangia:__entity__ endius:__entity__ Walker , and Muscidifurax:__entity__ raptorellus:__entity__ Kogan and Legner to locate and attack stable:__entity__ fly:__entity__ hosts was evaluated under laboratory conditions .
Postfeeding third - instar stable:__entity__ fly:__entity__ larvae were released and allowed to pupate in two arena types : large 4 . 8 liter chambers containing a field - collected , soiled equine bedding substrate ; or 120 - ml plastic cups containing wood chips .
At the time of fly pupariation , parasitoids were released and permitted 72 h to locate and attack hosts .
On average , parasitism rates of freely accessible stable:__entity__ fly:__entity__ pupae in cups were not significantly different between parasitoid species .
However , parasitism rates in chambers containing either Spalangia spp . were = 50 - fold more than M:__entity__ .:__entity__ raptorellus:__entity__ .
Additional intraspecies analysis revealed that parasitism rates both by S:__entity__ .:__entity__ cameroni:__entity__ and S:__entity__ .:__entity__ endius:__entity__ were not significantly different when pupae were freely accessible or within bedding , whereas M:__entity__ .:__entity__ raptorellus:__entity__ attacked significantly more pupae in cups than in the larger chambers where hosts were distributed within bedding .
These results suggest that Spalangia spp . are more suited to successfully locate and attack hosts in habitats created by equine husbandry in Florida .
Therefore , commercially available parasitoid mixtures containing Muscidifurax spp . may be ineffective if used as a control measure at Florida equine facilities .
